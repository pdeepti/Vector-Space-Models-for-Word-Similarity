he talked with dw-world.de about his career as steinway & sons chief piano technician . franz mohr has a way of endearing himself to everyone he comes into contact with .
in his 30-year career as a piano technician for piano greats like vladimir horowitz , arthur rubenstein and glenn gould , mohr became more than just a highly valued tuner : he was also a friend and confident to the pianists he worked with . this was part of the success he had as steinway 's chief piano technician - a job that meant tempering not only grand pianos , but also dealing with the often unpredictable temperaments of the world famous artists who performed on them . 79-year-old mohr is a native of düren , germany , where he and his parents miraculously survived severe allied bombings in 1944 .
after training to be a piano technician in germany , he immigrated to new york in 1962 to accept a job with steinway & sons .
three years later , he became the piano maker 's chief piano technician , a role he took over from legendary tuner bill hupfer . dw-world.de : mr. mohr , how did your relationship to music begin ? franz mohr : i grew up with music .
i went to the hochschule für musik in cologne where i studied the violin .
then i developed tremendous physical problems with my left wrist .
it was terrible .
i had to take breaks and visited all kinds of doctors and finally had to come to the very painful decision that i could n't become a performing artist but had to do something else with my life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classic i saw an ad in a german music magazine that rudolf ibach sohn - the oldest piano manufacturing company in germany , founded in 1774 - was looking for apprentices .
i was already 24 years old at that time , but i thought , this also has something to do with music - why do n't i try it ?
they accepted me and i just loved working with my hands and learning about all the phases of piano building . the ultimate dream in the music world - at least as a piano technician - is steinway .
around 1954 , i applied for a job as a concert piano tuner for a concert management company in duesseldorf , which was also a steinway dealer .
and i got the job !
for the first time , i started to work on steinways and i really fell in love with them , both as a technician and as a musician . what is special about steinway pianos ? not only the design of a the piano , but also the quality of wood which goes into the piano are very important - especially when it comes to the sound board .
with this quality of wood you have a tremendously wide spectrum of tone colors . all the other instruments are mass produced , including yamaha - nothing against yamaha , but they build over 800 pianos a day and they have to use any kind of wood they come across .
their soundboard is , for instance , much thicker .
that counts for brilliance , which you need in any piano , but nothing else .
you play a pianissimo and it 's still too loud . we build steinways in two factories , in hamburg and new york , and we build 13 pianos a day .
that is the difference .
a steinway piano gets better and better all the time because of the quality of wood we use . in 1962 , you accepted a job as a piano technician with steinway & sons in new york .
did you have any difficulties adjusting to american culture when you came ? no , of course not .
we fell in love with america .
let me tell you a story : i 'd worked for many great artists in germany and had tuned for rudolf serkin there and in america .
the first thing he said to me when i visited him in vermont to work on his three concert grand pianos was , " franz , now we are in america where things are not so complicated .
now you can call me rudy . "
until that time he had always been " herr professor " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir horowitz when your predecessor bill hupfer retired in 1965 you took his position as chief piano technician .
at that point , you began working with vladimir horowitz , who you toured with and tuned for until his sudden death in 1989 .
what was horowitz like as a person ? of course , he was difficult and had a very complex personality .
you never knew when he would blow up and scream and whatever .
it took a long time before we really became such good friends .
many times before a concert he would say , " franz , you are the most important person here ! " horowitz was an accomplished steinway artist in russia when he was 19 years old .
when he ran away from russia " with a thousand rubles in his shoes " , as he always said , he came to berlin .
and immediately all the german piano companies - bösendorf , bechstein , blühtner - they all wanted him to try their pianos so he would play their product .
he tried them all , but there was never any doubt in his mind about steinway . after his death , i still traveled with his piano .
we will take the horowitz piano to japan soon and i 'm going with the piano . who else played horowitz 's piano ? in his lifetime , only one person .
that was murray perahia .
he was flabbergasted , of course , that horowitz let him play it .
but after the first piece he came back and said , " franz , i 'm sorry but i can not handle it . " each steinway is different - it feels different and sound different .
and each artist has different requirements .
horowitz died and we wanted to send the piano on tour .
but i was so afraid : who would be able to manage that piano ?
i did have to change a few things , but people just love it . what was it like to tour with horowitz ? it was wonderful !
horowitz only played on sundays and the rehearsals were always saturdays and the rest of the week i could go sightseeing .
he said , " franz bring your wife and your children , i 'll pay . "
i knew exactly what he wanted in the piano and it was a wonderful relationship - i was part of the family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glenn gould as soon as you arrived in the us in 1962 , you had the chance to work with glenn gould , who was known for being somewhat eccentric .
how did you get along with him ? my predecessor , bill hupfer , had recording session at the famous 30th street columbia record studio where he tuned for glenn gould .
he fell into disgrace with glenn gould and i had been in america for just a few days . bill should have known better : he went to glenn just before the recording session , put his hand on his shoulder , and asked him how he was doing .
later glenn claimed his shoulder had been dislocated because the tuner had slapped him on the shoulder , which was n't true .
he had to cancel concerts and had a lawsuit with steinway . bill could n't tune for him anymore , so i was sent by steinway to take care of glenn gould .
over the years we became very good friends .
i went nearly every month to toronto to do his recording in the later years .
he knew that i would come to toronto with rubenstein or horowitz or serkin and he would never go to anyone 's concert .
but he knew that i was coming and he would pick me up at the airport and make sure we spent the evening together , listening to recordings and talking . you know so many of the top pianists from the 20th century - both musically and personally .
do you see any patterns ?
what makes them great ? in german we call it " ausstrahlung " - a presence , a communication from the stage to the people , which many people do not have .
if you have this , it does n't even matter if you play a lot of wrong notes .
of course , rubenstein , horowitz and serkin had this . franz mohr lives in new york and , though nearing 80 , he still travels regularly as a piano technician , teacher and lecturer .
he currently tours with italian pianist mauricio pollini .
mohr 's book , " my life with the great pianists " , has been translated into seven languages and is available at most online bookstores . kate bowen interviewed franz mohr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart : a pop icon with staying power from his beginnings as a child prodigy under the thumb of a demanding father to later year-long tours and an extravagant lifestyle , mozart set the pop star bar high , even for today 's standards .

he talked with dw-world.de about his career as steinway & sons chief piano technician . franz mohr has a way of endearing himself to everyone he comes into contact with .
in his 30-year career as a piano technician for piano greats like vladimir horowitz , arthur rubenstein and glenn gould , mohr became more than just a highly valued tuner : he was also a friend and confident to the pianists he worked with . this was part of the success he had as steinway 's chief piano technician - a job that meant tempering not only grand pianos , but also dealing with the often unpredictable temperaments of the world famous artists who performed on them . 79-year-old mohr is a native of düren , germany , where he and his parents miraculously survived severe allied bombings in 1944 .
after training to be a piano technician in germany , he immigrated to new york in 1962 to accept a job with steinway & sons .
three years later , he became the piano maker 's chief piano technician , a role he took over from legendary tuner bill hupfer . dw-world.de : mr. mohr , how did your relationship to music begin ? franz mohr : i grew up with music .
i went to the hochschule für musik in cologne where i studied the violin .
then i developed tremendous physical problems with my left wrist .
it was terrible .
i had to take breaks and visited all kinds of doctors and finally had to come to the very painful decision that i could n't become a performing artist but had to do something else with my life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classic i saw an ad in a german music magazine that rudolf ibach sohn - the oldest piano manufacturing company in germany , founded in 1774 - was looking for apprentices .
i was already 24 years old at that time , but i thought , this also has something to do with music - why do n't i try it ?
they accepted me and i just loved working with my hands and learning about all the phases of piano building . the ultimate dream in the music world - at least as a piano technician - is steinway .
around 1954 , i applied for a job as a concert piano tuner for a concert management company in duesseldorf , which was also a steinway dealer .
and i got the job !
for the first time , i started to work on steinways and i really fell in love with them , both as a technician and as a musician . what is special about steinway pianos ? not only the design of a the piano , but also the quality of wood which goes into the piano are very important - especially when it comes to the sound board .
with this quality of wood you have a tremendously wide spectrum of tone colors . all the other instruments are mass produced , including yamaha - nothing against yamaha , but they build over 800 pianos a day and they have to use any kind of wood they come across .
their soundboard is , for instance , much thicker .
that counts for brilliance , which you need in any piano , but nothing else .
you play a pianissimo and it 's still too loud . we build steinways in two factories , in hamburg and new york , and we build 13 pianos a day .
that is the difference .
a steinway piano gets better and better all the time because of the quality of wood we use . in 1962 , you accepted a job as a piano technician with steinway & sons in new york .
did you have any difficulties adjusting to american culture when you came ? no , of course not .
we fell in love with america .
let me tell you a story : i 'd worked for many great artists in germany and had tuned for rudolf serkin there and in america .
the first thing he said to me when i visited him in vermont to work on his three concert grand pianos was , " franz , now we are in america where things are not so complicated .
now you can call me rudy . "
until that time he had always been " herr professor " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir horowitz when your predecessor bill hupfer retired in 1965 you took his position as chief piano technician .
at that point , you began working with vladimir horowitz , who you toured with and tuned for until his sudden death in 1989 .
what was horowitz like as a person ? of course , he was difficult and had a very complex personality .
you never knew when he would blow up and scream and whatever .
it took a long time before we really became such good friends .
many times before a concert he would say , " franz , you are the most important person here ! " horowitz was an accomplished steinway artist in russia when he was 19 years old .
when he ran away from russia " with a thousand rubles in his shoes " , as he always said , he came to berlin .
and immediately all the german piano companies - bösendorf , bechstein , blühtner - they all wanted him to try their pianos so he would play their product .
he tried them all , but there was never any doubt in his mind about steinway . after his death , i still traveled with his piano .
we will take the horowitz piano to japan soon and i 'm going with the piano . who else played horowitz 's piano ? in his lifetime , only one person .
that was murray perahia .
he was flabbergasted , of course , that horowitz let him play it .
but after the first piece he came back and said , " franz , i 'm sorry but i can not handle it . " each steinway is different - it feels different and sound different .
and each artist has different requirements .
horowitz died and we wanted to send the piano on tour .
but i was so afraid : who would be able to manage that piano ?
i did have to change a few things , but people just love it . what was it like to tour with horowitz ? it was wonderful !
horowitz only played on sundays and the rehearsals were always saturdays and the rest of the week i could go sightseeing .
he said , " franz bring your wife and your children , i 'll pay . "
i knew exactly what he wanted in the piano and it was a wonderful relationship - i was part of the family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glenn gould as soon as you arrived in the us in 1962 , you had the chance to work with glenn gould , who was known for being somewhat eccentric .
how did you get along with him ? my predecessor , bill hupfer , had recording session at the famous 30th street columbia record studio where he tuned for glenn gould .
he fell into disgrace with glenn gould and i had been in america for just a few days . bill should have known better : he went to glenn just before the recording session , put his hand on his shoulder , and asked him how he was doing .
later glenn claimed his shoulder had been dislocated because the tuner had slapped him on the shoulder , which was n't true .
he had to cancel concerts and had a lawsuit with steinway . bill could n't tune for him anymore , so i was sent by steinway to take care of glenn gould .
over the years we became very good friends .
i went nearly every month to toronto to do his recording in the later years .
he knew that i would come to toronto with rubenstein or horowitz or serkin and he would never go to anyone 's concert .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sounds like germany krautrock created a new sound for a new generation german rap keeps it real mozart classic gets street treatment in berlin update happy birthday , herbert grönemeyer ! culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.07.2006 the man behind the pianist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz mohr has always been more than a mere piano technician after a career tuning pianos for horowitz , gould and others , franz mohr knows what makes a good piano - and pianist .
he talked with dw-world.de about his career as steinway & sons chief piano technician . franz mohr has a way of endearing himself to everyone he comes into contact with .
in his 30-year career as a piano technician for piano greats like vladimir horowitz , arthur rubenstein and glenn gould , mohr became more than just a highly valued tuner : he was also a friend and confident to the pianists he worked with . this was part of the success he had as steinway 's chief piano technician - a job that meant tempering not only grand pianos , but also dealing with the often unpredictable temperaments of the world famous artists who performed on them . 79-year-old mohr is a native of düren , germany , where he and his parents miraculously survived severe allied bombings in 1944 .
after training to be a piano technician in germany , he immigrated to new york in 1962 to accept a job with steinway & sons .
three years later , he became the piano maker 's chief piano technician , a role he took over from legendary tuner bill hupfer . dw-world.de : mr. mohr , how did your relationship to music begin ? franz mohr : i grew up with music .
i went to the hochschule für musik in cologne where i studied the violin .
then i developed tremendous physical problems with my left wrist .
it was terrible .
i had to take breaks and visited all kinds of doctors and finally had to come to the very painful decision that i could n't become a performing artist but had to do something else with my life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classic i saw an ad in a german music magazine that rudolf ibach sohn - the oldest piano manufacturing company in germany , founded in 1774 - was looking for apprentices .
i was already 24 years old at that time , but i thought , this also has something to do with music - why do n't i try it ?
they accepted me and i just loved working with my hands and learning about all the phases of piano building . the ultimate dream in the music world - at least as a piano technician - is steinway .
around 1954 , i applied for a job as a concert piano tuner for a concert management company in duesseldorf , which was also a steinway dealer .
and i got the job !
for the first time , i started to work on steinways and i really fell in love with them , both as a technician and as a musician . what is special about steinway pianos ? not only the design of a the piano , but also the quality of wood which goes into the piano are very important - especially when it comes to the sound board .
with this quality of wood you have a tremendously wide spectrum of tone colors . all the other instruments are mass produced , including yamaha - nothing against yamaha , but they build over 800 pianos a day and they have to use any kind of wood they come across .
their soundboard is , for instance , much thicker .
that counts for brilliance , which you need in any piano , but nothing else .
you play a pianissimo and it 's still too loud . we build steinways in two factories , in hamburg and new york , and we build 13 pianos a day .
that is the difference .
a steinway piano gets better and better all the time because of the quality of wood we use . in 1962 , you accepted a job as a piano technician with steinway & sons in new york .
did you have any difficulties adjusting to american culture when you came ? no , of course not .
we fell in love with america .
let me tell you a story : i 'd worked for many great artists in germany and had tuned for rudolf serkin there and in america .
the first thing he said to me when i visited him in vermont to work on his three concert grand pianos was , " franz , now we are in america where things are not so complicated .
now you can call me rudy . "
until that time he had always been " herr professor " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir horowitz when your predecessor bill hupfer retired in 1965 you took his position as chief piano technician .
at that point , you began working with vladimir horowitz , who you toured with and tuned for until his sudden death in 1989 .
what was horowitz like as a person ? of course , he was difficult and had a very complex personality .
you never knew when he would blow up and scream and whatever .
it took a long time before we really became such good friends .
many times before a concert he would say , " franz , you are the most important person here ! " horowitz was an accomplished steinway artist in russia when he was 19 years old .
when he ran away from russia " with a thousand rubles in his shoes " , as he always said , he came to berlin .
and immediately all the german piano companies - bösendorf , bechstein , blühtner - they all wanted him to try their pianos so he would play their product .
he tried them all , but there was never any doubt in his mind about steinway . after his death , i still traveled with his piano .
we will take the horowitz piano to japan soon and i 'm going with the piano . who else played horowitz 's piano ? in his lifetime , only one person .
that was murray perahia .
he was flabbergasted , of course , that horowitz let him play it .
but after the first piece he came back and said , " franz , i 'm sorry but i can not handle it . " each steinway is different - it feels different and sound different .
and each artist has different requirements .
horowitz died and we wanted to send the piano on tour .
but i was so afraid : who would be able to manage that piano ?
i did have to change a few things , but people just love it . what was it like to tour with horowitz ? it was wonderful !
horowitz only played on sundays and the rehearsals were always saturdays and the rest of the week i could go sightseeing .
he said , " franz bring your wife and your children , i 'll pay . "
i knew exactly what he wanted in the piano and it was a wonderful relationship - i was part of the family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glenn gould as soon as you arrived in the us in 1962 , you had the chance to work with glenn gould , who was known for being somewhat eccentric .
how did you get along with him ? my predecessor , bill hupfer , had recording session at the famous 30th street columbia record studio where he tuned for glenn gould .
he fell into disgrace with glenn gould and i had been in america for just a few days . bill should have known better : he went to glenn just before the recording session , put his hand on his shoulder , and asked him how he was doing .
later glenn claimed his shoulder had been dislocated because the tuner had slapped him on the shoulder , which was n't true .
he had to cancel concerts and had a lawsuit with steinway . bill could n't tune for him anymore , so i was sent by steinway to take care of glenn gould .
over the years we became very good friends .
i went nearly every month to toronto to do his recording in the later years .
he knew that i would come to toronto with rubenstein or horowitz or serkin and he would never go to anyone 's concert .
but he knew that i was coming and he would pick me up at the airport and make sure we spent the evening together , listening to recordings and talking . you know so many of the top pianists from the 20th century - both musically and personally .
do you see any patterns ?
what makes them great ? in german we call it " ausstrahlung " - a presence , a communication from the stage to the people , which many people do not have .
if you have this , it does n't even matter if you play a lot of wrong notes .
of course , rubenstein , horowitz and serkin had this . franz mohr lives in new york and , though nearing 80 , he still travels regularly as a piano technician , teacher and lecturer .
he currently tours with italian pianist mauricio pollini .
mohr 's book , " my life with the great pianists " , has been translated into seven languages and is available at most online bookstores . kate bowen interviewed franz mohr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart : a pop icon with staying power from his beginnings as a child prodigy under the thumb of a demanding father to later year-long tours and an extravagant lifestyle , mozart set the pop star bar high , even for today 's standards .

so the club , culture on the road , is stepping in , fighting intolerance , violence and racism through music . in eastern germany , skinheads and others attracted to the far-right are not in the minority .
for example , in local elections in saxony in 2004 , almost one out of every four first-time voters chose the rightwing npd party .
one reason for the party 's good performance in the elections is that it provides jobs to the young . the club , culture on the road , is trying to take on and embrace the diversity of youth culture .
it does n't matter whether it is punk , hip hop or black metal - anything is better than the right fringe .
the club offers information , holds discussions and workshops keeping in mind , the style , music and political background of the diverse youth movements . a record as a tool it is dj training class at a special school for the learning-disabled in blankenhain in the eastern german state of thuringia .
and instead of math homework , the students sit curious before two turntables .
peer wiechmann shows the students how to lay a record down and find the right beat . " you take your hand and lay the record , here and there , " he tells the kids .
" at first , try to be relatively even so that you produce a real beat .
and after you feel more secure , try and lay another down and get another beat to overlay on the first . " everyone gets a change to try it .
bastian , 14 , is really getting into it .
" it is really interesting to do it yourself , " he said .
" and also to get tips and learn something new from someone with experience . weichmann answers all the kids questions , shows tricks .
but he also knows that he is no dj . youth culture is tolerant wiechmann comes from the weimar-based network against rightwing extremism who issued the contract for the event .
afterward , he picked up his team in berlin on the way to blankenhain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project aims to engage young people in meaninful discussions " we have a strong sense of camaraderie and commitment , " he said .
" and we try to capture the children through music and dance .
youth culture is essentially by its nature tolerant , diverse and international .
that is what we communicate and everyone seems to like that . " culture on the road is a colourful team of 15 young people .
several members of the group have studied political science and are especially familiar with right-wing extremist ideology .
others come from different youth scenes such as hip hop , techno or metal .
an american member of the group played in a punk band for years .
she offers day-long workshops with music . in the east , hating foreigners is normal silke baer is responsible for the concept .
she wants with the project above all to reach those young people in the new eastern german states , where she says that the group has learned through experience that " seeing foreigners as the enemy is an absolutely normal thing . " " we go into this region and talk with kids about youth culture through political discussions , " she said .
" in this way , we try to bring them closer into the democratic fold . " that most youth culture comes from abroad is one point , she says .
another is the history of such movements .
for example , hardly any kids know that the punk movement of the 1970s arose out of the high unemployment in the younger ranks in the uk .
this is something that baer knows only too well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : culture is one way to reach those hard-to-reach young people sociologist michaela glaser from the german youth institute in halle says that these types of youth projects are indispensable . " the important thing is that there is first access to the young in order to be able to work with them , " she said .
" and it is just these projects , in our experience , that help the young become more open and be ready for future conflicts . " not a one-time thing and it is also important to be consistent and not have such projects be a one-time occurrence otherwise they will be in vain , said glaser .
that is a danger in many communities with empty cash registers who have already stricken youth programs from their tight budgets . corinna hundshagen , the director of the blankenhain school says that her staff wants to remain on the ball . " i have already spoken to peer weichmann and requested that at the very least , he should remain in contact , " she said .
" we want to do certain projects still with our local youth club .

but the family-run company has humble roots - it began by transporting furniture and offering bus tours , said gerald kassner the company 's sole proprietor . the business ' name came from kassner 's grand father , who founded the company .
the first bus tours offered in the 1950s took tourists to the black forest and kassner 's grandfather was so impressed with the 1,284-meter -lrb- 4,213-foot -rrb- schauinsland mountain the visitors went to see near the city of freiburg , he named his company after it .
the name translates roughly to " look into the country . " taking on the big boys , and winning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's beaches are popular among for german tourists visitors ca n't book bus tours with schauinsland travel anymore , but they can fly with the company to tourist destinations , as some 350,000 people do every year .
half of the tourists head to spain or the canary islands with others boarding flights for egypt , tunisia and the dominican republic , contributing to the company 's 200 million euros -lrb- $ 253 million -rrb- in revenues and 20 percent growth . however .
kassner , who employees 90 people , said he does not want to become a major international player in the branch , not to mention be swallowed up by another company . " we do not owe anything to shareholders and do not have any subsidiaries , " he said .
" the capital stays with the company so that we have the chance to work effectively . " breaking the unwritten rules schauinsland surprised a number of the travel industry 's larger companies for its willingness to break the branch 's unwritten rule of keeping customers locked into all-inclusive flight and hotel deals . " with us you can book just the hotel or you can combine the hotel with other flights , " kassner said .
" we have a lot of combination possibilities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early negotiation can make gettting a fair price difficult the some 10,000 of germany 's 12,000 travel agents who offer schauinsland tours also know what they can offer customers long before they 've heard from other tour companies .
the duisburg company 's winter 2006/2007 catalog landed on desks in may , considerably earlier than its competitors who do n't tend to start thinking about it until the second half of the year . this means the hardest part of kassner 's job - negotiating room prices with hotels - also has to be done earlier . " the individual hotels do not always want to publish their prices so early , especially attractive , fair-market prices , " he said , adding that company representatives went on a shopping trip in april to work out lower prices .

" the heat wave is going to last , " said france 's health minister xavier bertrand , stressing that the priority was to watch out for people living in isolated circumstances who are particularly vulnerable to the heat . though temperatures dropped in parts of northern france , weather authorities said the respite would be short , warning of a further peak on wednesday . those who died in france this week included 10 people aged 80 to 94 , as well as laborers at work and a 15-month-old baby . national radio broadcast messages to the elderly on saturday , explaining the effects of the heat and how to combat them and giving a telephone advice-line number . france on " orange " alert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping cool is a priority french forecasters have placed the eastern half of the country on " orange " alert - the second highest level .
temperatures were expected to reach 38 degrees celsius -lrb- 100 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in the rhone valley , though cooler weather was forecast for sunday . violent storms struck the dordogne region of south-central france overnight , killing a motorcyclist who ran into a fallen tree .
scores of firemen were mobilized and lightning caused half a dozen forest fires . air quality authorities in northeastern france said levels of pollutant ozone chemicals in the air had exceeded recommended levels for four days running in the heat wave , though the levels returned to normal later saturday . more than 30 people are believed to have died since the start of the week in western europe . spain is used to such temperatures , but six provinces of the country were nevertheless on alert this weekend after three heat-related deaths , as the thermometer was expected to nudge 40 degrees celsius . tropical austrian nights a german truck driver in austria died in his cabin of a heart attack brought on by the high temperature which reached 37 degrees celsius in parts of the country , rescuers said . austrians have this summer experienced a soaring number of restless tropical nights , defined as nights when the temperature passes 20 degrees celsius , meteorological officials said . hungarian authorities distributed water in busy parts of the capital budapest to prevent dehydration and trains across the country were ordered to lower their speed owing to problems with the tracks caused by heat . new heat wave expected next week bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sales of fans are rising along with the temperature in britain forecasters warned that the present relief , welcome after wednesday - which saw the hottest july day on record - was likely to be followed by another heat wave next week . " we will have another heat wave similar to this week , " said forecaster steve randall from the meteorological office .
" the weekend will be cooler with a risk of thunderstorms - but temperatures will still be above average for the time of year . " in italy temperatures were set to reach 40 degrees celsius over the weekend , and the regions of liguria in the northeast and umbria in the centre were placed on the highest level of alert . in berlin the building union ig bau launched a publicity campaign under the slogan " do n't get burned " , and distributed tubes of sunscreen cream at work-sites . the heat eased meanwhile in belgium , where 15,000 people packed into trains to the seaside on saturday morning , despite rainstorms in parts of the country . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans sweat as summer 2006 prepares to break records temperatures across europe were expected to smash records this week as the current heat wave showed no signs of abating .

but the family-run company has humble roots - it began by transporting furniture and offering bus tours , said gerald kassner the company 's sole proprietor . the business ' name came from kassner 's grand father , who founded the company .
the first bus tours offered in the 1950s took tourists to the black forest and kassner 's grandfather was so impressed with the 1,284-meter -lrb- 4,213-foot -rrb- schauinsland mountain the visitors went to see near the city of freiburg , he named his company after it .
the name translates roughly to " look into the country . " taking on the big boys , and winning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's beaches are popular among for german tourists visitors ca n't book bus tours with schauinsland travel anymore , but they can fly with the company to tourist destinations , as some 350,000 people do every year .
half of the tourists head to spain or the canary islands with others boarding flights for egypt , tunisia and the dominican republic , contributing to the company 's 200 million euros -lrb- $ 253 million -rrb- in revenues and 20 percent growth . however .
kassner , who employees 90 people , said he does not want to become a major international player in the branch , not to mention be swallowed up by another company . " we do not owe anything to shareholders and do not have any subsidiaries , " he said .
" the capital stays with the company so that we have the chance to work effectively . " breaking the unwritten rules schauinsland surprised a number of the travel industry 's larger companies for its willingness to break the branch 's unwritten rule of keeping customers locked into all-inclusive flight and hotel deals . " with us you can book just the hotel or you can combine the hotel with other flights , " kassner said .
" we have a lot of combination possibilities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early negotiation can make gettting a fair price difficult the some 10,000 of germany 's 12,000 travel agents who offer schauinsland tours also know what they can offer customers long before they 've heard from other tour companies .
the duisburg company 's winter 2006/2007 catalog landed on desks in may , considerably earlier than its competitors who do n't tend to start thinking about it until the second half of the year . this means the hardest part of kassner 's job - negotiating room prices with hotels - also has to be done earlier . " the individual hotels do not always want to publish their prices so early , especially attractive , fair-market prices , " he said , adding that company representatives went on a shopping trip in april to work out lower prices .
" the bookings arriving for the coming winter are very positive .

" the heat wave is going to last , " said france 's health minister xavier bertrand , stressing that the priority was to watch out for people living in isolated circumstances who are particularly vulnerable to the heat . though temperatures dropped in parts of northern france , weather authorities said the respite would be short , warning of a further peak on wednesday . those who died in france this week included 10 people aged 80 to 94 , as well as laborers at work and a 15-month-old baby . national radio broadcast messages to the elderly on saturday , explaining the effects of the heat and how to combat them and giving a telephone advice-line number . france on " orange " alert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping cool is a priority french forecasters have placed the eastern half of the country on " orange " alert - the second highest level .

" we must strive to stop extremist forces from wanting to broaden the scope of the conflict , " he said . " we are making all efforts to create the suitable conditions which will allow for a ceasefire , within a political framework aimed at reaching permanent stability in the region , " steinmeier said . israel launched its massive offensive on lebanon after the lebanese shiite group hezbollah captured two israeli soldiers in a border region on july 12 with the aim of securing a prisoner exchange . in 11 days , the conflict has killed more than 340 people in lebanon , more than 30 in israel , and forced upwards of half a million lebanese to flee their homes . complex ceasefire conditions but for his part abul gheit insisted that a prisoner swap should be part of these conditions and stressed the need for a ceasefire .

the crazy ruler , as many called him , commissioned the construction of castle after castle - whose grandiosity and splendor eventually led to his ruin . the most famous among king ludwig 's castle collection is neuschwanstein , located in southern bavaria .
this sightseeing must is high on the list of nearly every tourist to germany , which is why efforts have been made in the past few years to ease the flow of visitors with a new " traffic control " system . longs waits were the biggest complaint among castle guests , but administrator klaus peter scheck explained that things have changed : " when the visitor buys a ticket he receives an entry time and a tour time printed on the ticket , along with a tour number . " once a quiet retreat , now viewed by millions though waits have been shortened , visitors still have to take into account the 30 minute drive there , as the castle is perched on the top of a cliff 1,000 meters -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- high .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle attracts around 1.3 million tourists per year those who venture there will be well rewarded .
king ludwig 's aim was to build an " ideal castle , " based on old knights ' castles - a goal most would say he achieved . though it was meant as a place of quiet retreat for the mad king and not for the public , the neuschwanstein castle was opened to visitors shortly after his death in 1886 .
since that time , some 1.3 million people come each year to be dazzled by the gold and glitter , velvet and silk , kitsch and art that the castle has to offer . a room for richard wagner " there are around 90 rooms , 16 of which are fully restored , " described klaus peter scheck , " the most important room in the castle is the " sängersaal " -lrb- singers ' hall -rrb- .
art historians say it 's the reason why the castle was built in the first place . " the singers ' hall , ornamented with golden chandeliers , was dedicated to the composer richard wagner .
scenes from wagner 's operas , which are based on german mythology , adorn walls throughout the castle . king ludwig was not known for having a grip on reality , espcially the reality of his finances . the neuschwanstein castle overextended his financial resources .
in 1886 , the 40-year-old king was declared unfit and ejected from the throne .
shortly thereafter , he took his own life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion has changed a bit since king ludwig 's era a hi-tech castle from the beginning but the mad king 's fairy tale castle lives on - for as many as 6,000 visitors a day , in peak season . in addition to the tour appointment system , a new museum shop has been added to the site .
not only the usual knickknacks but also more intellectual items can be found there , like the bavarian castle administration 's publication . a solution to waiting in long lines at the museum shop has also been implemented : tech savvy visitors can order online at neuschwanstein 's own internet book shop . it 's only fitting that the castle should carry on ludwig 's hi-tech approach .
in those days , all the rooms were warmed via a hot-air central heating system and each floor had running water - modern luxuries back then . keeping up with the upkeep however , being built with up-to-date accouterments has n't kept the castle from aging over the years . " the biggest problem is the visitors themselves " because they bring moisture with them , admitted scheck .
" all the textiles and murals suffer from the moisture . " on the other hand , the fact that the castle has n't been heated in 130 years has minimized the damage , added the castle director .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be one of the next seven wonders of the world in addition to the visitors , mother nature also makes regular upkeep around the castle a necessity .
the cliffs that the castle rests on have to be continually reinforced because weather wears the limestone away . both regular maintenance and the latest major improvements have n't been cheap .
the state of bavaria has spent 11 million euros -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in the last 15 years on renovations and the new " traffic control " system for visitors .
that may sound like a lot , but neuschwanstein is also a good source of income . the next world wonder ? what 's more , the investment may be rewarded with something priceless : a coveted " seven wonders of the world " title . a former unesco staff member came up with idea to revise the long-standing list of wonders and a committee of experts selected 21 cultural sites throughout the world , including neuschwanstein .
until july 2007 , anyone can place their vote for the bavarian castle by visiting www.neuschwanstein.de. neuschwanstein as one of the next wonders of the world ?
maybe it 's a bit crazy - but king ludwig certainly would have like the idea . gaby reucher -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neuschwanstein : mad ludwig 's magical refuge from reality no visit to germany would be complete without seeing the castle that inspired disney 's magical kingdom .

so the club , culture on the road , is stepping in , fighting intolerance , violence and racism through music . in eastern germany , skinheads and others attracted to the far-right are not in the minority .
for example , in local elections in saxony in 2004 , almost one out of every four first-time voters chose the rightwing npd party .
one reason for the party 's good performance in the elections is that it provides jobs to the young . the club , culture on the road , is trying to take on and embrace the diversity of youth culture .
it does n't matter whether it is punk , hip hop or black metal - anything is better than the right fringe .
the club offers information , holds discussions and workshops keeping in mind , the style , music and political background of the diverse youth movements . a record as a tool it is dj training class at a special school for the learning-disabled in blankenhain in the eastern german state of thuringia .
and instead of math homework , the students sit curious before two turntables .
peer wiechmann shows the students how to lay a record down and find the right beat . " you take your hand and lay the record , here and there , " he tells the kids .
" at first , try to be relatively even so that you produce a real beat .
and after you feel more secure , try and lay another down and get another beat to overlay on the first . " everyone gets a change to try it .
bastian , 14 , is really getting into it .
" it is really interesting to do it yourself , " he said .
" and also to get tips and learn something new from someone with experience . weichmann answers all the kids questions , shows tricks .
but he also knows that he is no dj . youth culture is tolerant wiechmann comes from the weimar-based network against rightwing extremism who issued the contract for the event .
afterward , he picked up his team in berlin on the way to blankenhain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project aims to engage young people in meaninful discussions " we have a strong sense of camaraderie and commitment , " he said .
" and we try to capture the children through music and dance .
youth culture is essentially by its nature tolerant , diverse and international .
that is what we communicate and everyone seems to like that . " culture on the road is a colourful team of 15 young people .
several members of the group have studied political science and are especially familiar with right-wing extremist ideology .
others come from different youth scenes such as hip hop , techno or metal .
an american member of the group played in a punk band for years .
she offers day-long workshops with music . in the east , hating foreigners is normal silke baer is responsible for the concept .
she wants with the project above all to reach those young people in the new eastern german states , where she says that the group has learned through experience that " seeing foreigners as the enemy is an absolutely normal thing . " " we go into this region and talk with kids about youth culture through political discussions , " she said .
" in this way , we try to bring them closer into the democratic fold . " that most youth culture comes from abroad is one point , she says .
another is the history of such movements .
for example , hardly any kids know that the punk movement of the 1970s arose out of the high unemployment in the younger ranks in the uk .
this is something that baer knows only too well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : culture is one way to reach those hard-to-reach young people sociologist michaela glaser from the german youth institute in halle says that these types of youth projects are indispensable . " the important thing is that there is first access to the young in order to be able to work with them , " she said .
" and it is just these projects , in our experience , that help the young become more open and be ready for future conflicts . " not a one-time thing and it is also important to be consistent and not have such projects be a one-time occurrence otherwise they will be in vain , said glaser .
that is a danger in many communities with empty cash registers who have already stricken youth programs from their tight budgets . corinna hundshagen , the director of the blankenhain school says that her staff wants to remain on the ball . " i have already spoken to peer weichmann and requested that at the very least , he should remain in contact , " she said .
" we want to do certain projects still with our local youth club .
we have made a start and now we have to see how we can move forward .

the crazy ruler , as many called him , commissioned the construction of castle after castle - whose grandiosity and splendor eventually led to his ruin . the most famous among king ludwig 's castle collection is neuschwanstein , located in southern bavaria .
this sightseeing must is high on the list of nearly every tourist to germany , which is why efforts have been made in the past few years to ease the flow of visitors with a new " traffic control " system . longs waits were the biggest complaint among castle guests , but administrator klaus peter scheck explained that things have changed : " when the visitor buys a ticket he receives an entry time and a tour time printed on the ticket , along with a tour number . " once a quiet retreat , now viewed by millions though waits have been shortened , visitors still have to take into account the 30 minute drive there , as the castle is perched on the top of a cliff 1,000 meters -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- high .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle attracts around 1.3 million tourists per year those who venture there will be well rewarded .
king ludwig 's aim was to build an " ideal castle , " based on old knights ' castles - a goal most would say he achieved . though it was meant as a place of quiet retreat for the mad king and not for the public , the neuschwanstein castle was opened to visitors shortly after his death in 1886 .
since that time , some 1.3 million people come each year to be dazzled by the gold and glitter , velvet and silk , kitsch and art that the castle has to offer . a room for richard wagner " there are around 90 rooms , 16 of which are fully restored , " described klaus peter scheck , " the most important room in the castle is the " sängersaal " -lrb- singers ' hall -rrb- .
art historians say it 's the reason why the castle was built in the first place . " the singers ' hall , ornamented with golden chandeliers , was dedicated to the composer richard wagner .
scenes from wagner 's operas , which are based on german mythology , adorn walls throughout the castle . king ludwig was not known for having a grip on reality , espcially the reality of his finances . the neuschwanstein castle overextended his financial resources .
in 1886 , the 40-year-old king was declared unfit and ejected from the throne .
shortly thereafter , he took his own life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion has changed a bit since king ludwig 's era a hi-tech castle from the beginning but the mad king 's fairy tale castle lives on - for as many as 6,000 visitors a day , in peak season . in addition to the tour appointment system , a new museum shop has been added to the site .
not only the usual knickknacks but also more intellectual items can be found there , like the bavarian castle administration 's publication . a solution to waiting in long lines at the museum shop has also been implemented : tech savvy visitors can order online at neuschwanstein 's own internet book shop . it 's only fitting that the castle should carry on ludwig 's hi-tech approach .
in those days , all the rooms were warmed via a hot-air central heating system and each floor had running water - modern luxuries back then . keeping up with the upkeep however , being built with up-to-date accouterments has n't kept the castle from aging over the years . " the biggest problem is the visitors themselves " because they bring moisture with them , admitted scheck .
" all the textiles and murals suffer from the moisture . " on the other hand , the fact that the castle has n't been heated in 130 years has minimized the damage , added the castle director .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be one of the next seven wonders of the world in addition to the visitors , mother nature also makes regular upkeep around the castle a necessity .
the cliffs that the castle rests on have to be continually reinforced because weather wears the limestone away . both regular maintenance and the latest major improvements have n't been cheap .
the state of bavaria has spent 11 million euros -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in the last 15 years on renovations and the new " traffic control " system for visitors .
that may sound like a lot , but neuschwanstein is also a good source of income . the next world wonder ? what 's more , the investment may be rewarded with something priceless : a coveted " seven wonders of the world " title . a former unesco staff member came up with idea to revise the long-standing list of wonders and a committee of experts selected 21 cultural sites throughout the world , including neuschwanstein .
until july 2007 , anyone can place their vote for the bavarian castle by visiting www.neuschwanstein.de. neuschwanstein as one of the next wonders of the world ?
maybe it 's a bit crazy - but king ludwig certainly would have like the idea . gaby reucher -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neuschwanstein : mad ludwig 's magical refuge from reality no visit to germany would be complete without seeing the castle that inspired disney 's magical kingdom .

so the club , culture on the road , is stepping in , fighting intolerance , violence and racism through music . in eastern germany , skinheads and others attracted to the far-right are not in the minority .
for example , in local elections in saxony in 2004 , almost one out of every four first-time voters chose the rightwing npd party .
one reason for the party 's good performance in the elections is that it provides jobs to the young . the club , culture on the road , is trying to take on and embrace the diversity of youth culture .
it does n't matter whether it is punk , hip hop or black metal - anything is better than the right fringe .
the club offers information , holds discussions and workshops keeping in mind , the style , music and political background of the diverse youth movements . a record as a tool it is dj training class at a special school for the learning-disabled in blankenhain in the eastern german state of thuringia .
and instead of math homework , the students sit curious before two turntables .
peer wiechmann shows the students how to lay a record down and find the right beat . " you take your hand and lay the record , here and there , " he tells the kids .
" at first , try to be relatively even so that you produce a real beat .
and after you feel more secure , try and lay another down and get another beat to overlay on the first . " everyone gets a change to try it .
bastian , 14 , is really getting into it .
" it is really interesting to do it yourself , " he said .
" and also to get tips and learn something new from someone with experience . weichmann answers all the kids questions , shows tricks .
but he also knows that he is no dj . youth culture is tolerant wiechmann comes from the weimar-based network against rightwing extremism who issued the contract for the event .
afterward , he picked up his team in berlin on the way to blankenhain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project aims to engage young people in meaninful discussions " we have a strong sense of camaraderie and commitment , " he said .
" and we try to capture the children through music and dance .
youth culture is essentially by its nature tolerant , diverse and international .
that is what we communicate and everyone seems to like that . " culture on the road is a colourful team of 15 young people .
several members of the group have studied political science and are especially familiar with right-wing extremist ideology .
others come from different youth scenes such as hip hop , techno or metal .
an american member of the group played in a punk band for years .
she offers day-long workshops with music . in the east , hating foreigners is normal silke baer is responsible for the concept .
she wants with the project above all to reach those young people in the new eastern german states , where she says that the group has learned through experience that " seeing foreigners as the enemy is an absolutely normal thing . " " we go into this region and talk with kids about youth culture through political discussions , " she said .
" in this way , we try to bring them closer into the democratic fold . " that most youth culture comes from abroad is one point , she says .
another is the history of such movements .
for example , hardly any kids know that the punk movement of the 1970s arose out of the high unemployment in the younger ranks in the uk .
this is something that baer knows only too well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : culture is one way to reach those hard-to-reach young people sociologist michaela glaser from the german youth institute in halle says that these types of youth projects are indispensable . " the important thing is that there is first access to the young in order to be able to work with them , " she said .
" and it is just these projects , in our experience , that help the young become more open and be ready for future conflicts . " not a one-time thing and it is also important to be consistent and not have such projects be a one-time occurrence otherwise they will be in vain , said glaser .
that is a danger in many communities with empty cash registers who have already stricken youth programs from their tight budgets . corinna hundshagen , the director of the blankenhain school says that her staff wants to remain on the ball . " i have already spoken to peer weichmann and requested that at the very least , he should remain in contact , " she said .

" i could have gotten on a plane and rushed over and starting shuttling around and it would n't have been clear what i was shuttling to do , " rice said on friday . what she will not do , is accept rising demands from european and arab states for an immediate ceasefire in israel 's battle against hezbollah , regarding such a step as a " false promise " bound to simply incubate future conflicts . washington argues a ceasefire can come only as part of a diplomatic package that sees the disarmament of hezbollah , guarantees of israeli security at its northern border and an end to syrian and iranian backing of hezbollah . " secretary rice will make it clear that resolving the crisis demands confronting the terrorist group that launched the attacks and the nations that support it , " president george w. bush said saturday in his weekly radio address . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice is backed by her boss but faces widespread suspicion washington is taking a broad strategic view of the conflict , sparked when hezbollah abducted two israeli soldiers . it is therefore difficult to see the united states settling for any resolution in which hezbollah , syria and iran are not seen to have suffered a defeat . stalwart ally faltering but the us position appears to becoming increasingly lonely .
faithful us ally britain saturday criticized israel 's tactics , and even took a swipe at american strategy . the british junior foreign minister , kim howells , said in beirut : " i very much hope that the americans understand what 's happening to lebanon - the destruction of the infrastructure , the death of so many children and so many people . " rice will meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert and also see palestinian president mahmud abbas after arriving on monday . in rome , on wednesday , she will face desperate lebanese leaders , un officials and europeans demanding a ceasefire and arab allies who reportedly refused to host her visit , dismayed at us strategy . but some analysts said qualified progress remained possible . hopes for ceasefire follow rice " i do n't think the secretary of state would be going to the region unless they were fairly sure that she could accomplish something , " said steven cook , of the council on foreign relations .

" i think what we 're all looking for now is to get beyond the rock , paper , scissors dynamic , " said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity . the talks have " so many moving parts " that everyone needs to shift at the same time to keep the machine moving forward , said the official . the geneva gathering , behind closed doors at the us mission in geneva , is scheduled to continue monday and be followed by further talks on july 28-29 . it comes in the wake of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit of leading powers in saint petersburg , russia . hopes for conclusion by year-end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 wants a resolution in the doha round talks the g8 , which comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states , and russia which is not a wto member , on july 16 had said that negotiators must within weeks thrash out the broad outlines of a deal and help steer the doha round to its conclusion by the end of the year . the following day , g8 leaders joined forces with counterparts from brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa to try to spur the doha round on . the negotiations began in capital of qatar in 2001 with the aim of producing an international treaty that would tear down trade barriers such as subsidies and customs duties and enable trade to improve living standards in developing countries . the round was meant to end in 2004 .
that target was later shifted to december 2006 because of persistent breakdowns . the talks have swung back and forth from collapse to revival , leaving behind a string of missed deadlines . rumors of a deal a so-called crunch session at the beginning of this month fizzled out without a breakthrough .
but rumors have been flying since the g8 summit that , behind closed doors , the leaders cut a deal to end the doha deadlock . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush offered deep subsidy cuts it has been suggested that us president george w. bush offered deeper cuts in washington 's farm subsidies , which according to critics skew trade in favor of agribusiness in the united states . in october , in what it billed as a bold move to jumpstart the doha round , washington offered to slash its payouts by 53 percent . other wto members were and are still unhappy , saying the proposal lacks bite and would leave the us room to spend around $ 22 billion - more than current payouts . there have been claims that during the g8 , bush offered to set a ceiling of $ 15 billion .
but several trade diplomats have dismissed the suggestion that the g8 leaders talked figures , with one saying it is based on " very wishful thinking . " deeper cuts would be a tough sell domestically for the us leader ahead of crucial mid-term elections in november . developing countries , meanwhile , also want the eu to reduce its customs duties on imports of agricultural goods . eu ready to bargain over tariffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson at the wto talks last month , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said that if others made the right moves , the eu was prepared to step " towards and close to " the 54-percent tariff cut demanded by brazil and india , which steer the powerful g20 lobby of developing countries . the current eu proposal is 39 percent , although eu officials have said brussels could accept 51 percent .

" we can not allow extremist forces to define the agenda of the middle east , " steinmeier said .
" we must strive to stop extremist forces from wanting to broaden the scope of the conflict , " he said . " we are making all efforts to create the suitable conditions which will allow for a ceasefire , within a political framework aimed at reaching permanent stability in the region , " steinmeier said . israel launched its massive offensive on lebanon after the lebanese shiite group hezbollah captured two israeli soldiers in a border region on july 12 with the aim of securing a prisoner exchange . in 11 days , the conflict has killed more than 340 people in lebanon , more than 30 in israel , and forced upwards of half a million lebanese to flee their homes . complex ceasefire conditions but for his part abul gheit insisted that a prisoner swap should be part of these conditions and stressed the need for a ceasefire .
" a ceasefire is a principal and essential demand which we must concentrate on , " he said .
" reaching stability for a ceasefire must go hand in hand with certain procedures , including the swap . " israel has around 10,000 palestinian prisoners and an unknown number of lebanese in its jails .
hezbollah , like palestinian groups which snatched another soldier on june 25 , have demanded a prisoner swap with israel . germany and russia are trying to help israel secure the release of its soldiers in lebanon and the gaza strip , the german newspaper berliner zeitung reported on friday . the newspaper said the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- is trying to use its contacts within the two groups .

it is time for germany to do so again , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said thursday . steinmeier was just one of a number of top diplomats from europe who planned to converge on israel sunday ahead of a visit by us secretary of state condoleezza rice as world powers moved to try to end the lebanon conflict . european diplomatic frenzy the europeans are trying to push the jewish state into ending its massive blitz on lebanon , which has killed more than 350 people in 12 days , most of them civilians , and destroyed key infrastructure across the country . washington , israel 's closest ally , continues to staunchly defend the jewish state and argues that a ceasefire can only come as part of a wider diplomatic package involving the disarmament of the lebanese shiite muslim hezbollah . french foreign minister phillipe douste-blazy visited the northern city of haifa , which was hit again sunday by deadly rocket fire from hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste- blazy will meet israeli prime minister olmert douste-blazy was due to meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert later in the day , along with foreign minister tzipi livni , and palestinian president mahmud abbas in the west bank . " i am convinced that a ceasefire is possible , " douste-blazy said europeans face israel 's tough stance israel has rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire in its war against hezbollah .
" it 's too early to talk about a ceasefire , " immigration minister zeev boim said before a weekly cabinet meeting .
" we first have to reach the goals which we set , to rout hezbollah from southern lebanon . " olmert was also due to meet with german foreign minister steinmeier . britain 's junior foreign minister kim howells , due to meet livni and abbas on sunday , was also likely to push israel into easing its offensive that has also displaced more than a half million people and triggered warnings of a humanitarian catastrophe . the european diplomatic efforts are unlikely to succeed until the united states changes its position and also presses for a cessation in hostilities . washington argues that a ceasefire can come only as part of a diplomatic package that sees the disarmament of hezbollah , guarantees of israeli security on its northern border and an end to syrian and iranian backing of hezbollah . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign governments issue final evacuation orders in lebanon foreign governments stepped up efforts to evacuate their remaining nationals from lebanon on saturday amid mounting talk of an israeli ground offensive against its northern neighbor .

" we can not allow extremist forces to define the agenda of the middle east , " steinmeier said .
" we must strive to stop extremist forces from wanting to broaden the scope of the conflict , " he said . " we are making all efforts to create the suitable conditions which will allow for a ceasefire , within a political framework aimed at reaching permanent stability in the region , " steinmeier said . israel launched its massive offensive on lebanon after the lebanese shiite group hezbollah captured two israeli soldiers in a border region on july 12 with the aim of securing a prisoner exchange . in 11 days , the conflict has killed more than 340 people in lebanon , more than 30 in israel , and forced upwards of half a million lebanese to flee their homes . complex ceasefire conditions but for his part abul gheit insisted that a prisoner swap should be part of these conditions and stressed the need for a ceasefire .
" a ceasefire is a principal and essential demand which we must concentrate on , " he said .
" reaching stability for a ceasefire must go hand in hand with certain procedures , including the swap . " israel has around 10,000 palestinian prisoners and an unknown number of lebanese in its jails .
hezbollah , like palestinian groups which snatched another soldier on june 25 , have demanded a prisoner swap with israel . germany and russia are trying to help israel secure the release of its soldiers in lebanon and the gaza strip , the german newspaper berliner zeitung reported on friday . the newspaper said the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- is trying to use its contacts within the two groups .

it is time for germany to do so again , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said thursday . steinmeier was just one of a number of top diplomats from europe who planned to converge on israel sunday ahead of a visit by us secretary of state condoleezza rice as world powers moved to try to end the lebanon conflict . european diplomatic frenzy the europeans are trying to push the jewish state into ending its massive blitz on lebanon , which has killed more than 350 people in 12 days , most of them civilians , and destroyed key infrastructure across the country . washington , israel 's closest ally , continues to staunchly defend the jewish state and argues that a ceasefire can only come as part of a wider diplomatic package involving the disarmament of the lebanese shiite muslim hezbollah . french foreign minister phillipe douste-blazy visited the northern city of haifa , which was hit again sunday by deadly rocket fire from hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste- blazy will meet israeli prime minister olmert douste-blazy was due to meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert later in the day , along with foreign minister tzipi livni , and palestinian president mahmud abbas in the west bank . " i am convinced that a ceasefire is possible , " douste-blazy said europeans face israel 's tough stance israel has rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire in its war against hezbollah .
" it 's too early to talk about a ceasefire , " immigration minister zeev boim said before a weekly cabinet meeting .
" we first have to reach the goals which we set , to rout hezbollah from southern lebanon . " olmert was also due to meet with german foreign minister steinmeier . britain 's junior foreign minister kim howells , due to meet livni and abbas on sunday , was also likely to push israel into easing its offensive that has also displaced more than a half million people and triggered warnings of a humanitarian catastrophe . the european diplomatic efforts are unlikely to succeed until the united states changes its position and also presses for a cessation in hostilities . washington argues that a ceasefire can come only as part of a diplomatic package that sees the disarmament of hezbollah , guarantees of israeli security on its northern border and an end to syrian and iranian backing of hezbollah . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign governments issue final evacuation orders in lebanon foreign governments stepped up efforts to evacuate their remaining nationals from lebanon on saturday amid mounting talk of an israeli ground offensive against its northern neighbor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sounds like germany krautrock created a new sound for a new generation german rap keeps it real mozart classic gets street treatment in berlin update happy birthday , herbert grönemeyer ! culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.07.2006 the man behind the pianist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz mohr has always been more than a mere piano technician after a career tuning pianos for horowitz , gould and others , franz mohr knows what makes a good piano - and pianist .
he talked with dw-world.de about his career as steinway & sons chief piano technician . franz mohr has a way of endearing himself to everyone he comes into contact with .
in his 30-year career as a piano technician for piano greats like vladimir horowitz , arthur rubenstein and glenn gould , mohr became more than just a highly valued tuner : he was also a friend and confident to the pianists he worked with . this was part of the success he had as steinway 's chief piano technician - a job that meant tempering not only grand pianos , but also dealing with the often unpredictable temperaments of the world famous artists who performed on them . 79-year-old mohr is a native of düren , germany , where he and his parents miraculously survived severe allied bombings in 1944 .
after training to be a piano technician in germany , he immigrated to new york in 1962 to accept a job with steinway & sons .
three years later , he became the piano maker 's chief piano technician , a role he took over from legendary tuner bill hupfer . dw-world.de : mr. mohr , how did your relationship to music begin ? franz mohr : i grew up with music .
i went to the hochschule für musik in cologne where i studied the violin .
then i developed tremendous physical problems with my left wrist .
it was terrible .
i had to take breaks and visited all kinds of doctors and finally had to come to the very painful decision that i could n't become a performing artist but had to do something else with my life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classic i saw an ad in a german music magazine that rudolf ibach sohn - the oldest piano manufacturing company in germany , founded in 1774 - was looking for apprentices .
i was already 24 years old at that time , but i thought , this also has something to do with music - why do n't i try it ?
they accepted me and i just loved working with my hands and learning about all the phases of piano building . the ultimate dream in the music world - at least as a piano technician - is steinway .
around 1954 , i applied for a job as a concert piano tuner for a concert management company in duesseldorf , which was also a steinway dealer .
and i got the job !
for the first time , i started to work on steinways and i really fell in love with them , both as a technician and as a musician . what is special about steinway pianos ? not only the design of a the piano , but also the quality of wood which goes into the piano are very important - especially when it comes to the sound board .
with this quality of wood you have a tremendously wide spectrum of tone colors . all the other instruments are mass produced , including yamaha - nothing against yamaha , but they build over 800 pianos a day and they have to use any kind of wood they come across .
their soundboard is , for instance , much thicker .
that counts for brilliance , which you need in any piano , but nothing else .
you play a pianissimo and it 's still too loud . we build steinways in two factories , in hamburg and new york , and we build 13 pianos a day .
that is the difference .
a steinway piano gets better and better all the time because of the quality of wood we use . in 1962 , you accepted a job as a piano technician with steinway & sons in new york .
did you have any difficulties adjusting to american culture when you came ? no , of course not .
we fell in love with america .
let me tell you a story : i 'd worked for many great artists in germany and had tuned for rudolf serkin there and in america .
the first thing he said to me when i visited him in vermont to work on his three concert grand pianos was , " franz , now we are in america where things are not so complicated .
now you can call me rudy . "
until that time he had always been " herr professor " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir horowitz when your predecessor bill hupfer retired in 1965 you took his position as chief piano technician .
at that point , you began working with vladimir horowitz , who you toured with and tuned for until his sudden death in 1989 .
what was horowitz like as a person ? of course , he was difficult and had a very complex personality .
you never knew when he would blow up and scream and whatever .
it took a long time before we really became such good friends .
many times before a concert he would say , " franz , you are the most important person here ! " horowitz was an accomplished steinway artist in russia when he was 19 years old .
when he ran away from russia " with a thousand rubles in his shoes " , as he always said , he came to berlin .
and immediately all the german piano companies - bösendorf , bechstein , blühtner - they all wanted him to try their pianos so he would play their product .
he tried them all , but there was never any doubt in his mind about steinway . after his death , i still traveled with his piano .
we will take the horowitz piano to japan soon and i 'm going with the piano . who else played horowitz 's piano ? in his lifetime , only one person .
that was murray perahia .
he was flabbergasted , of course , that horowitz let him play it .
but after the first piece he came back and said , " franz , i 'm sorry but i can not handle it . " each steinway is different - it feels different and sound different .
and each artist has different requirements .
horowitz died and we wanted to send the piano on tour .
but i was so afraid : who would be able to manage that piano ?
i did have to change a few things , but people just love it . what was it like to tour with horowitz ? it was wonderful !
horowitz only played on sundays and the rehearsals were always saturdays and the rest of the week i could go sightseeing .
he said , " franz bring your wife and your children , i 'll pay . "
i knew exactly what he wanted in the piano and it was a wonderful relationship - i was part of the family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glenn gould as soon as you arrived in the us in 1962 , you had the chance to work with glenn gould , who was known for being somewhat eccentric .
how did you get along with him ? my predecessor , bill hupfer , had recording session at the famous 30th street columbia record studio where he tuned for glenn gould .
he fell into disgrace with glenn gould and i had been in america for just a few days . bill should have known better : he went to glenn just before the recording session , put his hand on his shoulder , and asked him how he was doing .
later glenn claimed his shoulder had been dislocated because the tuner had slapped him on the shoulder , which was n't true .
he had to cancel concerts and had a lawsuit with steinway . bill could n't tune for him anymore , so i was sent by steinway to take care of glenn gould .
over the years we became very good friends .
i went nearly every month to toronto to do his recording in the later years .
he knew that i would come to toronto with rubenstein or horowitz or serkin and he would never go to anyone 's concert .
but he knew that i was coming and he would pick me up at the airport and make sure we spent the evening together , listening to recordings and talking . you know so many of the top pianists from the 20th century - both musically and personally .
do you see any patterns ?
what makes them great ? in german we call it " ausstrahlung " - a presence , a communication from the stage to the people , which many people do not have .
if you have this , it does n't even matter if you play a lot of wrong notes .
of course , rubenstein , horowitz and serkin had this . franz mohr lives in new york and , though nearing 80 , he still travels regularly as a piano technician , teacher and lecturer .
he currently tours with italian pianist mauricio pollini .
mohr 's book , " my life with the great pianists " , has been translated into seven languages and is available at most online bookstores . kate bowen interviewed franz mohr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart : a pop icon with staying power from his beginnings as a child prodigy under the thumb of a demanding father to later year-long tours and an extravagant lifestyle , mozart set the pop star bar high , even for today 's standards .

he talked with dw-world.de about his career as steinway & sons chief piano technician . franz mohr has a way of endearing himself to everyone he comes into contact with .
in his 30-year career as a piano technician for piano greats like vladimir horowitz , arthur rubenstein and glenn gould , mohr became more than just a highly valued tuner : he was also a friend and confident to the pianists he worked with . this was part of the success he had as steinway 's chief piano technician - a job that meant tempering not only grand pianos , but also dealing with the often unpredictable temperaments of the world famous artists who performed on them . 79-year-old mohr is a native of düren , germany , where he and his parents miraculously survived severe allied bombings in 1944 .
after training to be a piano technician in germany , he immigrated to new york in 1962 to accept a job with steinway & sons .
three years later , he became the piano maker 's chief piano technician , a role he took over from legendary tuner bill hupfer . dw-world.de : mr. mohr , how did your relationship to music begin ? franz mohr : i grew up with music .
i went to the hochschule für musik in cologne where i studied the violin .
then i developed tremendous physical problems with my left wrist .
it was terrible .
i had to take breaks and visited all kinds of doctors and finally had to come to the very painful decision that i could n't become a performing artist but had to do something else with my life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classic i saw an ad in a german music magazine that rudolf ibach sohn - the oldest piano manufacturing company in germany , founded in 1774 - was looking for apprentices .
i was already 24 years old at that time , but i thought , this also has something to do with music - why do n't i try it ?
they accepted me and i just loved working with my hands and learning about all the phases of piano building . the ultimate dream in the music world - at least as a piano technician - is steinway .
around 1954 , i applied for a job as a concert piano tuner for a concert management company in duesseldorf , which was also a steinway dealer .
and i got the job !
for the first time , i started to work on steinways and i really fell in love with them , both as a technician and as a musician . what is special about steinway pianos ? not only the design of a the piano , but also the quality of wood which goes into the piano are very important - especially when it comes to the sound board .
with this quality of wood you have a tremendously wide spectrum of tone colors . all the other instruments are mass produced , including yamaha - nothing against yamaha , but they build over 800 pianos a day and they have to use any kind of wood they come across .
their soundboard is , for instance , much thicker .
that counts for brilliance , which you need in any piano , but nothing else .
you play a pianissimo and it 's still too loud . we build steinways in two factories , in hamburg and new york , and we build 13 pianos a day .
that is the difference .
a steinway piano gets better and better all the time because of the quality of wood we use . in 1962 , you accepted a job as a piano technician with steinway & sons in new york .
did you have any difficulties adjusting to american culture when you came ? no , of course not .
we fell in love with america .
let me tell you a story : i 'd worked for many great artists in germany and had tuned for rudolf serkin there and in america .
the first thing he said to me when i visited him in vermont to work on his three concert grand pianos was , " franz , now we are in america where things are not so complicated .
now you can call me rudy . "
until that time he had always been " herr professor " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir horowitz when your predecessor bill hupfer retired in 1965 you took his position as chief piano technician .
at that point , you began working with vladimir horowitz , who you toured with and tuned for until his sudden death in 1989 .
what was horowitz like as a person ? of course , he was difficult and had a very complex personality .
you never knew when he would blow up and scream and whatever .
it took a long time before we really became such good friends .
many times before a concert he would say , " franz , you are the most important person here ! " horowitz was an accomplished steinway artist in russia when he was 19 years old .
when he ran away from russia " with a thousand rubles in his shoes " , as he always said , he came to berlin .
and immediately all the german piano companies - bösendorf , bechstein , blühtner - they all wanted him to try their pianos so he would play their product .
he tried them all , but there was never any doubt in his mind about steinway . after his death , i still traveled with his piano .
we will take the horowitz piano to japan soon and i 'm going with the piano . who else played horowitz 's piano ? in his lifetime , only one person .
that was murray perahia .
he was flabbergasted , of course , that horowitz let him play it .
but after the first piece he came back and said , " franz , i 'm sorry but i can not handle it . " each steinway is different - it feels different and sound different .
and each artist has different requirements .
horowitz died and we wanted to send the piano on tour .
but i was so afraid : who would be able to manage that piano ?
i did have to change a few things , but people just love it . what was it like to tour with horowitz ? it was wonderful !
horowitz only played on sundays and the rehearsals were always saturdays and the rest of the week i could go sightseeing .
he said , " franz bring your wife and your children , i 'll pay . "
i knew exactly what he wanted in the piano and it was a wonderful relationship - i was part of the family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glenn gould as soon as you arrived in the us in 1962 , you had the chance to work with glenn gould , who was known for being somewhat eccentric .
how did you get along with him ? my predecessor , bill hupfer , had recording session at the famous 30th street columbia record studio where he tuned for glenn gould .
he fell into disgrace with glenn gould and i had been in america for just a few days . bill should have known better : he went to glenn just before the recording session , put his hand on his shoulder , and asked him how he was doing .
later glenn claimed his shoulder had been dislocated because the tuner had slapped him on the shoulder , which was n't true .
he had to cancel concerts and had a lawsuit with steinway . bill could n't tune for him anymore , so i was sent by steinway to take care of glenn gould .
over the years we became very good friends .
i went nearly every month to toronto to do his recording in the later years .
he knew that i would come to toronto with rubenstein or horowitz or serkin and he would never go to anyone 's concert .
but he knew that i was coming and he would pick me up at the airport and make sure we spent the evening together , listening to recordings and talking . you know so many of the top pianists from the 20th century - both musically and personally .
do you see any patterns ?
what makes them great ? in german we call it " ausstrahlung " - a presence , a communication from the stage to the people , which many people do not have .
if you have this , it does n't even matter if you play a lot of wrong notes .
of course , rubenstein , horowitz and serkin had this . franz mohr lives in new york and , though nearing 80 , he still travels regularly as a piano technician , teacher and lecturer .
he currently tours with italian pianist mauricio pollini .
mohr 's book , " my life with the great pianists " , has been translated into seven languages and is available at most online bookstores . kate bowen interviewed franz mohr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart : a pop icon with staying power from his beginnings as a child prodigy under the thumb of a demanding father to later year-long tours and an extravagant lifestyle , mozart set the pop star bar high , even for today 's standards .

" i think what we 're all looking for now is to get beyond the rock , paper , scissors dynamic , " said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity . the talks have " so many moving parts " that everyone needs to shift at the same time to keep the machine moving forward , said the official . the geneva gathering , behind closed doors at the us mission in geneva , is scheduled to continue monday and be followed by further talks on july 28-29 . it comes in the wake of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit of leading powers in saint petersburg , russia . hopes for conclusion by year-end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 wants a resolution in the doha round talks the g8 , which comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states , and russia which is not a wto member , on july 16 had said that negotiators must within weeks thrash out the broad outlines of a deal and help steer the doha round to its conclusion by the end of the year . the following day , g8 leaders joined forces with counterparts from brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa to try to spur the doha round on . the negotiations began in capital of qatar in 2001 with the aim of producing an international treaty that would tear down trade barriers such as subsidies and customs duties and enable trade to improve living standards in developing countries . the round was meant to end in 2004 .
that target was later shifted to december 2006 because of persistent breakdowns . the talks have swung back and forth from collapse to revival , leaving behind a string of missed deadlines . rumors of a deal a so-called crunch session at the beginning of this month fizzled out without a breakthrough .
but rumors have been flying since the g8 summit that , behind closed doors , the leaders cut a deal to end the doha deadlock . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush offered deep subsidy cuts it has been suggested that us president george w. bush offered deeper cuts in washington 's farm subsidies , which according to critics skew trade in favor of agribusiness in the united states . in october , in what it billed as a bold move to jumpstart the doha round , washington offered to slash its payouts by 53 percent . other wto members were and are still unhappy , saying the proposal lacks bite and would leave the us room to spend around $ 22 billion - more than current payouts . there have been claims that during the g8 , bush offered to set a ceiling of $ 15 billion .
but several trade diplomats have dismissed the suggestion that the g8 leaders talked figures , with one saying it is based on " very wishful thinking . " deeper cuts would be a tough sell domestically for the us leader ahead of crucial mid-term elections in november . developing countries , meanwhile , also want the eu to reduce its customs duties on imports of agricultural goods . eu ready to bargain over tariffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson at the wto talks last month , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said that if others made the right moves , the eu was prepared to step " towards and close to " the 54-percent tariff cut demanded by brazil and india , which steer the powerful g20 lobby of developing countries . the current eu proposal is 39 percent , although eu officials have said brussels could accept 51 percent .
" if we are going to move towards the g20 figures on tariffs - and we 're prepared to do that - the us is going to have to do the same on subsidies , " said an eu diplomat . washington and brussels agree on one thing : they want more concessions from the developing world on trade in services and manufactured goods . the specific target for the upcoming wto meetings is a deal on " modalities " - wto jargon for the mathematics for cutting subsidies and customs duties - a key step towards a final treaty . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 leaders end summit with focus on trade the leaders of the group of eight ended their three-day summit in russia with a push to salvage global free-trade talks that are teetering on the verge of collapse .

" i think what we 're all looking for now is to get beyond the rock , paper , scissors dynamic , " said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity . the talks have " so many moving parts " that everyone needs to shift at the same time to keep the machine moving forward , said the official . the geneva gathering , behind closed doors at the us mission in geneva , is scheduled to continue monday and be followed by further talks on july 28-29 . it comes in the wake of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit of leading powers in saint petersburg , russia . hopes for conclusion by year-end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 wants a resolution in the doha round talks the g8 , which comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states , and russia which is not a wto member , on july 16 had said that negotiators must within weeks thrash out the broad outlines of a deal and help steer the doha round to its conclusion by the end of the year . the following day , g8 leaders joined forces with counterparts from brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa to try to spur the doha round on . the negotiations began in capital of qatar in 2001 with the aim of producing an international treaty that would tear down trade barriers such as subsidies and customs duties and enable trade to improve living standards in developing countries . the round was meant to end in 2004 .
that target was later shifted to december 2006 because of persistent breakdowns . the talks have swung back and forth from collapse to revival , leaving behind a string of missed deadlines . rumors of a deal a so-called crunch session at the beginning of this month fizzled out without a breakthrough .
but rumors have been flying since the g8 summit that , behind closed doors , the leaders cut a deal to end the doha deadlock . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush offered deep subsidy cuts it has been suggested that us president george w. bush offered deeper cuts in washington 's farm subsidies , which according to critics skew trade in favor of agribusiness in the united states . in october , in what it billed as a bold move to jumpstart the doha round , washington offered to slash its payouts by 53 percent . other wto members were and are still unhappy , saying the proposal lacks bite and would leave the us room to spend around $ 22 billion - more than current payouts . there have been claims that during the g8 , bush offered to set a ceiling of $ 15 billion .
but several trade diplomats have dismissed the suggestion that the g8 leaders talked figures , with one saying it is based on " very wishful thinking . " deeper cuts would be a tough sell domestically for the us leader ahead of crucial mid-term elections in november . developing countries , meanwhile , also want the eu to reduce its customs duties on imports of agricultural goods . eu ready to bargain over tariffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson at the wto talks last month , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said that if others made the right moves , the eu was prepared to step " towards and close to " the 54-percent tariff cut demanded by brazil and india , which steer the powerful g20 lobby of developing countries . the current eu proposal is 39 percent , although eu officials have said brussels could accept 51 percent .
" if we are going to move towards the g20 figures on tariffs - and we 're prepared to do that - the us is going to have to do the same on subsidies , " said an eu diplomat . washington and brussels agree on one thing : they want more concessions from the developing world on trade in services and manufactured goods . the specific target for the upcoming wto meetings is a deal on " modalities " - wto jargon for the mathematics for cutting subsidies and customs duties - a key step towards a final treaty . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 leaders end summit with focus on trade the leaders of the group of eight ended their three-day summit in russia with a push to salvage global free-trade talks that are teetering on the verge of collapse .

there 's not much time left , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most young ethnic germans came to germany after 1990 and attended language classes german " language islands , " meaning that the language was spoken in several nearby villages , " are no longer there , " said nina berend , a linguists who grew up in siberia and now lives in germany .
berend added that most people left after the fall of communism . " they have emigrated to germany , " she said . as a result , german dialects are rapidly disappearing .
linguist alfred wildfeuer said that some dialects wo n't be spoken in ukraine any more in the near future . " the youngest speaker of bohemian german that we encountered was 45 , " he said .
" it seems like that there are almost no children , who grow up with this dialect . " presenting a modern view of germany germany 's cultural institute , the goethe institute , is trying to preserve the dialects .
it offers language courses for those that no longer speak german as well as cultural events that are meant to offer a current view of germany to people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to modern germany than brass ensembles but ethnic germans in russia , kazakhstan and ukraine not only speak old dialects - they are also attached to an antiquated view of germany . " they are mainly interested in folklore , national costumes and flags , " said werner jost , who works for the goethe institute .
" they care about dances , songs and similar things that help them find their identity .
we do n't think that 's enough .
we think that identity that has a future is something else and try to guide them there . " learning to profit from bilingual skills living between two cultures and languages is almost always very difficult for people .
eleonara hummel , a writer , spent her youth in kazakhstan and later moved to dresden with her parents .
her work is now influenced by the experience of growing up in two different worlds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden has few similarities with cities in kazakhstan " i 've learned to appreciate the fact that i can draw from a fund that not everyone has , " she said .
" it took a while to get to this point .
only in the last couple of years , i 've stopped thinking : ' why could i not have been someone else ? '
i 've accepted it and am content . " only few people manage to see their ability to speak german as a chance while living in russia , ukraine or kazakhstan .
but some are now profiting from their bilingual skills . " an austrian ski producer has a factory in ukraine , " wildfeuer said .

he talked with dw-world.de about his career as steinway & sons chief piano technician . franz mohr has a way of endearing himself to everyone he comes into contact with .
in his 30-year career as a piano technician for piano greats like vladimir horowitz , arthur rubenstein and glenn gould , mohr became more than just a highly valued tuner : he was also a friend and confident to the pianists he worked with . this was part of the success he had as steinway 's chief piano technician - a job that meant tempering not only grand pianos , but also dealing with the often unpredictable temperaments of the world famous artists who performed on them . 79-year-old mohr is a native of düren , germany , where he and his parents miraculously survived severe allied bombings in 1944 .
after training to be a piano technician in germany , he immigrated to new york in 1962 to accept a job with steinway & sons .
three years later , he became the piano maker 's chief piano technician , a role he took over from legendary tuner bill hupfer . dw-world.de : mr. mohr , how did your relationship to music begin ? franz mohr : i grew up with music .
i went to the hochschule für musik in cologne where i studied the violin .
then i developed tremendous physical problems with my left wrist .
it was terrible .
i had to take breaks and visited all kinds of doctors and finally had to come to the very painful decision that i could n't become a performing artist but had to do something else with my life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classic i saw an ad in a german music magazine that rudolf ibach sohn - the oldest piano manufacturing company in germany , founded in 1774 - was looking for apprentices .
i was already 24 years old at that time , but i thought , this also has something to do with music - why do n't i try it ?
they accepted me and i just loved working with my hands and learning about all the phases of piano building . the ultimate dream in the music world - at least as a piano technician - is steinway .
around 1954 , i applied for a job as a concert piano tuner for a concert management company in duesseldorf , which was also a steinway dealer .
and i got the job !
for the first time , i started to work on steinways and i really fell in love with them , both as a technician and as a musician . what is special about steinway pianos ? not only the design of a the piano , but also the quality of wood which goes into the piano are very important - especially when it comes to the sound board .
with this quality of wood you have a tremendously wide spectrum of tone colors . all the other instruments are mass produced , including yamaha - nothing against yamaha , but they build over 800 pianos a day and they have to use any kind of wood they come across .
their soundboard is , for instance , much thicker .
that counts for brilliance , which you need in any piano , but nothing else .
you play a pianissimo and it 's still too loud . we build steinways in two factories , in hamburg and new york , and we build 13 pianos a day .
that is the difference .
a steinway piano gets better and better all the time because of the quality of wood we use . in 1962 , you accepted a job as a piano technician with steinway & sons in new york .
did you have any difficulties adjusting to american culture when you came ? no , of course not .
we fell in love with america .
let me tell you a story : i 'd worked for many great artists in germany and had tuned for rudolf serkin there and in america .
the first thing he said to me when i visited him in vermont to work on his three concert grand pianos was , " franz , now we are in america where things are not so complicated .
now you can call me rudy . "
until that time he had always been " herr professor " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir horowitz when your predecessor bill hupfer retired in 1965 you took his position as chief piano technician .
at that point , you began working with vladimir horowitz , who you toured with and tuned for until his sudden death in 1989 .
what was horowitz like as a person ? of course , he was difficult and had a very complex personality .
you never knew when he would blow up and scream and whatever .
it took a long time before we really became such good friends .
many times before a concert he would say , " franz , you are the most important person here ! " horowitz was an accomplished steinway artist in russia when he was 19 years old .
when he ran away from russia " with a thousand rubles in his shoes " , as he always said , he came to berlin .
and immediately all the german piano companies - bösendorf , bechstein , blühtner - they all wanted him to try their pianos so he would play their product .
he tried them all , but there was never any doubt in his mind about steinway . after his death , i still traveled with his piano .
we will take the horowitz piano to japan soon and i 'm going with the piano . who else played horowitz 's piano ? in his lifetime , only one person .
that was murray perahia .
he was flabbergasted , of course , that horowitz let him play it .
but after the first piece he came back and said , " franz , i 'm sorry but i can not handle it . " each steinway is different - it feels different and sound different .
and each artist has different requirements .
horowitz died and we wanted to send the piano on tour .
but i was so afraid : who would be able to manage that piano ?
i did have to change a few things , but people just love it . what was it like to tour with horowitz ? it was wonderful !
horowitz only played on sundays and the rehearsals were always saturdays and the rest of the week i could go sightseeing .
he said , " franz bring your wife and your children , i 'll pay . "
i knew exactly what he wanted in the piano and it was a wonderful relationship - i was part of the family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glenn gould as soon as you arrived in the us in 1962 , you had the chance to work with glenn gould , who was known for being somewhat eccentric .
how did you get along with him ? my predecessor , bill hupfer , had recording session at the famous 30th street columbia record studio where he tuned for glenn gould .
he fell into disgrace with glenn gould and i had been in america for just a few days . bill should have known better : he went to glenn just before the recording session , put his hand on his shoulder , and asked him how he was doing .
later glenn claimed his shoulder had been dislocated because the tuner had slapped him on the shoulder , which was n't true .
he had to cancel concerts and had a lawsuit with steinway . bill could n't tune for him anymore , so i was sent by steinway to take care of glenn gould .
over the years we became very good friends .
i went nearly every month to toronto to do his recording in the later years .
he knew that i would come to toronto with rubenstein or horowitz or serkin and he would never go to anyone 's concert .
but he knew that i was coming and he would pick me up at the airport and make sure we spent the evening together , listening to recordings and talking . you know so many of the top pianists from the 20th century - both musically and personally .
do you see any patterns ?
what makes them great ? in german we call it " ausstrahlung " - a presence , a communication from the stage to the people , which many people do not have .
if you have this , it does n't even matter if you play a lot of wrong notes .
of course , rubenstein , horowitz and serkin had this . franz mohr lives in new york and , though nearing 80 , he still travels regularly as a piano technician , teacher and lecturer .
he currently tours with italian pianist mauricio pollini .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sounds like germany krautrock created a new sound for a new generation german rap keeps it real mozart classic gets street treatment in berlin update happy birthday , herbert grönemeyer ! culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.07.2006 the man behind the pianist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz mohr has always been more than a mere piano technician after a career tuning pianos for horowitz , gould and others , franz mohr knows what makes a good piano - and pianist .
he talked with dw-world.de about his career as steinway & sons chief piano technician . franz mohr has a way of endearing himself to everyone he comes into contact with .
in his 30-year career as a piano technician for piano greats like vladimir horowitz , arthur rubenstein and glenn gould , mohr became more than just a highly valued tuner : he was also a friend and confident to the pianists he worked with . this was part of the success he had as steinway 's chief piano technician - a job that meant tempering not only grand pianos , but also dealing with the often unpredictable temperaments of the world famous artists who performed on them . 79-year-old mohr is a native of düren , germany , where he and his parents miraculously survived severe allied bombings in 1944 .
after training to be a piano technician in germany , he immigrated to new york in 1962 to accept a job with steinway & sons .
three years later , he became the piano maker 's chief piano technician , a role he took over from legendary tuner bill hupfer . dw-world.de : mr. mohr , how did your relationship to music begin ? franz mohr : i grew up with music .
i went to the hochschule für musik in cologne where i studied the violin .
then i developed tremendous physical problems with my left wrist .
it was terrible .
i had to take breaks and visited all kinds of doctors and finally had to come to the very painful decision that i could n't become a performing artist but had to do something else with my life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classic i saw an ad in a german music magazine that rudolf ibach sohn - the oldest piano manufacturing company in germany , founded in 1774 - was looking for apprentices .
i was already 24 years old at that time , but i thought , this also has something to do with music - why do n't i try it ?
they accepted me and i just loved working with my hands and learning about all the phases of piano building . the ultimate dream in the music world - at least as a piano technician - is steinway .
around 1954 , i applied for a job as a concert piano tuner for a concert management company in duesseldorf , which was also a steinway dealer .
and i got the job !
for the first time , i started to work on steinways and i really fell in love with them , both as a technician and as a musician . what is special about steinway pianos ? not only the design of a the piano , but also the quality of wood which goes into the piano are very important - especially when it comes to the sound board .
with this quality of wood you have a tremendously wide spectrum of tone colors . all the other instruments are mass produced , including yamaha - nothing against yamaha , but they build over 800 pianos a day and they have to use any kind of wood they come across .
their soundboard is , for instance , much thicker .
that counts for brilliance , which you need in any piano , but nothing else .
you play a pianissimo and it 's still too loud . we build steinways in two factories , in hamburg and new york , and we build 13 pianos a day .
that is the difference .
a steinway piano gets better and better all the time because of the quality of wood we use . in 1962 , you accepted a job as a piano technician with steinway & sons in new york .
did you have any difficulties adjusting to american culture when you came ? no , of course not .
we fell in love with america .
let me tell you a story : i 'd worked for many great artists in germany and had tuned for rudolf serkin there and in america .
the first thing he said to me when i visited him in vermont to work on his three concert grand pianos was , " franz , now we are in america where things are not so complicated .
now you can call me rudy . "
until that time he had always been " herr professor " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir horowitz when your predecessor bill hupfer retired in 1965 you took his position as chief piano technician .
at that point , you began working with vladimir horowitz , who you toured with and tuned for until his sudden death in 1989 .
what was horowitz like as a person ? of course , he was difficult and had a very complex personality .
you never knew when he would blow up and scream and whatever .
it took a long time before we really became such good friends .
many times before a concert he would say , " franz , you are the most important person here ! " horowitz was an accomplished steinway artist in russia when he was 19 years old .
when he ran away from russia " with a thousand rubles in his shoes " , as he always said , he came to berlin .
and immediately all the german piano companies - bösendorf , bechstein , blühtner - they all wanted him to try their pianos so he would play their product .
he tried them all , but there was never any doubt in his mind about steinway . after his death , i still traveled with his piano .
we will take the horowitz piano to japan soon and i 'm going with the piano . who else played horowitz 's piano ? in his lifetime , only one person .
that was murray perahia .
he was flabbergasted , of course , that horowitz let him play it .
but after the first piece he came back and said , " franz , i 'm sorry but i can not handle it . " each steinway is different - it feels different and sound different .
and each artist has different requirements .
horowitz died and we wanted to send the piano on tour .
but i was so afraid : who would be able to manage that piano ?
i did have to change a few things , but people just love it . what was it like to tour with horowitz ? it was wonderful !
horowitz only played on sundays and the rehearsals were always saturdays and the rest of the week i could go sightseeing .
he said , " franz bring your wife and your children , i 'll pay . "
i knew exactly what he wanted in the piano and it was a wonderful relationship - i was part of the family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glenn gould as soon as you arrived in the us in 1962 , you had the chance to work with glenn gould , who was known for being somewhat eccentric .
how did you get along with him ? my predecessor , bill hupfer , had recording session at the famous 30th street columbia record studio where he tuned for glenn gould .
he fell into disgrace with glenn gould and i had been in america for just a few days . bill should have known better : he went to glenn just before the recording session , put his hand on his shoulder , and asked him how he was doing .
later glenn claimed his shoulder had been dislocated because the tuner had slapped him on the shoulder , which was n't true .
he had to cancel concerts and had a lawsuit with steinway . bill could n't tune for him anymore , so i was sent by steinway to take care of glenn gould .
over the years we became very good friends .
i went nearly every month to toronto to do his recording in the later years .
he knew that i would come to toronto with rubenstein or horowitz or serkin and he would never go to anyone 's concert .
but he knew that i was coming and he would pick me up at the airport and make sure we spent the evening together , listening to recordings and talking . you know so many of the top pianists from the 20th century - both musically and personally .
do you see any patterns ?
what makes them great ? in german we call it " ausstrahlung " - a presence , a communication from the stage to the people , which many people do not have .
if you have this , it does n't even matter if you play a lot of wrong notes .
of course , rubenstein , horowitz and serkin had this . franz mohr lives in new york and , though nearing 80 , he still travels regularly as a piano technician , teacher and lecturer .
he currently tours with italian pianist mauricio pollini .
mohr 's book , " my life with the great pianists " , has been translated into seven languages and is available at most online bookstores . kate bowen interviewed franz mohr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart : a pop icon with staying power from his beginnings as a child prodigy under the thumb of a demanding father to later year-long tours and an extravagant lifestyle , mozart set the pop star bar high , even for today 's standards .

" i think what we 're all looking for now is to get beyond the rock , paper , scissors dynamic , " said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity . the talks have " so many moving parts " that everyone needs to shift at the same time to keep the machine moving forward , said the official . the geneva gathering , behind closed doors at the us mission in geneva , is scheduled to continue monday and be followed by further talks on july 28-29 . it comes in the wake of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit of leading powers in saint petersburg , russia . hopes for conclusion by year-end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 wants a resolution in the doha round talks the g8 , which comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states , and russia which is not a wto member , on july 16 had said that negotiators must within weeks thrash out the broad outlines of a deal and help steer the doha round to its conclusion by the end of the year . the following day , g8 leaders joined forces with counterparts from brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa to try to spur the doha round on . the negotiations began in capital of qatar in 2001 with the aim of producing an international treaty that would tear down trade barriers such as subsidies and customs duties and enable trade to improve living standards in developing countries . the round was meant to end in 2004 .
that target was later shifted to december 2006 because of persistent breakdowns . the talks have swung back and forth from collapse to revival , leaving behind a string of missed deadlines . rumors of a deal a so-called crunch session at the beginning of this month fizzled out without a breakthrough .
but rumors have been flying since the g8 summit that , behind closed doors , the leaders cut a deal to end the doha deadlock . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush offered deep subsidy cuts it has been suggested that us president george w. bush offered deeper cuts in washington 's farm subsidies , which according to critics skew trade in favor of agribusiness in the united states . in october , in what it billed as a bold move to jumpstart the doha round , washington offered to slash its payouts by 53 percent . other wto members were and are still unhappy , saying the proposal lacks bite and would leave the us room to spend around $ 22 billion - more than current payouts . there have been claims that during the g8 , bush offered to set a ceiling of $ 15 billion .
but several trade diplomats have dismissed the suggestion that the g8 leaders talked figures , with one saying it is based on " very wishful thinking . " deeper cuts would be a tough sell domestically for the us leader ahead of crucial mid-term elections in november . developing countries , meanwhile , also want the eu to reduce its customs duties on imports of agricultural goods . eu ready to bargain over tariffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson at the wto talks last month , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said that if others made the right moves , the eu was prepared to step " towards and close to " the 54-percent tariff cut demanded by brazil and india , which steer the powerful g20 lobby of developing countries . the current eu proposal is 39 percent , although eu officials have said brussels could accept 51 percent .
" if we are going to move towards the g20 figures on tariffs - and we 're prepared to do that - the us is going to have to do the same on subsidies , " said an eu diplomat . washington and brussels agree on one thing : they want more concessions from the developing world on trade in services and manufactured goods . the specific target for the upcoming wto meetings is a deal on " modalities " - wto jargon for the mathematics for cutting subsidies and customs duties - a key step towards a final treaty . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 leaders end summit with focus on trade the leaders of the group of eight ended their three-day summit in russia with a push to salvage global free-trade talks that are teetering on the verge of collapse .

but the family-run company has humble roots - it began by transporting furniture and offering bus tours , said gerald kassner the company 's sole proprietor . the business ' name came from kassner 's grand father , who founded the company .
the first bus tours offered in the 1950s took tourists to the black forest and kassner 's grandfather was so impressed with the 1,284-meter -lrb- 4,213-foot -rrb- schauinsland mountain the visitors went to see near the city of freiburg , he named his company after it .
the name translates roughly to " look into the country . " taking on the big boys , and winning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's beaches are popular among for german tourists visitors ca n't book bus tours with schauinsland travel anymore , but they can fly with the company to tourist destinations , as some 350,000 people do every year .
half of the tourists head to spain or the canary islands with others boarding flights for egypt , tunisia and the dominican republic , contributing to the company 's 200 million euros -lrb- $ 253 million -rrb- in revenues and 20 percent growth . however .
kassner , who employees 90 people , said he does not want to become a major international player in the branch , not to mention be swallowed up by another company . " we do not owe anything to shareholders and do not have any subsidiaries , " he said .
" the capital stays with the company so that we have the chance to work effectively . " breaking the unwritten rules schauinsland surprised a number of the travel industry 's larger companies for its willingness to break the branch 's unwritten rule of keeping customers locked into all-inclusive flight and hotel deals . " with us you can book just the hotel or you can combine the hotel with other flights , " kassner said .
" we have a lot of combination possibilities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early negotiation can make gettting a fair price difficult the some 10,000 of germany 's 12,000 travel agents who offer schauinsland tours also know what they can offer customers long before they 've heard from other tour companies .
the duisburg company 's winter 2006/2007 catalog landed on desks in may , considerably earlier than its competitors who do n't tend to start thinking about it until the second half of the year . this means the hardest part of kassner 's job - negotiating room prices with hotels - also has to be done earlier . " the individual hotels do not always want to publish their prices so early , especially attractive , fair-market prices , " he said , adding that company representatives went on a shopping trip in april to work out lower prices .

the crazy ruler , as many called him , commissioned the construction of castle after castle - whose grandiosity and splendor eventually led to his ruin . the most famous among king ludwig 's castle collection is neuschwanstein , located in southern bavaria .
this sightseeing must is high on the list of nearly every tourist to germany , which is why efforts have been made in the past few years to ease the flow of visitors with a new " traffic control " system . longs waits were the biggest complaint among castle guests , but administrator klaus peter scheck explained that things have changed : " when the visitor buys a ticket he receives an entry time and a tour time printed on the ticket , along with a tour number . " once a quiet retreat , now viewed by millions though waits have been shortened , visitors still have to take into account the 30 minute drive there , as the castle is perched on the top of a cliff 1,000 meters -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- high .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle attracts around 1.3 million tourists per year those who venture there will be well rewarded .
king ludwig 's aim was to build an " ideal castle , " based on old knights ' castles - a goal most would say he achieved . though it was meant as a place of quiet retreat for the mad king and not for the public , the neuschwanstein castle was opened to visitors shortly after his death in 1886 .
since that time , some 1.3 million people come each year to be dazzled by the gold and glitter , velvet and silk , kitsch and art that the castle has to offer . a room for richard wagner " there are around 90 rooms , 16 of which are fully restored , " described klaus peter scheck , " the most important room in the castle is the " sängersaal " -lrb- singers ' hall -rrb- .
art historians say it 's the reason why the castle was built in the first place . " the singers ' hall , ornamented with golden chandeliers , was dedicated to the composer richard wagner .
scenes from wagner 's operas , which are based on german mythology , adorn walls throughout the castle . king ludwig was not known for having a grip on reality , espcially the reality of his finances . the neuschwanstein castle overextended his financial resources .
in 1886 , the 40-year-old king was declared unfit and ejected from the throne .
shortly thereafter , he took his own life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion has changed a bit since king ludwig 's era a hi-tech castle from the beginning but the mad king 's fairy tale castle lives on - for as many as 6,000 visitors a day , in peak season . in addition to the tour appointment system , a new museum shop has been added to the site .
not only the usual knickknacks but also more intellectual items can be found there , like the bavarian castle administration 's publication . a solution to waiting in long lines at the museum shop has also been implemented : tech savvy visitors can order online at neuschwanstein 's own internet book shop . it 's only fitting that the castle should carry on ludwig 's hi-tech approach .
in those days , all the rooms were warmed via a hot-air central heating system and each floor had running water - modern luxuries back then . keeping up with the upkeep however , being built with up-to-date accouterments has n't kept the castle from aging over the years . " the biggest problem is the visitors themselves " because they bring moisture with them , admitted scheck .
" all the textiles and murals suffer from the moisture . " on the other hand , the fact that the castle has n't been heated in 130 years has minimized the damage , added the castle director .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be one of the next seven wonders of the world in addition to the visitors , mother nature also makes regular upkeep around the castle a necessity .
the cliffs that the castle rests on have to be continually reinforced because weather wears the limestone away . both regular maintenance and the latest major improvements have n't been cheap .
the state of bavaria has spent 11 million euros -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in the last 15 years on renovations and the new " traffic control " system for visitors .
that may sound like a lot , but neuschwanstein is also a good source of income . the next world wonder ? what 's more , the investment may be rewarded with something priceless : a coveted " seven wonders of the world " title . a former unesco staff member came up with idea to revise the long-standing list of wonders and a committee of experts selected 21 cultural sites throughout the world , including neuschwanstein .
until july 2007 , anyone can place their vote for the bavarian castle by visiting www.neuschwanstein.de. neuschwanstein as one of the next wonders of the world ?

" i think what we 're all looking for now is to get beyond the rock , paper , scissors dynamic , " said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity . the talks have " so many moving parts " that everyone needs to shift at the same time to keep the machine moving forward , said the official . the geneva gathering , behind closed doors at the us mission in geneva , is scheduled to continue monday and be followed by further talks on july 28-29 . it comes in the wake of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit of leading powers in saint petersburg , russia . hopes for conclusion by year-end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 wants a resolution in the doha round talks the g8 , which comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states , and russia which is not a wto member , on july 16 had said that negotiators must within weeks thrash out the broad outlines of a deal and help steer the doha round to its conclusion by the end of the year . the following day , g8 leaders joined forces with counterparts from brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa to try to spur the doha round on . the negotiations began in capital of qatar in 2001 with the aim of producing an international treaty that would tear down trade barriers such as subsidies and customs duties and enable trade to improve living standards in developing countries . the round was meant to end in 2004 .
that target was later shifted to december 2006 because of persistent breakdowns . the talks have swung back and forth from collapse to revival , leaving behind a string of missed deadlines . rumors of a deal a so-called crunch session at the beginning of this month fizzled out without a breakthrough .
but rumors have been flying since the g8 summit that , behind closed doors , the leaders cut a deal to end the doha deadlock . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush offered deep subsidy cuts it has been suggested that us president george w. bush offered deeper cuts in washington 's farm subsidies , which according to critics skew trade in favor of agribusiness in the united states . in october , in what it billed as a bold move to jumpstart the doha round , washington offered to slash its payouts by 53 percent . other wto members were and are still unhappy , saying the proposal lacks bite and would leave the us room to spend around $ 22 billion - more than current payouts . there have been claims that during the g8 , bush offered to set a ceiling of $ 15 billion .
but several trade diplomats have dismissed the suggestion that the g8 leaders talked figures , with one saying it is based on " very wishful thinking . " deeper cuts would be a tough sell domestically for the us leader ahead of crucial mid-term elections in november . developing countries , meanwhile , also want the eu to reduce its customs duties on imports of agricultural goods . eu ready to bargain over tariffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson at the wto talks last month , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said that if others made the right moves , the eu was prepared to step " towards and close to " the 54-percent tariff cut demanded by brazil and india , which steer the powerful g20 lobby of developing countries . the current eu proposal is 39 percent , although eu officials have said brussels could accept 51 percent .
" if we are going to move towards the g20 figures on tariffs - and we 're prepared to do that - the us is going to have to do the same on subsidies , " said an eu diplomat . washington and brussels agree on one thing : they want more concessions from the developing world on trade in services and manufactured goods . the specific target for the upcoming wto meetings is a deal on " modalities " - wto jargon for the mathematics for cutting subsidies and customs duties - a key step towards a final treaty . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 leaders end summit with focus on trade the leaders of the group of eight ended their three-day summit in russia with a push to salvage global free-trade talks that are teetering on the verge of collapse .

he talked with dw-world.de about his career as steinway & sons chief piano technician . franz mohr has a way of endearing himself to everyone he comes into contact with .
in his 30-year career as a piano technician for piano greats like vladimir horowitz , arthur rubenstein and glenn gould , mohr became more than just a highly valued tuner : he was also a friend and confident to the pianists he worked with . this was part of the success he had as steinway 's chief piano technician - a job that meant tempering not only grand pianos , but also dealing with the often unpredictable temperaments of the world famous artists who performed on them . 79-year-old mohr is a native of düren , germany , where he and his parents miraculously survived severe allied bombings in 1944 .
after training to be a piano technician in germany , he immigrated to new york in 1962 to accept a job with steinway & sons .
three years later , he became the piano maker 's chief piano technician , a role he took over from legendary tuner bill hupfer . dw-world.de : mr. mohr , how did your relationship to music begin ? franz mohr : i grew up with music .
i went to the hochschule für musik in cologne where i studied the violin .
then i developed tremendous physical problems with my left wrist .
it was terrible .
i had to take breaks and visited all kinds of doctors and finally had to come to the very painful decision that i could n't become a performing artist but had to do something else with my life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classic i saw an ad in a german music magazine that rudolf ibach sohn - the oldest piano manufacturing company in germany , founded in 1774 - was looking for apprentices .
i was already 24 years old at that time , but i thought , this also has something to do with music - why do n't i try it ?
they accepted me and i just loved working with my hands and learning about all the phases of piano building . the ultimate dream in the music world - at least as a piano technician - is steinway .
around 1954 , i applied for a job as a concert piano tuner for a concert management company in duesseldorf , which was also a steinway dealer .
and i got the job !
for the first time , i started to work on steinways and i really fell in love with them , both as a technician and as a musician . what is special about steinway pianos ? not only the design of a the piano , but also the quality of wood which goes into the piano are very important - especially when it comes to the sound board .
with this quality of wood you have a tremendously wide spectrum of tone colors . all the other instruments are mass produced , including yamaha - nothing against yamaha , but they build over 800 pianos a day and they have to use any kind of wood they come across .
their soundboard is , for instance , much thicker .
that counts for brilliance , which you need in any piano , but nothing else .
you play a pianissimo and it 's still too loud . we build steinways in two factories , in hamburg and new york , and we build 13 pianos a day .
that is the difference .
a steinway piano gets better and better all the time because of the quality of wood we use . in 1962 , you accepted a job as a piano technician with steinway & sons in new york .
did you have any difficulties adjusting to american culture when you came ? no , of course not .
we fell in love with america .
let me tell you a story : i 'd worked for many great artists in germany and had tuned for rudolf serkin there and in america .
the first thing he said to me when i visited him in vermont to work on his three concert grand pianos was , " franz , now we are in america where things are not so complicated .
now you can call me rudy . "
until that time he had always been " herr professor " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir horowitz when your predecessor bill hupfer retired in 1965 you took his position as chief piano technician .
at that point , you began working with vladimir horowitz , who you toured with and tuned for until his sudden death in 1989 .
what was horowitz like as a person ? of course , he was difficult and had a very complex personality .
you never knew when he would blow up and scream and whatever .
it took a long time before we really became such good friends .
many times before a concert he would say , " franz , you are the most important person here ! " horowitz was an accomplished steinway artist in russia when he was 19 years old .
when he ran away from russia " with a thousand rubles in his shoes " , as he always said , he came to berlin .
and immediately all the german piano companies - bösendorf , bechstein , blühtner - they all wanted him to try their pianos so he would play their product .
he tried them all , but there was never any doubt in his mind about steinway . after his death , i still traveled with his piano .
we will take the horowitz piano to japan soon and i 'm going with the piano . who else played horowitz 's piano ? in his lifetime , only one person .
that was murray perahia .
he was flabbergasted , of course , that horowitz let him play it .
but after the first piece he came back and said , " franz , i 'm sorry but i can not handle it . " each steinway is different - it feels different and sound different .
and each artist has different requirements .
horowitz died and we wanted to send the piano on tour .
but i was so afraid : who would be able to manage that piano ?
i did have to change a few things , but people just love it . what was it like to tour with horowitz ? it was wonderful !
horowitz only played on sundays and the rehearsals were always saturdays and the rest of the week i could go sightseeing .
he said , " franz bring your wife and your children , i 'll pay . "
i knew exactly what he wanted in the piano and it was a wonderful relationship - i was part of the family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glenn gould as soon as you arrived in the us in 1962 , you had the chance to work with glenn gould , who was known for being somewhat eccentric .
how did you get along with him ? my predecessor , bill hupfer , had recording session at the famous 30th street columbia record studio where he tuned for glenn gould .
he fell into disgrace with glenn gould and i had been in america for just a few days . bill should have known better : he went to glenn just before the recording session , put his hand on his shoulder , and asked him how he was doing .
later glenn claimed his shoulder had been dislocated because the tuner had slapped him on the shoulder , which was n't true .
he had to cancel concerts and had a lawsuit with steinway . bill could n't tune for him anymore , so i was sent by steinway to take care of glenn gould .
over the years we became very good friends .
i went nearly every month to toronto to do his recording in the later years .
he knew that i would come to toronto with rubenstein or horowitz or serkin and he would never go to anyone 's concert .
but he knew that i was coming and he would pick me up at the airport and make sure we spent the evening together , listening to recordings and talking . you know so many of the top pianists from the 20th century - both musically and personally .
do you see any patterns ?
what makes them great ? in german we call it " ausstrahlung " - a presence , a communication from the stage to the people , which many people do not have .
if you have this , it does n't even matter if you play a lot of wrong notes .
of course , rubenstein , horowitz and serkin had this . franz mohr lives in new york and , though nearing 80 , he still travels regularly as a piano technician , teacher and lecturer .
he currently tours with italian pianist mauricio pollini .
mohr 's book , " my life with the great pianists " , has been translated into seven languages and is available at most online bookstores . kate bowen interviewed franz mohr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart : a pop icon with staying power from his beginnings as a child prodigy under the thumb of a demanding father to later year-long tours and an extravagant lifestyle , mozart set the pop star bar high , even for today 's standards .

the crazy ruler , as many called him , commissioned the construction of castle after castle - whose grandiosity and splendor eventually led to his ruin . the most famous among king ludwig 's castle collection is neuschwanstein , located in southern bavaria .
this sightseeing must is high on the list of nearly every tourist to germany , which is why efforts have been made in the past few years to ease the flow of visitors with a new " traffic control " system . longs waits were the biggest complaint among castle guests , but administrator klaus peter scheck explained that things have changed : " when the visitor buys a ticket he receives an entry time and a tour time printed on the ticket , along with a tour number . " once a quiet retreat , now viewed by millions though waits have been shortened , visitors still have to take into account the 30 minute drive there , as the castle is perched on the top of a cliff 1,000 meters -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- high .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle attracts around 1.3 million tourists per year those who venture there will be well rewarded .
king ludwig 's aim was to build an " ideal castle , " based on old knights ' castles - a goal most would say he achieved . though it was meant as a place of quiet retreat for the mad king and not for the public , the neuschwanstein castle was opened to visitors shortly after his death in 1886 .
since that time , some 1.3 million people come each year to be dazzled by the gold and glitter , velvet and silk , kitsch and art that the castle has to offer . a room for richard wagner " there are around 90 rooms , 16 of which are fully restored , " described klaus peter scheck , " the most important room in the castle is the " sängersaal " -lrb- singers ' hall -rrb- .
art historians say it 's the reason why the castle was built in the first place . " the singers ' hall , ornamented with golden chandeliers , was dedicated to the composer richard wagner .
scenes from wagner 's operas , which are based on german mythology , adorn walls throughout the castle . king ludwig was not known for having a grip on reality , espcially the reality of his finances . the neuschwanstein castle overextended his financial resources .
in 1886 , the 40-year-old king was declared unfit and ejected from the throne .
shortly thereafter , he took his own life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion has changed a bit since king ludwig 's era a hi-tech castle from the beginning but the mad king 's fairy tale castle lives on - for as many as 6,000 visitors a day , in peak season . in addition to the tour appointment system , a new museum shop has been added to the site .
not only the usual knickknacks but also more intellectual items can be found there , like the bavarian castle administration 's publication . a solution to waiting in long lines at the museum shop has also been implemented : tech savvy visitors can order online at neuschwanstein 's own internet book shop . it 's only fitting that the castle should carry on ludwig 's hi-tech approach .
in those days , all the rooms were warmed via a hot-air central heating system and each floor had running water - modern luxuries back then . keeping up with the upkeep however , being built with up-to-date accouterments has n't kept the castle from aging over the years . " the biggest problem is the visitors themselves " because they bring moisture with them , admitted scheck .
" all the textiles and murals suffer from the moisture . " on the other hand , the fact that the castle has n't been heated in 130 years has minimized the damage , added the castle director .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be one of the next seven wonders of the world in addition to the visitors , mother nature also makes regular upkeep around the castle a necessity .
the cliffs that the castle rests on have to be continually reinforced because weather wears the limestone away . both regular maintenance and the latest major improvements have n't been cheap .
the state of bavaria has spent 11 million euros -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in the last 15 years on renovations and the new " traffic control " system for visitors .
that may sound like a lot , but neuschwanstein is also a good source of income . the next world wonder ? what 's more , the investment may be rewarded with something priceless : a coveted " seven wonders of the world " title . a former unesco staff member came up with idea to revise the long-standing list of wonders and a committee of experts selected 21 cultural sites throughout the world , including neuschwanstein .
until july 2007 , anyone can place their vote for the bavarian castle by visiting www.neuschwanstein.de. neuschwanstein as one of the next wonders of the world ?
maybe it 's a bit crazy - but king ludwig certainly would have like the idea . gaby reucher -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neuschwanstein : mad ludwig 's magical refuge from reality no visit to germany would be complete without seeing the castle that inspired disney 's magical kingdom .

" we can not allow extremist forces to define the agenda of the middle east , " steinmeier said .
" we must strive to stop extremist forces from wanting to broaden the scope of the conflict , " he said . " we are making all efforts to create the suitable conditions which will allow for a ceasefire , within a political framework aimed at reaching permanent stability in the region , " steinmeier said . israel launched its massive offensive on lebanon after the lebanese shiite group hezbollah captured two israeli soldiers in a border region on july 12 with the aim of securing a prisoner exchange . in 11 days , the conflict has killed more than 340 people in lebanon , more than 30 in israel , and forced upwards of half a million lebanese to flee their homes . complex ceasefire conditions but for his part abul gheit insisted that a prisoner swap should be part of these conditions and stressed the need for a ceasefire .
" a ceasefire is a principal and essential demand which we must concentrate on , " he said .
" reaching stability for a ceasefire must go hand in hand with certain procedures , including the swap . " israel has around 10,000 palestinian prisoners and an unknown number of lebanese in its jails .
hezbollah , like palestinian groups which snatched another soldier on june 25 , have demanded a prisoner swap with israel . germany and russia are trying to help israel secure the release of its soldiers in lebanon and the gaza strip , the german newspaper berliner zeitung reported on friday . the newspaper said the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- is trying to use its contacts within the two groups .
the head of the bnd , ernst uhrlau , in 2004 supervised a prisoner exchange between israel and hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , and egypt 's ahmed aboul gheit " the german government has in the past played a very constructive role in resolving hostage crises or the kidnapping of soldiers .
it is time for germany to do so again , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said thursday . steinmeier was just one of a number of top diplomats from europe who planned to converge on israel sunday ahead of a visit by us secretary of state condoleezza rice as world powers moved to try to end the lebanon conflict . european diplomatic frenzy the europeans are trying to push the jewish state into ending its massive blitz on lebanon , which has killed more than 350 people in 12 days , most of them civilians , and destroyed key infrastructure across the country . washington , israel 's closest ally , continues to staunchly defend the jewish state and argues that a ceasefire can only come as part of a wider diplomatic package involving the disarmament of the lebanese shiite muslim hezbollah . french foreign minister phillipe douste-blazy visited the northern city of haifa , which was hit again sunday by deadly rocket fire from hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste- blazy will meet israeli prime minister olmert douste-blazy was due to meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert later in the day , along with foreign minister tzipi livni , and palestinian president mahmud abbas in the west bank . " i am convinced that a ceasefire is possible , " douste-blazy said europeans face israel 's tough stance israel has rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire in its war against hezbollah .
" it 's too early to talk about a ceasefire , " immigration minister zeev boim said before a weekly cabinet meeting .
" we first have to reach the goals which we set , to rout hezbollah from southern lebanon . " olmert was also due to meet with german foreign minister steinmeier . britain 's junior foreign minister kim howells , due to meet livni and abbas on sunday , was also likely to push israel into easing its offensive that has also displaced more than a half million people and triggered warnings of a humanitarian catastrophe . the european diplomatic efforts are unlikely to succeed until the united states changes its position and also presses for a cessation in hostilities . washington argues that a ceasefire can come only as part of a diplomatic package that sees the disarmament of hezbollah , guarantees of israeli security on its northern border and an end to syrian and iranian backing of hezbollah . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign governments issue final evacuation orders in lebanon foreign governments stepped up efforts to evacuate their remaining nationals from lebanon on saturday amid mounting talk of an israeli ground offensive against its northern neighbor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sounds like germany krautrock created a new sound for a new generation german rap keeps it real mozart classic gets street treatment in berlin update happy birthday , herbert grönemeyer ! culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.07.2006 the man behind the pianist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz mohr has always been more than a mere piano technician after a career tuning pianos for horowitz , gould and others , franz mohr knows what makes a good piano - and pianist .
he talked with dw-world.de about his career as steinway & sons chief piano technician . franz mohr has a way of endearing himself to everyone he comes into contact with .
in his 30-year career as a piano technician for piano greats like vladimir horowitz , arthur rubenstein and glenn gould , mohr became more than just a highly valued tuner : he was also a friend and confident to the pianists he worked with . this was part of the success he had as steinway 's chief piano technician - a job that meant tempering not only grand pianos , but also dealing with the often unpredictable temperaments of the world famous artists who performed on them . 79-year-old mohr is a native of düren , germany , where he and his parents miraculously survived severe allied bombings in 1944 .
after training to be a piano technician in germany , he immigrated to new york in 1962 to accept a job with steinway & sons .
three years later , he became the piano maker 's chief piano technician , a role he took over from legendary tuner bill hupfer . dw-world.de : mr. mohr , how did your relationship to music begin ? franz mohr : i grew up with music .
i went to the hochschule für musik in cologne where i studied the violin .
then i developed tremendous physical problems with my left wrist .
it was terrible .
i had to take breaks and visited all kinds of doctors and finally had to come to the very painful decision that i could n't become a performing artist but had to do something else with my life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classic i saw an ad in a german music magazine that rudolf ibach sohn - the oldest piano manufacturing company in germany , founded in 1774 - was looking for apprentices .
i was already 24 years old at that time , but i thought , this also has something to do with music - why do n't i try it ?
they accepted me and i just loved working with my hands and learning about all the phases of piano building . the ultimate dream in the music world - at least as a piano technician - is steinway .
around 1954 , i applied for a job as a concert piano tuner for a concert management company in duesseldorf , which was also a steinway dealer .
and i got the job !
for the first time , i started to work on steinways and i really fell in love with them , both as a technician and as a musician . what is special about steinway pianos ? not only the design of a the piano , but also the quality of wood which goes into the piano are very important - especially when it comes to the sound board .
with this quality of wood you have a tremendously wide spectrum of tone colors . all the other instruments are mass produced , including yamaha - nothing against yamaha , but they build over 800 pianos a day and they have to use any kind of wood they come across .
their soundboard is , for instance , much thicker .
that counts for brilliance , which you need in any piano , but nothing else .
you play a pianissimo and it 's still too loud . we build steinways in two factories , in hamburg and new york , and we build 13 pianos a day .
that is the difference .
a steinway piano gets better and better all the time because of the quality of wood we use . in 1962 , you accepted a job as a piano technician with steinway & sons in new york .
did you have any difficulties adjusting to american culture when you came ? no , of course not .
we fell in love with america .
let me tell you a story : i 'd worked for many great artists in germany and had tuned for rudolf serkin there and in america .
the first thing he said to me when i visited him in vermont to work on his three concert grand pianos was , " franz , now we are in america where things are not so complicated .
now you can call me rudy . "
until that time he had always been " herr professor " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir horowitz when your predecessor bill hupfer retired in 1965 you took his position as chief piano technician .
at that point , you began working with vladimir horowitz , who you toured with and tuned for until his sudden death in 1989 .
what was horowitz like as a person ? of course , he was difficult and had a very complex personality .
you never knew when he would blow up and scream and whatever .
it took a long time before we really became such good friends .
many times before a concert he would say , " franz , you are the most important person here ! " horowitz was an accomplished steinway artist in russia when he was 19 years old .
when he ran away from russia " with a thousand rubles in his shoes " , as he always said , he came to berlin .
and immediately all the german piano companies - bösendorf , bechstein , blühtner - they all wanted him to try their pianos so he would play their product .
he tried them all , but there was never any doubt in his mind about steinway . after his death , i still traveled with his piano .
we will take the horowitz piano to japan soon and i 'm going with the piano . who else played horowitz 's piano ? in his lifetime , only one person .
that was murray perahia .
he was flabbergasted , of course , that horowitz let him play it .
but after the first piece he came back and said , " franz , i 'm sorry but i can not handle it . " each steinway is different - it feels different and sound different .
and each artist has different requirements .
horowitz died and we wanted to send the piano on tour .
but i was so afraid : who would be able to manage that piano ?
i did have to change a few things , but people just love it . what was it like to tour with horowitz ? it was wonderful !
horowitz only played on sundays and the rehearsals were always saturdays and the rest of the week i could go sightseeing .
he said , " franz bring your wife and your children , i 'll pay . "
i knew exactly what he wanted in the piano and it was a wonderful relationship - i was part of the family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glenn gould as soon as you arrived in the us in 1962 , you had the chance to work with glenn gould , who was known for being somewhat eccentric .
how did you get along with him ? my predecessor , bill hupfer , had recording session at the famous 30th street columbia record studio where he tuned for glenn gould .
he fell into disgrace with glenn gould and i had been in america for just a few days . bill should have known better : he went to glenn just before the recording session , put his hand on his shoulder , and asked him how he was doing .
later glenn claimed his shoulder had been dislocated because the tuner had slapped him on the shoulder , which was n't true .
he had to cancel concerts and had a lawsuit with steinway . bill could n't tune for him anymore , so i was sent by steinway to take care of glenn gould .
over the years we became very good friends .
i went nearly every month to toronto to do his recording in the later years .
he knew that i would come to toronto with rubenstein or horowitz or serkin and he would never go to anyone 's concert .
but he knew that i was coming and he would pick me up at the airport and make sure we spent the evening together , listening to recordings and talking . you know so many of the top pianists from the 20th century - both musically and personally .
do you see any patterns ?
what makes them great ? in german we call it " ausstrahlung " - a presence , a communication from the stage to the people , which many people do not have .
if you have this , it does n't even matter if you play a lot of wrong notes .
of course , rubenstein , horowitz and serkin had this . franz mohr lives in new york and , though nearing 80 , he still travels regularly as a piano technician , teacher and lecturer .
he currently tours with italian pianist mauricio pollini .
mohr 's book , " my life with the great pianists " , has been translated into seven languages and is available at most online bookstores . kate bowen interviewed franz mohr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart : a pop icon with staying power from his beginnings as a child prodigy under the thumb of a demanding father to later year-long tours and an extravagant lifestyle , mozart set the pop star bar high , even for today 's standards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sounds like germany krautrock created a new sound for a new generation german rap keeps it real mozart classic gets street treatment in berlin update happy birthday , herbert grönemeyer ! culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.07.2006 the man behind the pianist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz mohr has always been more than a mere piano technician after a career tuning pianos for horowitz , gould and others , franz mohr knows what makes a good piano - and pianist .
he talked with dw-world.de about his career as steinway & sons chief piano technician . franz mohr has a way of endearing himself to everyone he comes into contact with .
in his 30-year career as a piano technician for piano greats like vladimir horowitz , arthur rubenstein and glenn gould , mohr became more than just a highly valued tuner : he was also a friend and confident to the pianists he worked with . this was part of the success he had as steinway 's chief piano technician - a job that meant tempering not only grand pianos , but also dealing with the often unpredictable temperaments of the world famous artists who performed on them . 79-year-old mohr is a native of düren , germany , where he and his parents miraculously survived severe allied bombings in 1944 .
after training to be a piano technician in germany , he immigrated to new york in 1962 to accept a job with steinway & sons .
three years later , he became the piano maker 's chief piano technician , a role he took over from legendary tuner bill hupfer . dw-world.de : mr. mohr , how did your relationship to music begin ? franz mohr : i grew up with music .
i went to the hochschule für musik in cologne where i studied the violin .
then i developed tremendous physical problems with my left wrist .
it was terrible .
i had to take breaks and visited all kinds of doctors and finally had to come to the very painful decision that i could n't become a performing artist but had to do something else with my life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classic i saw an ad in a german music magazine that rudolf ibach sohn - the oldest piano manufacturing company in germany , founded in 1774 - was looking for apprentices .
i was already 24 years old at that time , but i thought , this also has something to do with music - why do n't i try it ?
they accepted me and i just loved working with my hands and learning about all the phases of piano building . the ultimate dream in the music world - at least as a piano technician - is steinway .
around 1954 , i applied for a job as a concert piano tuner for a concert management company in duesseldorf , which was also a steinway dealer .
and i got the job !
for the first time , i started to work on steinways and i really fell in love with them , both as a technician and as a musician . what is special about steinway pianos ? not only the design of a the piano , but also the quality of wood which goes into the piano are very important - especially when it comes to the sound board .
with this quality of wood you have a tremendously wide spectrum of tone colors . all the other instruments are mass produced , including yamaha - nothing against yamaha , but they build over 800 pianos a day and they have to use any kind of wood they come across .
their soundboard is , for instance , much thicker .
that counts for brilliance , which you need in any piano , but nothing else .
you play a pianissimo and it 's still too loud . we build steinways in two factories , in hamburg and new york , and we build 13 pianos a day .
that is the difference .
a steinway piano gets better and better all the time because of the quality of wood we use . in 1962 , you accepted a job as a piano technician with steinway & sons in new york .
did you have any difficulties adjusting to american culture when you came ? no , of course not .
we fell in love with america .
let me tell you a story : i 'd worked for many great artists in germany and had tuned for rudolf serkin there and in america .
the first thing he said to me when i visited him in vermont to work on his three concert grand pianos was , " franz , now we are in america where things are not so complicated .
now you can call me rudy . "
until that time he had always been " herr professor " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir horowitz when your predecessor bill hupfer retired in 1965 you took his position as chief piano technician .
at that point , you began working with vladimir horowitz , who you toured with and tuned for until his sudden death in 1989 .
what was horowitz like as a person ? of course , he was difficult and had a very complex personality .
you never knew when he would blow up and scream and whatever .
it took a long time before we really became such good friends .
many times before a concert he would say , " franz , you are the most important person here ! " horowitz was an accomplished steinway artist in russia when he was 19 years old .
when he ran away from russia " with a thousand rubles in his shoes " , as he always said , he came to berlin .
and immediately all the german piano companies - bösendorf , bechstein , blühtner - they all wanted him to try their pianos so he would play their product .
he tried them all , but there was never any doubt in his mind about steinway . after his death , i still traveled with his piano .
we will take the horowitz piano to japan soon and i 'm going with the piano . who else played horowitz 's piano ? in his lifetime , only one person .
that was murray perahia .
he was flabbergasted , of course , that horowitz let him play it .
but after the first piece he came back and said , " franz , i 'm sorry but i can not handle it . " each steinway is different - it feels different and sound different .
and each artist has different requirements .
horowitz died and we wanted to send the piano on tour .
but i was so afraid : who would be able to manage that piano ?
i did have to change a few things , but people just love it . what was it like to tour with horowitz ? it was wonderful !
horowitz only played on sundays and the rehearsals were always saturdays and the rest of the week i could go sightseeing .
he said , " franz bring your wife and your children , i 'll pay . "
i knew exactly what he wanted in the piano and it was a wonderful relationship - i was part of the family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glenn gould as soon as you arrived in the us in 1962 , you had the chance to work with glenn gould , who was known for being somewhat eccentric .
how did you get along with him ? my predecessor , bill hupfer , had recording session at the famous 30th street columbia record studio where he tuned for glenn gould .
he fell into disgrace with glenn gould and i had been in america for just a few days . bill should have known better : he went to glenn just before the recording session , put his hand on his shoulder , and asked him how he was doing .
later glenn claimed his shoulder had been dislocated because the tuner had slapped him on the shoulder , which was n't true .
he had to cancel concerts and had a lawsuit with steinway . bill could n't tune for him anymore , so i was sent by steinway to take care of glenn gould .
over the years we became very good friends .
i went nearly every month to toronto to do his recording in the later years .
he knew that i would come to toronto with rubenstein or horowitz or serkin and he would never go to anyone 's concert .
but he knew that i was coming and he would pick me up at the airport and make sure we spent the evening together , listening to recordings and talking . you know so many of the top pianists from the 20th century - both musically and personally .
do you see any patterns ?
what makes them great ? in german we call it " ausstrahlung " - a presence , a communication from the stage to the people , which many people do not have .
if you have this , it does n't even matter if you play a lot of wrong notes .
of course , rubenstein , horowitz and serkin had this . franz mohr lives in new york and , though nearing 80 , he still travels regularly as a piano technician , teacher and lecturer .
he currently tours with italian pianist mauricio pollini .
mohr 's book , " my life with the great pianists " , has been translated into seven languages and is available at most online bookstores . kate bowen interviewed franz mohr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart : a pop icon with staying power from his beginnings as a child prodigy under the thumb of a demanding father to later year-long tours and an extravagant lifestyle , mozart set the pop star bar high , even for today 's standards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sounds like germany krautrock created a new sound for a new generation german rap keeps it real mozart classic gets street treatment in berlin update happy birthday , herbert grönemeyer ! culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.07.2006 the man behind the pianist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz mohr has always been more than a mere piano technician after a career tuning pianos for horowitz , gould and others , franz mohr knows what makes a good piano - and pianist .
he talked with dw-world.de about his career as steinway & sons chief piano technician . franz mohr has a way of endearing himself to everyone he comes into contact with .
in his 30-year career as a piano technician for piano greats like vladimir horowitz , arthur rubenstein and glenn gould , mohr became more than just a highly valued tuner : he was also a friend and confident to the pianists he worked with . this was part of the success he had as steinway 's chief piano technician - a job that meant tempering not only grand pianos , but also dealing with the often unpredictable temperaments of the world famous artists who performed on them . 79-year-old mohr is a native of düren , germany , where he and his parents miraculously survived severe allied bombings in 1944 .
after training to be a piano technician in germany , he immigrated to new york in 1962 to accept a job with steinway & sons .
three years later , he became the piano maker 's chief piano technician , a role he took over from legendary tuner bill hupfer . dw-world.de : mr. mohr , how did your relationship to music begin ? franz mohr : i grew up with music .
i went to the hochschule für musik in cologne where i studied the violin .
then i developed tremendous physical problems with my left wrist .
it was terrible .
i had to take breaks and visited all kinds of doctors and finally had to come to the very painful decision that i could n't become a performing artist but had to do something else with my life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classic i saw an ad in a german music magazine that rudolf ibach sohn - the oldest piano manufacturing company in germany , founded in 1774 - was looking for apprentices .
i was already 24 years old at that time , but i thought , this also has something to do with music - why do n't i try it ?
they accepted me and i just loved working with my hands and learning about all the phases of piano building . the ultimate dream in the music world - at least as a piano technician - is steinway .
around 1954 , i applied for a job as a concert piano tuner for a concert management company in duesseldorf , which was also a steinway dealer .
and i got the job !
for the first time , i started to work on steinways and i really fell in love with them , both as a technician and as a musician . what is special about steinway pianos ? not only the design of a the piano , but also the quality of wood which goes into the piano are very important - especially when it comes to the sound board .
with this quality of wood you have a tremendously wide spectrum of tone colors . all the other instruments are mass produced , including yamaha - nothing against yamaha , but they build over 800 pianos a day and they have to use any kind of wood they come across .
their soundboard is , for instance , much thicker .
that counts for brilliance , which you need in any piano , but nothing else .
you play a pianissimo and it 's still too loud . we build steinways in two factories , in hamburg and new york , and we build 13 pianos a day .
that is the difference .
a steinway piano gets better and better all the time because of the quality of wood we use . in 1962 , you accepted a job as a piano technician with steinway & sons in new york .
did you have any difficulties adjusting to american culture when you came ? no , of course not .
we fell in love with america .
let me tell you a story : i 'd worked for many great artists in germany and had tuned for rudolf serkin there and in america .
the first thing he said to me when i visited him in vermont to work on his three concert grand pianos was , " franz , now we are in america where things are not so complicated .
now you can call me rudy . "
until that time he had always been " herr professor " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir horowitz when your predecessor bill hupfer retired in 1965 you took his position as chief piano technician .
at that point , you began working with vladimir horowitz , who you toured with and tuned for until his sudden death in 1989 .
what was horowitz like as a person ? of course , he was difficult and had a very complex personality .
you never knew when he would blow up and scream and whatever .
it took a long time before we really became such good friends .
many times before a concert he would say , " franz , you are the most important person here ! " horowitz was an accomplished steinway artist in russia when he was 19 years old .
when he ran away from russia " with a thousand rubles in his shoes " , as he always said , he came to berlin .
and immediately all the german piano companies - bösendorf , bechstein , blühtner - they all wanted him to try their pianos so he would play their product .
he tried them all , but there was never any doubt in his mind about steinway . after his death , i still traveled with his piano .
we will take the horowitz piano to japan soon and i 'm going with the piano . who else played horowitz 's piano ? in his lifetime , only one person .
that was murray perahia .
he was flabbergasted , of course , that horowitz let him play it .
but after the first piece he came back and said , " franz , i 'm sorry but i can not handle it . " each steinway is different - it feels different and sound different .
and each artist has different requirements .
horowitz died and we wanted to send the piano on tour .
but i was so afraid : who would be able to manage that piano ?
i did have to change a few things , but people just love it . what was it like to tour with horowitz ? it was wonderful !
horowitz only played on sundays and the rehearsals were always saturdays and the rest of the week i could go sightseeing .
he said , " franz bring your wife and your children , i 'll pay . "
i knew exactly what he wanted in the piano and it was a wonderful relationship - i was part of the family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glenn gould as soon as you arrived in the us in 1962 , you had the chance to work with glenn gould , who was known for being somewhat eccentric .
how did you get along with him ? my predecessor , bill hupfer , had recording session at the famous 30th street columbia record studio where he tuned for glenn gould .
he fell into disgrace with glenn gould and i had been in america for just a few days . bill should have known better : he went to glenn just before the recording session , put his hand on his shoulder , and asked him how he was doing .
later glenn claimed his shoulder had been dislocated because the tuner had slapped him on the shoulder , which was n't true .
he had to cancel concerts and had a lawsuit with steinway . bill could n't tune for him anymore , so i was sent by steinway to take care of glenn gould .
over the years we became very good friends .
i went nearly every month to toronto to do his recording in the later years .
he knew that i would come to toronto with rubenstein or horowitz or serkin and he would never go to anyone 's concert .
but he knew that i was coming and he would pick me up at the airport and make sure we spent the evening together , listening to recordings and talking . you know so many of the top pianists from the 20th century - both musically and personally .
do you see any patterns ?
what makes them great ? in german we call it " ausstrahlung " - a presence , a communication from the stage to the people , which many people do not have .
if you have this , it does n't even matter if you play a lot of wrong notes .
of course , rubenstein , horowitz and serkin had this . franz mohr lives in new york and , though nearing 80 , he still travels regularly as a piano technician , teacher and lecturer .
he currently tours with italian pianist mauricio pollini .
mohr 's book , " my life with the great pianists " , has been translated into seven languages and is available at most online bookstores . kate bowen interviewed franz mohr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart : a pop icon with staying power from his beginnings as a child prodigy under the thumb of a demanding father to later year-long tours and an extravagant lifestyle , mozart set the pop star bar high , even for today 's standards .

but that 's not always the case , as german minorities in eastern europe and central asia show . finding german dialects in eastern europe is getting increasingly difficult as they no longer serve as a means of communication .
that 's why they 've become a sought-after research objects for linguists such as hermann scheuriger and alfred wildfeuer . the two men said that traveling to ukraine feels like traveling back in time .
about 3,000 to 5,000 people in the western part of the country , in transcarpatia , still speak old german dialects today .

the crazy ruler , as many called him , commissioned the construction of castle after castle - whose grandiosity and splendor eventually led to his ruin . the most famous among king ludwig 's castle collection is neuschwanstein , located in southern bavaria .
this sightseeing must is high on the list of nearly every tourist to germany , which is why efforts have been made in the past few years to ease the flow of visitors with a new " traffic control " system . longs waits were the biggest complaint among castle guests , but administrator klaus peter scheck explained that things have changed : " when the visitor buys a ticket he receives an entry time and a tour time printed on the ticket , along with a tour number . " once a quiet retreat , now viewed by millions though waits have been shortened , visitors still have to take into account the 30 minute drive there , as the castle is perched on the top of a cliff 1,000 meters -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- high .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle attracts around 1.3 million tourists per year those who venture there will be well rewarded .
king ludwig 's aim was to build an " ideal castle , " based on old knights ' castles - a goal most would say he achieved . though it was meant as a place of quiet retreat for the mad king and not for the public , the neuschwanstein castle was opened to visitors shortly after his death in 1886 .
since that time , some 1.3 million people come each year to be dazzled by the gold and glitter , velvet and silk , kitsch and art that the castle has to offer . a room for richard wagner " there are around 90 rooms , 16 of which are fully restored , " described klaus peter scheck , " the most important room in the castle is the " sängersaal " -lrb- singers ' hall -rrb- .
art historians say it 's the reason why the castle was built in the first place . " the singers ' hall , ornamented with golden chandeliers , was dedicated to the composer richard wagner .
scenes from wagner 's operas , which are based on german mythology , adorn walls throughout the castle . king ludwig was not known for having a grip on reality , espcially the reality of his finances . the neuschwanstein castle overextended his financial resources .
in 1886 , the 40-year-old king was declared unfit and ejected from the throne .
shortly thereafter , he took his own life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion has changed a bit since king ludwig 's era a hi-tech castle from the beginning but the mad king 's fairy tale castle lives on - for as many as 6,000 visitors a day , in peak season . in addition to the tour appointment system , a new museum shop has been added to the site .
not only the usual knickknacks but also more intellectual items can be found there , like the bavarian castle administration 's publication . a solution to waiting in long lines at the museum shop has also been implemented : tech savvy visitors can order online at neuschwanstein 's own internet book shop . it 's only fitting that the castle should carry on ludwig 's hi-tech approach .
in those days , all the rooms were warmed via a hot-air central heating system and each floor had running water - modern luxuries back then . keeping up with the upkeep however , being built with up-to-date accouterments has n't kept the castle from aging over the years . " the biggest problem is the visitors themselves " because they bring moisture with them , admitted scheck .
" all the textiles and murals suffer from the moisture . " on the other hand , the fact that the castle has n't been heated in 130 years has minimized the damage , added the castle director .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be one of the next seven wonders of the world in addition to the visitors , mother nature also makes regular upkeep around the castle a necessity .
the cliffs that the castle rests on have to be continually reinforced because weather wears the limestone away . both regular maintenance and the latest major improvements have n't been cheap .
the state of bavaria has spent 11 million euros -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in the last 15 years on renovations and the new " traffic control " system for visitors .
that may sound like a lot , but neuschwanstein is also a good source of income . the next world wonder ? what 's more , the investment may be rewarded with something priceless : a coveted " seven wonders of the world " title . a former unesco staff member came up with idea to revise the long-standing list of wonders and a committee of experts selected 21 cultural sites throughout the world , including neuschwanstein .
until july 2007 , anyone can place their vote for the bavarian castle by visiting www.neuschwanstein.de. neuschwanstein as one of the next wonders of the world ?

but that 's not always the case , as german minorities in eastern europe and central asia show . finding german dialects in eastern europe is getting increasingly difficult as they no longer serve as a means of communication .
that 's why they 've become a sought-after research objects for linguists such as hermann scheuriger and alfred wildfeuer . the two men said that traveling to ukraine feels like traveling back in time .
about 3,000 to 5,000 people in the western part of the country , in transcarpatia , still speak old german dialects today .
franconian and bohemian german can be found here as well as a dialect from austria 's salzkammergut region . not that germans in transcarpatia would be aware of these differences . " they did n't know that they were speaking a bavarian or a frankonian dialect , " scheuriger said .
" they call their language ' swobisch , ' even though it has nothing to do with swabian . " vanishing " language islands " linguists today conserve surviving german dialects in ukraine , kazakhstan and russia on tape .
there 's not much time left , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most young ethnic germans came to germany after 1990 and attended language classes german " language islands , " meaning that the language was spoken in several nearby villages , " are no longer there , " said nina berend , a linguists who grew up in siberia and now lives in germany .
berend added that most people left after the fall of communism . " they have emigrated to germany , " she said . as a result , german dialects are rapidly disappearing .
linguist alfred wildfeuer said that some dialects wo n't be spoken in ukraine any more in the near future . " the youngest speaker of bohemian german that we encountered was 45 , " he said .
" it seems like that there are almost no children , who grow up with this dialect . " presenting a modern view of germany germany 's cultural institute , the goethe institute , is trying to preserve the dialects .
it offers language courses for those that no longer speak german as well as cultural events that are meant to offer a current view of germany to people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to modern germany than brass ensembles but ethnic germans in russia , kazakhstan and ukraine not only speak old dialects - they are also attached to an antiquated view of germany . " they are mainly interested in folklore , national costumes and flags , " said werner jost , who works for the goethe institute .
" they care about dances , songs and similar things that help them find their identity .
we do n't think that 's enough .
we think that identity that has a future is something else and try to guide them there . " learning to profit from bilingual skills living between two cultures and languages is almost always very difficult for people .
eleonara hummel , a writer , spent her youth in kazakhstan and later moved to dresden with her parents .
her work is now influenced by the experience of growing up in two different worlds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden has few similarities with cities in kazakhstan " i 've learned to appreciate the fact that i can draw from a fund that not everyone has , " she said .
" it took a while to get to this point .
only in the last couple of years , i 've stopped thinking : ' why could i not have been someone else ? '
i 've accepted it and am content . " only few people manage to see their ability to speak german as a chance while living in russia , ukraine or kazakhstan .
but some are now profiting from their bilingual skills . " an austrian ski producer has a factory in ukraine , " wildfeuer said .

but that 's not always the case , as german minorities in eastern europe and central asia show . finding german dialects in eastern europe is getting increasingly difficult as they no longer serve as a means of communication .
that 's why they 've become a sought-after research objects for linguists such as hermann scheuriger and alfred wildfeuer . the two men said that traveling to ukraine feels like traveling back in time .
about 3,000 to 5,000 people in the western part of the country , in transcarpatia , still speak old german dialects today .
franconian and bohemian german can be found here as well as a dialect from austria 's salzkammergut region . not that germans in transcarpatia would be aware of these differences . " they did n't know that they were speaking a bavarian or a frankonian dialect , " scheuriger said .
" they call their language ' swobisch , ' even though it has nothing to do with swabian . " vanishing " language islands " linguists today conserve surviving german dialects in ukraine , kazakhstan and russia on tape .
there 's not much time left , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most young ethnic germans came to germany after 1990 and attended language classes german " language islands , " meaning that the language was spoken in several nearby villages , " are no longer there , " said nina berend , a linguists who grew up in siberia and now lives in germany .
berend added that most people left after the fall of communism . " they have emigrated to germany , " she said . as a result , german dialects are rapidly disappearing .
linguist alfred wildfeuer said that some dialects wo n't be spoken in ukraine any more in the near future . " the youngest speaker of bohemian german that we encountered was 45 , " he said .
" it seems like that there are almost no children , who grow up with this dialect . " presenting a modern view of germany germany 's cultural institute , the goethe institute , is trying to preserve the dialects .
it offers language courses for those that no longer speak german as well as cultural events that are meant to offer a current view of germany to people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to modern germany than brass ensembles but ethnic germans in russia , kazakhstan and ukraine not only speak old dialects - they are also attached to an antiquated view of germany . " they are mainly interested in folklore , national costumes and flags , " said werner jost , who works for the goethe institute .
" they care about dances , songs and similar things that help them find their identity .
we do n't think that 's enough .
we think that identity that has a future is something else and try to guide them there . " learning to profit from bilingual skills living between two cultures and languages is almost always very difficult for people .
eleonara hummel , a writer , spent her youth in kazakhstan and later moved to dresden with her parents .
her work is now influenced by the experience of growing up in two different worlds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden has few similarities with cities in kazakhstan " i 've learned to appreciate the fact that i can draw from a fund that not everyone has , " she said .
" it took a while to get to this point .
only in the last couple of years , i 've stopped thinking : ' why could i not have been someone else ? '
i 've accepted it and am content . " only few people manage to see their ability to speak german as a chance while living in russia , ukraine or kazakhstan .
but some are now profiting from their bilingual skills . " an austrian ski producer has a factory in ukraine , " wildfeuer said .
" it was clearly an advantage for some to speak german already .

he talked with dw-world.de about his career as steinway & sons chief piano technician . franz mohr has a way of endearing himself to everyone he comes into contact with .
in his 30-year career as a piano technician for piano greats like vladimir horowitz , arthur rubenstein and glenn gould , mohr became more than just a highly valued tuner : he was also a friend and confident to the pianists he worked with . this was part of the success he had as steinway 's chief piano technician - a job that meant tempering not only grand pianos , but also dealing with the often unpredictable temperaments of the world famous artists who performed on them . 79-year-old mohr is a native of düren , germany , where he and his parents miraculously survived severe allied bombings in 1944 .
after training to be a piano technician in germany , he immigrated to new york in 1962 to accept a job with steinway & sons .
three years later , he became the piano maker 's chief piano technician , a role he took over from legendary tuner bill hupfer . dw-world.de : mr. mohr , how did your relationship to music begin ? franz mohr : i grew up with music .
i went to the hochschule für musik in cologne where i studied the violin .
then i developed tremendous physical problems with my left wrist .
it was terrible .
i had to take breaks and visited all kinds of doctors and finally had to come to the very painful decision that i could n't become a performing artist but had to do something else with my life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classic i saw an ad in a german music magazine that rudolf ibach sohn - the oldest piano manufacturing company in germany , founded in 1774 - was looking for apprentices .
i was already 24 years old at that time , but i thought , this also has something to do with music - why do n't i try it ?
they accepted me and i just loved working with my hands and learning about all the phases of piano building . the ultimate dream in the music world - at least as a piano technician - is steinway .
around 1954 , i applied for a job as a concert piano tuner for a concert management company in duesseldorf , which was also a steinway dealer .
and i got the job !
for the first time , i started to work on steinways and i really fell in love with them , both as a technician and as a musician . what is special about steinway pianos ? not only the design of a the piano , but also the quality of wood which goes into the piano are very important - especially when it comes to the sound board .
with this quality of wood you have a tremendously wide spectrum of tone colors . all the other instruments are mass produced , including yamaha - nothing against yamaha , but they build over 800 pianos a day and they have to use any kind of wood they come across .
their soundboard is , for instance , much thicker .
that counts for brilliance , which you need in any piano , but nothing else .
you play a pianissimo and it 's still too loud . we build steinways in two factories , in hamburg and new york , and we build 13 pianos a day .
that is the difference .
a steinway piano gets better and better all the time because of the quality of wood we use . in 1962 , you accepted a job as a piano technician with steinway & sons in new york .
did you have any difficulties adjusting to american culture when you came ? no , of course not .
we fell in love with america .
let me tell you a story : i 'd worked for many great artists in germany and had tuned for rudolf serkin there and in america .
the first thing he said to me when i visited him in vermont to work on his three concert grand pianos was , " franz , now we are in america where things are not so complicated .
now you can call me rudy . "
until that time he had always been " herr professor " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir horowitz when your predecessor bill hupfer retired in 1965 you took his position as chief piano technician .
at that point , you began working with vladimir horowitz , who you toured with and tuned for until his sudden death in 1989 .
what was horowitz like as a person ? of course , he was difficult and had a very complex personality .
you never knew when he would blow up and scream and whatever .
it took a long time before we really became such good friends .
many times before a concert he would say , " franz , you are the most important person here ! " horowitz was an accomplished steinway artist in russia when he was 19 years old .
when he ran away from russia " with a thousand rubles in his shoes " , as he always said , he came to berlin .
and immediately all the german piano companies - bösendorf , bechstein , blühtner - they all wanted him to try their pianos so he would play their product .
he tried them all , but there was never any doubt in his mind about steinway . after his death , i still traveled with his piano .
we will take the horowitz piano to japan soon and i 'm going with the piano . who else played horowitz 's piano ? in his lifetime , only one person .
that was murray perahia .
he was flabbergasted , of course , that horowitz let him play it .
but after the first piece he came back and said , " franz , i 'm sorry but i can not handle it . " each steinway is different - it feels different and sound different .
and each artist has different requirements .
horowitz died and we wanted to send the piano on tour .
but i was so afraid : who would be able to manage that piano ?
i did have to change a few things , but people just love it . what was it like to tour with horowitz ? it was wonderful !
horowitz only played on sundays and the rehearsals were always saturdays and the rest of the week i could go sightseeing .
he said , " franz bring your wife and your children , i 'll pay . "
i knew exactly what he wanted in the piano and it was a wonderful relationship - i was part of the family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glenn gould as soon as you arrived in the us in 1962 , you had the chance to work with glenn gould , who was known for being somewhat eccentric .
how did you get along with him ? my predecessor , bill hupfer , had recording session at the famous 30th street columbia record studio where he tuned for glenn gould .
he fell into disgrace with glenn gould and i had been in america for just a few days . bill should have known better : he went to glenn just before the recording session , put his hand on his shoulder , and asked him how he was doing .
later glenn claimed his shoulder had been dislocated because the tuner had slapped him on the shoulder , which was n't true .
he had to cancel concerts and had a lawsuit with steinway . bill could n't tune for him anymore , so i was sent by steinway to take care of glenn gould .
over the years we became very good friends .
i went nearly every month to toronto to do his recording in the later years .
he knew that i would come to toronto with rubenstein or horowitz or serkin and he would never go to anyone 's concert .
but he knew that i was coming and he would pick me up at the airport and make sure we spent the evening together , listening to recordings and talking . you know so many of the top pianists from the 20th century - both musically and personally .
do you see any patterns ?
what makes them great ? in german we call it " ausstrahlung " - a presence , a communication from the stage to the people , which many people do not have .
if you have this , it does n't even matter if you play a lot of wrong notes .
of course , rubenstein , horowitz and serkin had this . franz mohr lives in new york and , though nearing 80 , he still travels regularly as a piano technician , teacher and lecturer .
he currently tours with italian pianist mauricio pollini .
mohr 's book , " my life with the great pianists " , has been translated into seven languages and is available at most online bookstores . kate bowen interviewed franz mohr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart : a pop icon with staying power from his beginnings as a child prodigy under the thumb of a demanding father to later year-long tours and an extravagant lifestyle , mozart set the pop star bar high , even for today 's standards .

in his 30-year career as a piano technician for piano greats like vladimir horowitz , arthur rubenstein and glenn gould , mohr became more than just a highly valued tuner : he was also a friend and confident to the pianists he worked with . this was part of the success he had as steinway 's chief piano technician - a job that meant tempering not only grand pianos , but also dealing with the often unpredictable temperaments of the world famous artists who performed on them . 79-year-old mohr is a native of düren , germany , where he and his parents miraculously survived severe allied bombings in 1944 .
after training to be a piano technician in germany , he immigrated to new york in 1962 to accept a job with steinway & sons .
three years later , he became the piano maker 's chief piano technician , a role he took over from legendary tuner bill hupfer . dw-world.de : mr. mohr , how did your relationship to music begin ? franz mohr : i grew up with music .
i went to the hochschule für musik in cologne where i studied the violin .
then i developed tremendous physical problems with my left wrist .
it was terrible .
i had to take breaks and visited all kinds of doctors and finally had to come to the very painful decision that i could n't become a performing artist but had to do something else with my life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classic i saw an ad in a german music magazine that rudolf ibach sohn - the oldest piano manufacturing company in germany , founded in 1774 - was looking for apprentices .
i was already 24 years old at that time , but i thought , this also has something to do with music - why do n't i try it ?
they accepted me and i just loved working with my hands and learning about all the phases of piano building . the ultimate dream in the music world - at least as a piano technician - is steinway .
around 1954 , i applied for a job as a concert piano tuner for a concert management company in duesseldorf , which was also a steinway dealer .
and i got the job !
for the first time , i started to work on steinways and i really fell in love with them , both as a technician and as a musician . what is special about steinway pianos ? not only the design of a the piano , but also the quality of wood which goes into the piano are very important - especially when it comes to the sound board .
with this quality of wood you have a tremendously wide spectrum of tone colors . all the other instruments are mass produced , including yamaha - nothing against yamaha , but they build over 800 pianos a day and they have to use any kind of wood they come across .
their soundboard is , for instance , much thicker .
that counts for brilliance , which you need in any piano , but nothing else .
you play a pianissimo and it 's still too loud . we build steinways in two factories , in hamburg and new york , and we build 13 pianos a day .
that is the difference .
a steinway piano gets better and better all the time because of the quality of wood we use . in 1962 , you accepted a job as a piano technician with steinway & sons in new york .
did you have any difficulties adjusting to american culture when you came ? no , of course not .
we fell in love with america .
let me tell you a story : i 'd worked for many great artists in germany and had tuned for rudolf serkin there and in america .
the first thing he said to me when i visited him in vermont to work on his three concert grand pianos was , " franz , now we are in america where things are not so complicated .
now you can call me rudy . "
until that time he had always been " herr professor " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir horowitz when your predecessor bill hupfer retired in 1965 you took his position as chief piano technician .
at that point , you began working with vladimir horowitz , who you toured with and tuned for until his sudden death in 1989 .
what was horowitz like as a person ? of course , he was difficult and had a very complex personality .
you never knew when he would blow up and scream and whatever .
it took a long time before we really became such good friends .
many times before a concert he would say , " franz , you are the most important person here ! " horowitz was an accomplished steinway artist in russia when he was 19 years old .
when he ran away from russia " with a thousand rubles in his shoes " , as he always said , he came to berlin .
and immediately all the german piano companies - bösendorf , bechstein , blühtner - they all wanted him to try their pianos so he would play their product .
he tried them all , but there was never any doubt in his mind about steinway . after his death , i still traveled with his piano .
we will take the horowitz piano to japan soon and i 'm going with the piano . who else played horowitz 's piano ? in his lifetime , only one person .
that was murray perahia .
he was flabbergasted , of course , that horowitz let him play it .
but after the first piece he came back and said , " franz , i 'm sorry but i can not handle it . " each steinway is different - it feels different and sound different .
and each artist has different requirements .
horowitz died and we wanted to send the piano on tour .
but i was so afraid : who would be able to manage that piano ?
i did have to change a few things , but people just love it . what was it like to tour with horowitz ? it was wonderful !
horowitz only played on sundays and the rehearsals were always saturdays and the rest of the week i could go sightseeing .
he said , " franz bring your wife and your children , i 'll pay . "
i knew exactly what he wanted in the piano and it was a wonderful relationship - i was part of the family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glenn gould as soon as you arrived in the us in 1962 , you had the chance to work with glenn gould , who was known for being somewhat eccentric .
how did you get along with him ? my predecessor , bill hupfer , had recording session at the famous 30th street columbia record studio where he tuned for glenn gould .
he fell into disgrace with glenn gould and i had been in america for just a few days . bill should have known better : he went to glenn just before the recording session , put his hand on his shoulder , and asked him how he was doing .
later glenn claimed his shoulder had been dislocated because the tuner had slapped him on the shoulder , which was n't true .
he had to cancel concerts and had a lawsuit with steinway . bill could n't tune for him anymore , so i was sent by steinway to take care of glenn gould .
over the years we became very good friends .
i went nearly every month to toronto to do his recording in the later years .
he knew that i would come to toronto with rubenstein or horowitz or serkin and he would never go to anyone 's concert .
but he knew that i was coming and he would pick me up at the airport and make sure we spent the evening together , listening to recordings and talking . you know so many of the top pianists from the 20th century - both musically and personally .
do you see any patterns ?
what makes them great ? in german we call it " ausstrahlung " - a presence , a communication from the stage to the people , which many people do not have .
if you have this , it does n't even matter if you play a lot of wrong notes .
of course , rubenstein , horowitz and serkin had this . franz mohr lives in new york and , though nearing 80 , he still travels regularly as a piano technician , teacher and lecturer .
he currently tours with italian pianist mauricio pollini .

shortly thereafter , he took his own life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion has changed a bit since king ludwig 's era a hi-tech castle from the beginning but the mad king 's fairy tale castle lives on - for as many as 6,000 visitors a day , in peak season . in addition to the tour appointment system , a new museum shop has been added to the site .
not only the usual knickknacks but also more intellectual items can be found there , like the bavarian castle administration 's publication . a solution to waiting in long lines at the museum shop has also been implemented : tech savvy visitors can order online at neuschwanstein 's own internet book shop . it 's only fitting that the castle should carry on ludwig 's hi-tech approach .
in those days , all the rooms were warmed via a hot-air central heating system and each floor had running water - modern luxuries back then . keeping up with the upkeep however , being built with up-to-date accouterments has n't kept the castle from aging over the years . " the biggest problem is the visitors themselves " because they bring moisture with them , admitted scheck .
" all the textiles and murals suffer from the moisture . " on the other hand , the fact that the castle has n't been heated in 130 years has minimized the damage , added the castle director .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be one of the next seven wonders of the world in addition to the visitors , mother nature also makes regular upkeep around the castle a necessity .
the cliffs that the castle rests on have to be continually reinforced because weather wears the limestone away . both regular maintenance and the latest major improvements have n't been cheap .
the state of bavaria has spent 11 million euros -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in the last 15 years on renovations and the new " traffic control " system for visitors .
that may sound like a lot , but neuschwanstein is also a good source of income . the next world wonder ? what 's more , the investment may be rewarded with something priceless : a coveted " seven wonders of the world " title . a former unesco staff member came up with idea to revise the long-standing list of wonders and a committee of experts selected 21 cultural sites throughout the world , including neuschwanstein .
until july 2007 , anyone can place their vote for the bavarian castle by visiting www.neuschwanstein.de. neuschwanstein as one of the next wonders of the world ?
maybe it 's a bit crazy - but king ludwig certainly would have like the idea . gaby reucher -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neuschwanstein : mad ludwig 's magical refuge from reality no visit to germany would be complete without seeing the castle that inspired disney 's magical kingdom .

he talked with dw-world.de about his career as steinway & sons chief piano technician . franz mohr has a way of endearing himself to everyone he comes into contact with .
in his 30-year career as a piano technician for piano greats like vladimir horowitz , arthur rubenstein and glenn gould , mohr became more than just a highly valued tuner : he was also a friend and confident to the pianists he worked with . this was part of the success he had as steinway 's chief piano technician - a job that meant tempering not only grand pianos , but also dealing with the often unpredictable temperaments of the world famous artists who performed on them . 79-year-old mohr is a native of düren , germany , where he and his parents miraculously survived severe allied bombings in 1944 .
after training to be a piano technician in germany , he immigrated to new york in 1962 to accept a job with steinway & sons .
three years later , he became the piano maker 's chief piano technician , a role he took over from legendary tuner bill hupfer . dw-world.de : mr. mohr , how did your relationship to music begin ? franz mohr : i grew up with music .
i went to the hochschule für musik in cologne where i studied the violin .
then i developed tremendous physical problems with my left wrist .
it was terrible .
i had to take breaks and visited all kinds of doctors and finally had to come to the very painful decision that i could n't become a performing artist but had to do something else with my life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classic i saw an ad in a german music magazine that rudolf ibach sohn - the oldest piano manufacturing company in germany , founded in 1774 - was looking for apprentices .
i was already 24 years old at that time , but i thought , this also has something to do with music - why do n't i try it ?
they accepted me and i just loved working with my hands and learning about all the phases of piano building . the ultimate dream in the music world - at least as a piano technician - is steinway .
around 1954 , i applied for a job as a concert piano tuner for a concert management company in duesseldorf , which was also a steinway dealer .
and i got the job !
for the first time , i started to work on steinways and i really fell in love with them , both as a technician and as a musician . what is special about steinway pianos ? not only the design of a the piano , but also the quality of wood which goes into the piano are very important - especially when it comes to the sound board .
with this quality of wood you have a tremendously wide spectrum of tone colors . all the other instruments are mass produced , including yamaha - nothing against yamaha , but they build over 800 pianos a day and they have to use any kind of wood they come across .
their soundboard is , for instance , much thicker .
that counts for brilliance , which you need in any piano , but nothing else .
you play a pianissimo and it 's still too loud . we build steinways in two factories , in hamburg and new york , and we build 13 pianos a day .
that is the difference .
a steinway piano gets better and better all the time because of the quality of wood we use . in 1962 , you accepted a job as a piano technician with steinway & sons in new york .
did you have any difficulties adjusting to american culture when you came ? no , of course not .
we fell in love with america .
let me tell you a story : i 'd worked for many great artists in germany and had tuned for rudolf serkin there and in america .
the first thing he said to me when i visited him in vermont to work on his three concert grand pianos was , " franz , now we are in america where things are not so complicated .
now you can call me rudy . "
until that time he had always been " herr professor " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir horowitz when your predecessor bill hupfer retired in 1965 you took his position as chief piano technician .
at that point , you began working with vladimir horowitz , who you toured with and tuned for until his sudden death in 1989 .
what was horowitz like as a person ? of course , he was difficult and had a very complex personality .
you never knew when he would blow up and scream and whatever .
it took a long time before we really became such good friends .
many times before a concert he would say , " franz , you are the most important person here ! " horowitz was an accomplished steinway artist in russia when he was 19 years old .
when he ran away from russia " with a thousand rubles in his shoes " , as he always said , he came to berlin .
and immediately all the german piano companies - bösendorf , bechstein , blühtner - they all wanted him to try their pianos so he would play their product .
he tried them all , but there was never any doubt in his mind about steinway . after his death , i still traveled with his piano .
we will take the horowitz piano to japan soon and i 'm going with the piano . who else played horowitz 's piano ? in his lifetime , only one person .
that was murray perahia .
he was flabbergasted , of course , that horowitz let him play it .
but after the first piece he came back and said , " franz , i 'm sorry but i can not handle it . " each steinway is different - it feels different and sound different .
and each artist has different requirements .
horowitz died and we wanted to send the piano on tour .
but i was so afraid : who would be able to manage that piano ?
i did have to change a few things , but people just love it . what was it like to tour with horowitz ? it was wonderful !
horowitz only played on sundays and the rehearsals were always saturdays and the rest of the week i could go sightseeing .
he said , " franz bring your wife and your children , i 'll pay . "
i knew exactly what he wanted in the piano and it was a wonderful relationship - i was part of the family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glenn gould as soon as you arrived in the us in 1962 , you had the chance to work with glenn gould , who was known for being somewhat eccentric .
how did you get along with him ? my predecessor , bill hupfer , had recording session at the famous 30th street columbia record studio where he tuned for glenn gould .
he fell into disgrace with glenn gould and i had been in america for just a few days . bill should have known better : he went to glenn just before the recording session , put his hand on his shoulder , and asked him how he was doing .
later glenn claimed his shoulder had been dislocated because the tuner had slapped him on the shoulder , which was n't true .
he had to cancel concerts and had a lawsuit with steinway . bill could n't tune for him anymore , so i was sent by steinway to take care of glenn gould .
over the years we became very good friends .
i went nearly every month to toronto to do his recording in the later years .
he knew that i would come to toronto with rubenstein or horowitz or serkin and he would never go to anyone 's concert .
but he knew that i was coming and he would pick me up at the airport and make sure we spent the evening together , listening to recordings and talking . you know so many of the top pianists from the 20th century - both musically and personally .
do you see any patterns ?
what makes them great ? in german we call it " ausstrahlung " - a presence , a communication from the stage to the people , which many people do not have .
if you have this , it does n't even matter if you play a lot of wrong notes .
of course , rubenstein , horowitz and serkin had this . franz mohr lives in new york and , though nearing 80 , he still travels regularly as a piano technician , teacher and lecturer .
he currently tours with italian pianist mauricio pollini .
mohr 's book , " my life with the great pianists " , has been translated into seven languages and is available at most online bookstores . kate bowen interviewed franz mohr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart : a pop icon with staying power from his beginnings as a child prodigy under the thumb of a demanding father to later year-long tours and an extravagant lifestyle , mozart set the pop star bar high , even for today 's standards .

he talked with dw-world.de about his career as steinway & sons chief piano technician . franz mohr has a way of endearing himself to everyone he comes into contact with .
in his 30-year career as a piano technician for piano greats like vladimir horowitz , arthur rubenstein and glenn gould , mohr became more than just a highly valued tuner : he was also a friend and confident to the pianists he worked with . this was part of the success he had as steinway 's chief piano technician - a job that meant tempering not only grand pianos , but also dealing with the often unpredictable temperaments of the world famous artists who performed on them . 79-year-old mohr is a native of düren , germany , where he and his parents miraculously survived severe allied bombings in 1944 .
after training to be a piano technician in germany , he immigrated to new york in 1962 to accept a job with steinway & sons .
three years later , he became the piano maker 's chief piano technician , a role he took over from legendary tuner bill hupfer . dw-world.de : mr. mohr , how did your relationship to music begin ? franz mohr : i grew up with music .
i went to the hochschule für musik in cologne where i studied the violin .
then i developed tremendous physical problems with my left wrist .
it was terrible .
i had to take breaks and visited all kinds of doctors and finally had to come to the very painful decision that i could n't become a performing artist but had to do something else with my life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classic i saw an ad in a german music magazine that rudolf ibach sohn - the oldest piano manufacturing company in germany , founded in 1774 - was looking for apprentices .
i was already 24 years old at that time , but i thought , this also has something to do with music - why do n't i try it ?
they accepted me and i just loved working with my hands and learning about all the phases of piano building . the ultimate dream in the music world - at least as a piano technician - is steinway .
around 1954 , i applied for a job as a concert piano tuner for a concert management company in duesseldorf , which was also a steinway dealer .
and i got the job !
for the first time , i started to work on steinways and i really fell in love with them , both as a technician and as a musician . what is special about steinway pianos ? not only the design of a the piano , but also the quality of wood which goes into the piano are very important - especially when it comes to the sound board .
with this quality of wood you have a tremendously wide spectrum of tone colors . all the other instruments are mass produced , including yamaha - nothing against yamaha , but they build over 800 pianos a day and they have to use any kind of wood they come across .
their soundboard is , for instance , much thicker .
that counts for brilliance , which you need in any piano , but nothing else .
you play a pianissimo and it 's still too loud . we build steinways in two factories , in hamburg and new york , and we build 13 pianos a day .
that is the difference .
a steinway piano gets better and better all the time because of the quality of wood we use . in 1962 , you accepted a job as a piano technician with steinway & sons in new york .
did you have any difficulties adjusting to american culture when you came ? no , of course not .
we fell in love with america .
let me tell you a story : i 'd worked for many great artists in germany and had tuned for rudolf serkin there and in america .
the first thing he said to me when i visited him in vermont to work on his three concert grand pianos was , " franz , now we are in america where things are not so complicated .
now you can call me rudy . "
until that time he had always been " herr professor " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir horowitz when your predecessor bill hupfer retired in 1965 you took his position as chief piano technician .
at that point , you began working with vladimir horowitz , who you toured with and tuned for until his sudden death in 1989 .
what was horowitz like as a person ? of course , he was difficult and had a very complex personality .
you never knew when he would blow up and scream and whatever .
it took a long time before we really became such good friends .
many times before a concert he would say , " franz , you are the most important person here ! " horowitz was an accomplished steinway artist in russia when he was 19 years old .
when he ran away from russia " with a thousand rubles in his shoes " , as he always said , he came to berlin .
and immediately all the german piano companies - bösendorf , bechstein , blühtner - they all wanted him to try their pianos so he would play their product .
he tried them all , but there was never any doubt in his mind about steinway . after his death , i still traveled with his piano .
we will take the horowitz piano to japan soon and i 'm going with the piano . who else played horowitz 's piano ? in his lifetime , only one person .
that was murray perahia .
he was flabbergasted , of course , that horowitz let him play it .
but after the first piece he came back and said , " franz , i 'm sorry but i can not handle it . " each steinway is different - it feels different and sound different .
and each artist has different requirements .
horowitz died and we wanted to send the piano on tour .
but i was so afraid : who would be able to manage that piano ?
i did have to change a few things , but people just love it . what was it like to tour with horowitz ? it was wonderful !
horowitz only played on sundays and the rehearsals were always saturdays and the rest of the week i could go sightseeing .
he said , " franz bring your wife and your children , i 'll pay . "
i knew exactly what he wanted in the piano and it was a wonderful relationship - i was part of the family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glenn gould as soon as you arrived in the us in 1962 , you had the chance to work with glenn gould , who was known for being somewhat eccentric .
how did you get along with him ? my predecessor , bill hupfer , had recording session at the famous 30th street columbia record studio where he tuned for glenn gould .
he fell into disgrace with glenn gould and i had been in america for just a few days . bill should have known better : he went to glenn just before the recording session , put his hand on his shoulder , and asked him how he was doing .
later glenn claimed his shoulder had been dislocated because the tuner had slapped him on the shoulder , which was n't true .
he had to cancel concerts and had a lawsuit with steinway . bill could n't tune for him anymore , so i was sent by steinway to take care of glenn gould .
over the years we became very good friends .
i went nearly every month to toronto to do his recording in the later years .
he knew that i would come to toronto with rubenstein or horowitz or serkin and he would never go to anyone 's concert .
but he knew that i was coming and he would pick me up at the airport and make sure we spent the evening together , listening to recordings and talking . you know so many of the top pianists from the 20th century - both musically and personally .
do you see any patterns ?
what makes them great ? in german we call it " ausstrahlung " - a presence , a communication from the stage to the people , which many people do not have .
if you have this , it does n't even matter if you play a lot of wrong notes .
of course , rubenstein , horowitz and serkin had this . franz mohr lives in new york and , though nearing 80 , he still travels regularly as a piano technician , teacher and lecturer .
he currently tours with italian pianist mauricio pollini .
mohr 's book , " my life with the great pianists " , has been translated into seven languages and is available at most online bookstores . kate bowen interviewed franz mohr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart : a pop icon with staying power from his beginnings as a child prodigy under the thumb of a demanding father to later year-long tours and an extravagant lifestyle , mozart set the pop star bar high , even for today 's standards .

" i think what we 're all looking for now is to get beyond the rock , paper , scissors dynamic , " said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity . the talks have " so many moving parts " that everyone needs to shift at the same time to keep the machine moving forward , said the official . the geneva gathering , behind closed doors at the us mission in geneva , is scheduled to continue monday and be followed by further talks on july 28-29 . it comes in the wake of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit of leading powers in saint petersburg , russia . hopes for conclusion by year-end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 wants a resolution in the doha round talks the g8 , which comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states , and russia which is not a wto member , on july 16 had said that negotiators must within weeks thrash out the broad outlines of a deal and help steer the doha round to its conclusion by the end of the year . the following day , g8 leaders joined forces with counterparts from brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa to try to spur the doha round on . the negotiations began in capital of qatar in 2001 with the aim of producing an international treaty that would tear down trade barriers such as subsidies and customs duties and enable trade to improve living standards in developing countries . the round was meant to end in 2004 .
that target was later shifted to december 2006 because of persistent breakdowns . the talks have swung back and forth from collapse to revival , leaving behind a string of missed deadlines . rumors of a deal a so-called crunch session at the beginning of this month fizzled out without a breakthrough .
but rumors have been flying since the g8 summit that , behind closed doors , the leaders cut a deal to end the doha deadlock . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush offered deep subsidy cuts it has been suggested that us president george w. bush offered deeper cuts in washington 's farm subsidies , which according to critics skew trade in favor of agribusiness in the united states . in october , in what it billed as a bold move to jumpstart the doha round , washington offered to slash its payouts by 53 percent . other wto members were and are still unhappy , saying the proposal lacks bite and would leave the us room to spend around $ 22 billion - more than current payouts . there have been claims that during the g8 , bush offered to set a ceiling of $ 15 billion .
but several trade diplomats have dismissed the suggestion that the g8 leaders talked figures , with one saying it is based on " very wishful thinking . " deeper cuts would be a tough sell domestically for the us leader ahead of crucial mid-term elections in november . developing countries , meanwhile , also want the eu to reduce its customs duties on imports of agricultural goods . eu ready to bargain over tariffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson at the wto talks last month , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said that if others made the right moves , the eu was prepared to step " towards and close to " the 54-percent tariff cut demanded by brazil and india , which steer the powerful g20 lobby of developing countries . the current eu proposal is 39 percent , although eu officials have said brussels could accept 51 percent .
" if we are going to move towards the g20 figures on tariffs - and we 're prepared to do that - the us is going to have to do the same on subsidies , " said an eu diplomat . washington and brussels agree on one thing : they want more concessions from the developing world on trade in services and manufactured goods . the specific target for the upcoming wto meetings is a deal on " modalities " - wto jargon for the mathematics for cutting subsidies and customs duties - a key step towards a final treaty . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 leaders end summit with focus on trade the leaders of the group of eight ended their three-day summit in russia with a push to salvage global free-trade talks that are teetering on the verge of collapse .
-lrb- july 17 , 2006 -rrb- wto powers seek elusive common ground in brazil the eu , us and brazilian trade chiefs are meeting in rio de janeiro this weekend in a bid to bridge yawning differences on how to tear down global trade barriers before an april deadline .

so the club , culture on the road , is stepping in , fighting intolerance , violence and racism through music . in eastern germany , skinheads and others attracted to the far-right are not in the minority .
for example , in local elections in saxony in 2004 , almost one out of every four first-time voters chose the rightwing npd party .
one reason for the party 's good performance in the elections is that it provides jobs to the young . the club , culture on the road , is trying to take on and embrace the diversity of youth culture .
it does n't matter whether it is punk , hip hop or black metal - anything is better than the right fringe .
the club offers information , holds discussions and workshops keeping in mind , the style , music and political background of the diverse youth movements . a record as a tool it is dj training class at a special school for the learning-disabled in blankenhain in the eastern german state of thuringia .
and instead of math homework , the students sit curious before two turntables .
peer wiechmann shows the students how to lay a record down and find the right beat . " you take your hand and lay the record , here and there , " he tells the kids .
" at first , try to be relatively even so that you produce a real beat .
and after you feel more secure , try and lay another down and get another beat to overlay on the first . " everyone gets a change to try it .
bastian , 14 , is really getting into it .
" it is really interesting to do it yourself , " he said .
" and also to get tips and learn something new from someone with experience . weichmann answers all the kids questions , shows tricks .
but he also knows that he is no dj . youth culture is tolerant wiechmann comes from the weimar-based network against rightwing extremism who issued the contract for the event .
afterward , he picked up his team in berlin on the way to blankenhain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project aims to engage young people in meaninful discussions " we have a strong sense of camaraderie and commitment , " he said .
" and we try to capture the children through music and dance .
youth culture is essentially by its nature tolerant , diverse and international .
that is what we communicate and everyone seems to like that . " culture on the road is a colourful team of 15 young people .
several members of the group have studied political science and are especially familiar with right-wing extremist ideology .
others come from different youth scenes such as hip hop , techno or metal .
an american member of the group played in a punk band for years .
she offers day-long workshops with music . in the east , hating foreigners is normal silke baer is responsible for the concept .
she wants with the project above all to reach those young people in the new eastern german states , where she says that the group has learned through experience that " seeing foreigners as the enemy is an absolutely normal thing . " " we go into this region and talk with kids about youth culture through political discussions , " she said .
" in this way , we try to bring them closer into the democratic fold . " that most youth culture comes from abroad is one point , she says .
another is the history of such movements .
for example , hardly any kids know that the punk movement of the 1970s arose out of the high unemployment in the younger ranks in the uk .
this is something that baer knows only too well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : culture is one way to reach those hard-to-reach young people sociologist michaela glaser from the german youth institute in halle says that these types of youth projects are indispensable . " the important thing is that there is first access to the young in order to be able to work with them , " she said .
" and it is just these projects , in our experience , that help the young become more open and be ready for future conflicts . " not a one-time thing and it is also important to be consistent and not have such projects be a one-time occurrence otherwise they will be in vain , said glaser .
that is a danger in many communities with empty cash registers who have already stricken youth programs from their tight budgets . corinna hundshagen , the director of the blankenhain school says that her staff wants to remain on the ball . " i have already spoken to peer weichmann and requested that at the very least , he should remain in contact , " she said .
" we want to do certain projects still with our local youth club .
we have made a start and now we have to see how we can move forward .

but the family-run company has humble roots - it began by transporting furniture and offering bus tours , said gerald kassner the company 's sole proprietor . the business ' name came from kassner 's grand father , who founded the company .
the first bus tours offered in the 1950s took tourists to the black forest and kassner 's grandfather was so impressed with the 1,284-meter -lrb- 4,213-foot -rrb- schauinsland mountain the visitors went to see near the city of freiburg , he named his company after it .
the name translates roughly to " look into the country . " taking on the big boys , and winning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's beaches are popular among for german tourists visitors ca n't book bus tours with schauinsland travel anymore , but they can fly with the company to tourist destinations , as some 350,000 people do every year .
half of the tourists head to spain or the canary islands with others boarding flights for egypt , tunisia and the dominican republic , contributing to the company 's 200 million euros -lrb- $ 253 million -rrb- in revenues and 20 percent growth . however .
kassner , who employees 90 people , said he does not want to become a major international player in the branch , not to mention be swallowed up by another company . " we do not owe anything to shareholders and do not have any subsidiaries , " he said .
" the capital stays with the company so that we have the chance to work effectively . " breaking the unwritten rules schauinsland surprised a number of the travel industry 's larger companies for its willingness to break the branch 's unwritten rule of keeping customers locked into all-inclusive flight and hotel deals . " with us you can book just the hotel or you can combine the hotel with other flights , " kassner said .
" we have a lot of combination possibilities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early negotiation can make gettting a fair price difficult the some 10,000 of germany 's 12,000 travel agents who offer schauinsland tours also know what they can offer customers long before they 've heard from other tour companies .
the duisburg company 's winter 2006/2007 catalog landed on desks in may , considerably earlier than its competitors who do n't tend to start thinking about it until the second half of the year . this means the hardest part of kassner 's job - negotiating room prices with hotels - also has to be done earlier . " the individual hotels do not always want to publish their prices so early , especially attractive , fair-market prices , " he said , adding that company representatives went on a shopping trip in april to work out lower prices .
" the bookings arriving for the coming winter are very positive .

so the club , culture on the road , is stepping in , fighting intolerance , violence and racism through music . in eastern germany , skinheads and others attracted to the far-right are not in the minority .
for example , in local elections in saxony in 2004 , almost one out of every four first-time voters chose the rightwing npd party .
one reason for the party 's good performance in the elections is that it provides jobs to the young . the club , culture on the road , is trying to take on and embrace the diversity of youth culture .
it does n't matter whether it is punk , hip hop or black metal - anything is better than the right fringe .
the club offers information , holds discussions and workshops keeping in mind , the style , music and political background of the diverse youth movements . a record as a tool it is dj training class at a special school for the learning-disabled in blankenhain in the eastern german state of thuringia .
and instead of math homework , the students sit curious before two turntables .
peer wiechmann shows the students how to lay a record down and find the right beat . " you take your hand and lay the record , here and there , " he tells the kids .
" at first , try to be relatively even so that you produce a real beat .
and after you feel more secure , try and lay another down and get another beat to overlay on the first . " everyone gets a change to try it .
bastian , 14 , is really getting into it .
" it is really interesting to do it yourself , " he said .
" and also to get tips and learn something new from someone with experience . weichmann answers all the kids questions , shows tricks .
but he also knows that he is no dj . youth culture is tolerant wiechmann comes from the weimar-based network against rightwing extremism who issued the contract for the event .
afterward , he picked up his team in berlin on the way to blankenhain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project aims to engage young people in meaninful discussions " we have a strong sense of camaraderie and commitment , " he said .
" and we try to capture the children through music and dance .
youth culture is essentially by its nature tolerant , diverse and international .
that is what we communicate and everyone seems to like that . " culture on the road is a colourful team of 15 young people .
several members of the group have studied political science and are especially familiar with right-wing extremist ideology .
others come from different youth scenes such as hip hop , techno or metal .
an american member of the group played in a punk band for years .
she offers day-long workshops with music . in the east , hating foreigners is normal silke baer is responsible for the concept .
she wants with the project above all to reach those young people in the new eastern german states , where she says that the group has learned through experience that " seeing foreigners as the enemy is an absolutely normal thing . " " we go into this region and talk with kids about youth culture through political discussions , " she said .
" in this way , we try to bring them closer into the democratic fold . " that most youth culture comes from abroad is one point , she says .
another is the history of such movements .
for example , hardly any kids know that the punk movement of the 1970s arose out of the high unemployment in the younger ranks in the uk .
this is something that baer knows only too well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : culture is one way to reach those hard-to-reach young people sociologist michaela glaser from the german youth institute in halle says that these types of youth projects are indispensable . " the important thing is that there is first access to the young in order to be able to work with them , " she said .
" and it is just these projects , in our experience , that help the young become more open and be ready for future conflicts . " not a one-time thing and it is also important to be consistent and not have such projects be a one-time occurrence otherwise they will be in vain , said glaser .
that is a danger in many communities with empty cash registers who have already stricken youth programs from their tight budgets . corinna hundshagen , the director of the blankenhain school says that her staff wants to remain on the ball . " i have already spoken to peer weichmann and requested that at the very least , he should remain in contact , " she said .
" we want to do certain projects still with our local youth club .
we have made a start and now we have to see how we can move forward .

the crazy ruler , as many called him , commissioned the construction of castle after castle - whose grandiosity and splendor eventually led to his ruin . the most famous among king ludwig 's castle collection is neuschwanstein , located in southern bavaria .
this sightseeing must is high on the list of nearly every tourist to germany , which is why efforts have been made in the past few years to ease the flow of visitors with a new " traffic control " system . longs waits were the biggest complaint among castle guests , but administrator klaus peter scheck explained that things have changed : " when the visitor buys a ticket he receives an entry time and a tour time printed on the ticket , along with a tour number . " once a quiet retreat , now viewed by millions though waits have been shortened , visitors still have to take into account the 30 minute drive there , as the castle is perched on the top of a cliff 1,000 meters -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- high .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle attracts around 1.3 million tourists per year those who venture there will be well rewarded .
king ludwig 's aim was to build an " ideal castle , " based on old knights ' castles - a goal most would say he achieved . though it was meant as a place of quiet retreat for the mad king and not for the public , the neuschwanstein castle was opened to visitors shortly after his death in 1886 .
since that time , some 1.3 million people come each year to be dazzled by the gold and glitter , velvet and silk , kitsch and art that the castle has to offer . a room for richard wagner " there are around 90 rooms , 16 of which are fully restored , " described klaus peter scheck , " the most important room in the castle is the " sängersaal " -lrb- singers ' hall -rrb- .
art historians say it 's the reason why the castle was built in the first place . " the singers ' hall , ornamented with golden chandeliers , was dedicated to the composer richard wagner .
scenes from wagner 's operas , which are based on german mythology , adorn walls throughout the castle . king ludwig was not known for having a grip on reality , espcially the reality of his finances . the neuschwanstein castle overextended his financial resources .
in 1886 , the 40-year-old king was declared unfit and ejected from the throne .
shortly thereafter , he took his own life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion has changed a bit since king ludwig 's era a hi-tech castle from the beginning but the mad king 's fairy tale castle lives on - for as many as 6,000 visitors a day , in peak season . in addition to the tour appointment system , a new museum shop has been added to the site .
not only the usual knickknacks but also more intellectual items can be found there , like the bavarian castle administration 's publication . a solution to waiting in long lines at the museum shop has also been implemented : tech savvy visitors can order online at neuschwanstein 's own internet book shop . it 's only fitting that the castle should carry on ludwig 's hi-tech approach .
in those days , all the rooms were warmed via a hot-air central heating system and each floor had running water - modern luxuries back then . keeping up with the upkeep however , being built with up-to-date accouterments has n't kept the castle from aging over the years . " the biggest problem is the visitors themselves " because they bring moisture with them , admitted scheck .
" all the textiles and murals suffer from the moisture . " on the other hand , the fact that the castle has n't been heated in 130 years has minimized the damage , added the castle director .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be one of the next seven wonders of the world in addition to the visitors , mother nature also makes regular upkeep around the castle a necessity .
the cliffs that the castle rests on have to be continually reinforced because weather wears the limestone away . both regular maintenance and the latest major improvements have n't been cheap .
the state of bavaria has spent 11 million euros -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in the last 15 years on renovations and the new " traffic control " system for visitors .
that may sound like a lot , but neuschwanstein is also a good source of income . the next world wonder ? what 's more , the investment may be rewarded with something priceless : a coveted " seven wonders of the world " title . a former unesco staff member came up with idea to revise the long-standing list of wonders and a committee of experts selected 21 cultural sites throughout the world , including neuschwanstein .
until july 2007 , anyone can place their vote for the bavarian castle by visiting www.neuschwanstein.de. neuschwanstein as one of the next wonders of the world ?
maybe it 's a bit crazy - but king ludwig certainly would have like the idea . gaby reucher -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neuschwanstein : mad ludwig 's magical refuge from reality no visit to germany would be complete without seeing the castle that inspired disney 's magical kingdom .

berend added that most people left after the fall of communism . " they have emigrated to germany , " she said . as a result , german dialects are rapidly disappearing .
linguist alfred wildfeuer said that some dialects wo n't be spoken in ukraine any more in the near future . " the youngest speaker of bohemian german that we encountered was 45 , " he said .
" it seems like that there are almost no children , who grow up with this dialect . " presenting a modern view of germany germany 's cultural institute , the goethe institute , is trying to preserve the dialects .
it offers language courses for those that no longer speak german as well as cultural events that are meant to offer a current view of germany to people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to modern germany than brass ensembles but ethnic germans in russia , kazakhstan and ukraine not only speak old dialects - they are also attached to an antiquated view of germany . " they are mainly interested in folklore , national costumes and flags , " said werner jost , who works for the goethe institute .
" they care about dances , songs and similar things that help them find their identity .
we do n't think that 's enough .
we think that identity that has a future is something else and try to guide them there . " learning to profit from bilingual skills living between two cultures and languages is almost always very difficult for people .
eleonara hummel , a writer , spent her youth in kazakhstan and later moved to dresden with her parents .
her work is now influenced by the experience of growing up in two different worlds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden has few similarities with cities in kazakhstan " i 've learned to appreciate the fact that i can draw from a fund that not everyone has , " she said .
" it took a while to get to this point .
only in the last couple of years , i 've stopped thinking : ' why could i not have been someone else ? '
i 've accepted it and am content . " only few people manage to see their ability to speak german as a chance while living in russia , ukraine or kazakhstan .
but some are now profiting from their bilingual skills . " an austrian ski producer has a factory in ukraine , " wildfeuer said .
" it was clearly an advantage for some to speak german already .

" we can not allow extremist forces to define the agenda of the middle east , " steinmeier said .
" we must strive to stop extremist forces from wanting to broaden the scope of the conflict , " he said . " we are making all efforts to create the suitable conditions which will allow for a ceasefire , within a political framework aimed at reaching permanent stability in the region , " steinmeier said . israel launched its massive offensive on lebanon after the lebanese shiite group hezbollah captured two israeli soldiers in a border region on july 12 with the aim of securing a prisoner exchange . in 11 days , the conflict has killed more than 340 people in lebanon , more than 30 in israel , and forced upwards of half a million lebanese to flee their homes . complex ceasefire conditions but for his part abul gheit insisted that a prisoner swap should be part of these conditions and stressed the need for a ceasefire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.07.2006 rice enters middle east arena with few friends for company großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters throughout the arab world blame the us for its support of israel 's campaign us secretary of state condoleezza rice embarks on a high-stakes middle east mission sunday , with the united states increasingly estranged from european and arab allies over the crisis . rice 's trip , for talks with the israeli and palestinian leaders , and an international conference on the crisis in rome , comes as more bloodshed in lebanon spurs mounting calls for a muscular us role to end the fighting . but her mission will bear little resemblance to the multi-day , multi-city middle east peace shuttles of some of her predecessors which are part of us diplomatic lore . " i could have gotten on a plane and rushed over and starting shuttling around and it would n't have been clear what i was shuttling to do , " rice said on friday . what she will not do , is accept rising demands from european and arab states for an immediate ceasefire in israel 's battle against hezbollah , regarding such a step as a " false promise " bound to simply incubate future conflicts . washington argues a ceasefire can come only as part of a diplomatic package that sees the disarmament of hezbollah , guarantees of israeli security at its northern border and an end to syrian and iranian backing of hezbollah . " secretary rice will make it clear that resolving the crisis demands confronting the terrorist group that launched the attacks and the nations that support it , " president george w. bush said saturday in his weekly radio address . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice is backed by her boss but faces widespread suspicion washington is taking a broad strategic view of the conflict , sparked when hezbollah abducted two israeli soldiers . it is therefore difficult to see the united states settling for any resolution in which hezbollah , syria and iran are not seen to have suffered a defeat . stalwart ally faltering but the us position appears to becoming increasingly lonely .
faithful us ally britain saturday criticized israel 's tactics , and even took a swipe at american strategy . the british junior foreign minister , kim howells , said in beirut : " i very much hope that the americans understand what 's happening to lebanon - the destruction of the infrastructure , the death of so many children and so many people . " rice will meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert and also see palestinian president mahmud abbas after arriving on monday . in rome , on wednesday , she will face desperate lebanese leaders , un officials and europeans demanding a ceasefire and arab allies who reportedly refused to host her visit , dismayed at us strategy . but some analysts said qualified progress remained possible . hopes for ceasefire follow rice " i do n't think the secretary of state would be going to the region unless they were fairly sure that she could accomplish something , " said steven cook , of the council on foreign relations .
" perhaps it 's the framework for the negotiation of a ceasefire . " jon alterman of the center for strategic and international studies agreed .
" i do n't think she would be having a meeting if she did n't know pretty well what the outcome would be , and that outcome i think is going to be a framework for future work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a possible un force may be part of rice 's plan for lebanon the eventual shape of a deal seems to be widely accepted and may include some kind of prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah , and possibly between israel and hamas in the parallel gaza conflict . an international force has been mooted to keep hezbollah and its rocket launchers out of southern lebanon and out of range of israel . but the devil looks to be in the timing . crisis not ready for a resolution neither israel nor hezbollah seem eager to stop fighting .
iran and syria may have no interest in containing it , and washington seems content for israel to continue pounding hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting continues with neither side willing to stop " there is no question that this -lrb- crisis -rrb- is not ripe for resolution at this particular moment , " said aaron david miller , a veteran us middle east peace negotiator now with the woodrow wilson center . the scope of us influence is also questioned . " they do n't have any leverage right now over the parties that hold the key to this crisis , iran , syria , the israelis , " said miller . the bush administration is also constrained in how much it can lean on israel , he added . " they are determined to maintain the moral clarity and consistency of their policy against terror , " said miller .

but the family-run company has humble roots - it began by transporting furniture and offering bus tours , said gerald kassner the company 's sole proprietor . the business ' name came from kassner 's grand father , who founded the company .
the first bus tours offered in the 1950s took tourists to the black forest and kassner 's grandfather was so impressed with the 1,284-meter -lrb- 4,213-foot -rrb- schauinsland mountain the visitors went to see near the city of freiburg , he named his company after it .
the name translates roughly to " look into the country . " taking on the big boys , and winning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's beaches are popular among for german tourists visitors ca n't book bus tours with schauinsland travel anymore , but they can fly with the company to tourist destinations , as some 350,000 people do every year .
half of the tourists head to spain or the canary islands with others boarding flights for egypt , tunisia and the dominican republic , contributing to the company 's 200 million euros -lrb- $ 253 million -rrb- in revenues and 20 percent growth . however .
kassner , who employees 90 people , said he does not want to become a major international player in the branch , not to mention be swallowed up by another company . " we do not owe anything to shareholders and do not have any subsidiaries , " he said .
" the capital stays with the company so that we have the chance to work effectively . " breaking the unwritten rules schauinsland surprised a number of the travel industry 's larger companies for its willingness to break the branch 's unwritten rule of keeping customers locked into all-inclusive flight and hotel deals . " with us you can book just the hotel or you can combine the hotel with other flights , " kassner said .
" we have a lot of combination possibilities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early negotiation can make gettting a fair price difficult the some 10,000 of germany 's 12,000 travel agents who offer schauinsland tours also know what they can offer customers long before they 've heard from other tour companies .
the duisburg company 's winter 2006/2007 catalog landed on desks in may , considerably earlier than its competitors who do n't tend to start thinking about it until the second half of the year . this means the hardest part of kassner 's job - negotiating room prices with hotels - also has to be done earlier . " the individual hotels do not always want to publish their prices so early , especially attractive , fair-market prices , " he said , adding that company representatives went on a shopping trip in april to work out lower prices .
" the bookings arriving for the coming winter are very positive .

" i think what we 're all looking for now is to get beyond the rock , paper , scissors dynamic , " said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity . the talks have " so many moving parts " that everyone needs to shift at the same time to keep the machine moving forward , said the official . the geneva gathering , behind closed doors at the us mission in geneva , is scheduled to continue monday and be followed by further talks on july 28-29 . it comes in the wake of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit of leading powers in saint petersburg , russia . hopes for conclusion by year-end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 wants a resolution in the doha round talks the g8 , which comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states , and russia which is not a wto member , on july 16 had said that negotiators must within weeks thrash out the broad outlines of a deal and help steer the doha round to its conclusion by the end of the year . the following day , g8 leaders joined forces with counterparts from brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa to try to spur the doha round on . the negotiations began in capital of qatar in 2001 with the aim of producing an international treaty that would tear down trade barriers such as subsidies and customs duties and enable trade to improve living standards in developing countries . the round was meant to end in 2004 .
that target was later shifted to december 2006 because of persistent breakdowns . the talks have swung back and forth from collapse to revival , leaving behind a string of missed deadlines . rumors of a deal a so-called crunch session at the beginning of this month fizzled out without a breakthrough .
but rumors have been flying since the g8 summit that , behind closed doors , the leaders cut a deal to end the doha deadlock . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush offered deep subsidy cuts it has been suggested that us president george w. bush offered deeper cuts in washington 's farm subsidies , which according to critics skew trade in favor of agribusiness in the united states . in october , in what it billed as a bold move to jumpstart the doha round , washington offered to slash its payouts by 53 percent . other wto members were and are still unhappy , saying the proposal lacks bite and would leave the us room to spend around $ 22 billion - more than current payouts . there have been claims that during the g8 , bush offered to set a ceiling of $ 15 billion .
but several trade diplomats have dismissed the suggestion that the g8 leaders talked figures , with one saying it is based on " very wishful thinking . " deeper cuts would be a tough sell domestically for the us leader ahead of crucial mid-term elections in november . developing countries , meanwhile , also want the eu to reduce its customs duties on imports of agricultural goods . eu ready to bargain over tariffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson at the wto talks last month , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said that if others made the right moves , the eu was prepared to step " towards and close to " the 54-percent tariff cut demanded by brazil and india , which steer the powerful g20 lobby of developing countries . the current eu proposal is 39 percent , although eu officials have said brussels could accept 51 percent .
" if we are going to move towards the g20 figures on tariffs - and we 're prepared to do that - the us is going to have to do the same on subsidies , " said an eu diplomat . washington and brussels agree on one thing : they want more concessions from the developing world on trade in services and manufactured goods . the specific target for the upcoming wto meetings is a deal on " modalities " - wto jargon for the mathematics for cutting subsidies and customs duties - a key step towards a final treaty . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 leaders end summit with focus on trade the leaders of the group of eight ended their three-day summit in russia with a push to salvage global free-trade talks that are teetering on the verge of collapse .

the crazy ruler , as many called him , commissioned the construction of castle after castle - whose grandiosity and splendor eventually led to his ruin . the most famous among king ludwig 's castle collection is neuschwanstein , located in southern bavaria .
this sightseeing must is high on the list of nearly every tourist to germany , which is why efforts have been made in the past few years to ease the flow of visitors with a new " traffic control " system . longs waits were the biggest complaint among castle guests , but administrator klaus peter scheck explained that things have changed : " when the visitor buys a ticket he receives an entry time and a tour time printed on the ticket , along with a tour number . " once a quiet retreat , now viewed by millions though waits have been shortened , visitors still have to take into account the 30 minute drive there , as the castle is perched on the top of a cliff 1,000 meters -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- high .

the crazy ruler , as many called him , commissioned the construction of castle after castle - whose grandiosity and splendor eventually led to his ruin . the most famous among king ludwig 's castle collection is neuschwanstein , located in southern bavaria .
this sightseeing must is high on the list of nearly every tourist to germany , which is why efforts have been made in the past few years to ease the flow of visitors with a new " traffic control " system . longs waits were the biggest complaint among castle guests , but administrator klaus peter scheck explained that things have changed : " when the visitor buys a ticket he receives an entry time and a tour time printed on the ticket , along with a tour number . " once a quiet retreat , now viewed by millions though waits have been shortened , visitors still have to take into account the 30 minute drive there , as the castle is perched on the top of a cliff 1,000 meters -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- high .

" i think what we 're all looking for now is to get beyond the rock , paper , scissors dynamic , " said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity . the talks have " so many moving parts " that everyone needs to shift at the same time to keep the machine moving forward , said the official . the geneva gathering , behind closed doors at the us mission in geneva , is scheduled to continue monday and be followed by further talks on july 28-29 . it comes in the wake of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit of leading powers in saint petersburg , russia . hopes for conclusion by year-end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 wants a resolution in the doha round talks the g8 , which comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states , and russia which is not a wto member , on july 16 had said that negotiators must within weeks thrash out the broad outlines of a deal and help steer the doha round to its conclusion by the end of the year . the following day , g8 leaders joined forces with counterparts from brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa to try to spur the doha round on . the negotiations began in capital of qatar in 2001 with the aim of producing an international treaty that would tear down trade barriers such as subsidies and customs duties and enable trade to improve living standards in developing countries . the round was meant to end in 2004 .
that target was later shifted to december 2006 because of persistent breakdowns . the talks have swung back and forth from collapse to revival , leaving behind a string of missed deadlines . rumors of a deal a so-called crunch session at the beginning of this month fizzled out without a breakthrough .
but rumors have been flying since the g8 summit that , behind closed doors , the leaders cut a deal to end the doha deadlock . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush offered deep subsidy cuts it has been suggested that us president george w. bush offered deeper cuts in washington 's farm subsidies , which according to critics skew trade in favor of agribusiness in the united states . in october , in what it billed as a bold move to jumpstart the doha round , washington offered to slash its payouts by 53 percent . other wto members were and are still unhappy , saying the proposal lacks bite and would leave the us room to spend around $ 22 billion - more than current payouts . there have been claims that during the g8 , bush offered to set a ceiling of $ 15 billion .
but several trade diplomats have dismissed the suggestion that the g8 leaders talked figures , with one saying it is based on " very wishful thinking . " deeper cuts would be a tough sell domestically for the us leader ahead of crucial mid-term elections in november . developing countries , meanwhile , also want the eu to reduce its customs duties on imports of agricultural goods . eu ready to bargain over tariffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson at the wto talks last month , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said that if others made the right moves , the eu was prepared to step " towards and close to " the 54-percent tariff cut demanded by brazil and india , which steer the powerful g20 lobby of developing countries . the current eu proposal is 39 percent , although eu officials have said brussels could accept 51 percent .
" if we are going to move towards the g20 figures on tariffs - and we 're prepared to do that - the us is going to have to do the same on subsidies , " said an eu diplomat . washington and brussels agree on one thing : they want more concessions from the developing world on trade in services and manufactured goods . the specific target for the upcoming wto meetings is a deal on " modalities " - wto jargon for the mathematics for cutting subsidies and customs duties - a key step towards a final treaty . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 leaders end summit with focus on trade the leaders of the group of eight ended their three-day summit in russia with a push to salvage global free-trade talks that are teetering on the verge of collapse .

" we can not allow extremist forces to define the agenda of the middle east , " steinmeier said .
" we must strive to stop extremist forces from wanting to broaden the scope of the conflict , " he said . " we are making all efforts to create the suitable conditions which will allow for a ceasefire , within a political framework aimed at reaching permanent stability in the region , " steinmeier said . israel launched its massive offensive on lebanon after the lebanese shiite group hezbollah captured two israeli soldiers in a border region on july 12 with the aim of securing a prisoner exchange . in 11 days , the conflict has killed more than 340 people in lebanon , more than 30 in israel , and forced upwards of half a million lebanese to flee their homes . complex ceasefire conditions but for his part abul gheit insisted that a prisoner swap should be part of these conditions and stressed the need for a ceasefire .
" a ceasefire is a principal and essential demand which we must concentrate on , " he said .
" reaching stability for a ceasefire must go hand in hand with certain procedures , including the swap . " israel has around 10,000 palestinian prisoners and an unknown number of lebanese in its jails .
hezbollah , like palestinian groups which snatched another soldier on june 25 , have demanded a prisoner swap with israel . germany and russia are trying to help israel secure the release of its soldiers in lebanon and the gaza strip , the german newspaper berliner zeitung reported on friday . the newspaper said the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- is trying to use its contacts within the two groups .

it is time for germany to do so again , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said thursday . steinmeier was just one of a number of top diplomats from europe who planned to converge on israel sunday ahead of a visit by us secretary of state condoleezza rice as world powers moved to try to end the lebanon conflict . european diplomatic frenzy the europeans are trying to push the jewish state into ending its massive blitz on lebanon , which has killed more than 350 people in 12 days , most of them civilians , and destroyed key infrastructure across the country . washington , israel 's closest ally , continues to staunchly defend the jewish state and argues that a ceasefire can only come as part of a wider diplomatic package involving the disarmament of the lebanese shiite muslim hezbollah . french foreign minister phillipe douste-blazy visited the northern city of haifa , which was hit again sunday by deadly rocket fire from hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste- blazy will meet israeli prime minister olmert douste-blazy was due to meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert later in the day , along with foreign minister tzipi livni , and palestinian president mahmud abbas in the west bank . " i am convinced that a ceasefire is possible , " douste-blazy said europeans face israel 's tough stance israel has rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire in its war against hezbollah .
" it 's too early to talk about a ceasefire , " immigration minister zeev boim said before a weekly cabinet meeting .
" we first have to reach the goals which we set , to rout hezbollah from southern lebanon . " olmert was also due to meet with german foreign minister steinmeier . britain 's junior foreign minister kim howells , due to meet livni and abbas on sunday , was also likely to push israel into easing its offensive that has also displaced more than a half million people and triggered warnings of a humanitarian catastrophe . the european diplomatic efforts are unlikely to succeed until the united states changes its position and also presses for a cessation in hostilities . washington argues that a ceasefire can come only as part of a diplomatic package that sees the disarmament of hezbollah , guarantees of israeli security on its northern border and an end to syrian and iranian backing of hezbollah . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign governments issue final evacuation orders in lebanon foreign governments stepped up efforts to evacuate their remaining nationals from lebanon on saturday amid mounting talk of an israeli ground offensive against its northern neighbor .

" we can not allow extremist forces to define the agenda of the middle east , " steinmeier said .
" we must strive to stop extremist forces from wanting to broaden the scope of the conflict , " he said . " we are making all efforts to create the suitable conditions which will allow for a ceasefire , within a political framework aimed at reaching permanent stability in the region , " steinmeier said . israel launched its massive offensive on lebanon after the lebanese shiite group hezbollah captured two israeli soldiers in a border region on july 12 with the aim of securing a prisoner exchange . in 11 days , the conflict has killed more than 340 people in lebanon , more than 30 in israel , and forced upwards of half a million lebanese to flee their homes . complex ceasefire conditions but for his part abul gheit insisted that a prisoner swap should be part of these conditions and stressed the need for a ceasefire .

" i could have gotten on a plane and rushed over and starting shuttling around and it would n't have been clear what i was shuttling to do , " rice said on friday . what she will not do , is accept rising demands from european and arab states for an immediate ceasefire in israel 's battle against hezbollah , regarding such a step as a " false promise " bound to simply incubate future conflicts . washington argues a ceasefire can come only as part of a diplomatic package that sees the disarmament of hezbollah , guarantees of israeli security at its northern border and an end to syrian and iranian backing of hezbollah . " secretary rice will make it clear that resolving the crisis demands confronting the terrorist group that launched the attacks and the nations that support it , " president george w. bush said saturday in his weekly radio address . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice is backed by her boss but faces widespread suspicion washington is taking a broad strategic view of the conflict , sparked when hezbollah abducted two israeli soldiers . it is therefore difficult to see the united states settling for any resolution in which hezbollah , syria and iran are not seen to have suffered a defeat . stalwart ally faltering but the us position appears to becoming increasingly lonely .
faithful us ally britain saturday criticized israel 's tactics , and even took a swipe at american strategy . the british junior foreign minister , kim howells , said in beirut : " i very much hope that the americans understand what 's happening to lebanon - the destruction of the infrastructure , the death of so many children and so many people . " rice will meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert and also see palestinian president mahmud abbas after arriving on monday . in rome , on wednesday , she will face desperate lebanese leaders , un officials and europeans demanding a ceasefire and arab allies who reportedly refused to host her visit , dismayed at us strategy . but some analysts said qualified progress remained possible . hopes for ceasefire follow rice " i do n't think the secretary of state would be going to the region unless they were fairly sure that she could accomplish something , " said steven cook , of the council on foreign relations .
" perhaps it 's the framework for the negotiation of a ceasefire . " jon alterman of the center for strategic and international studies agreed .
" i do n't think she would be having a meeting if she did n't know pretty well what the outcome would be , and that outcome i think is going to be a framework for future work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a possible un force may be part of rice 's plan for lebanon the eventual shape of a deal seems to be widely accepted and may include some kind of prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah , and possibly between israel and hamas in the parallel gaza conflict . an international force has been mooted to keep hezbollah and its rocket launchers out of southern lebanon and out of range of israel . but the devil looks to be in the timing . crisis not ready for a resolution neither israel nor hezbollah seem eager to stop fighting .
iran and syria may have no interest in containing it , and washington seems content for israel to continue pounding hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting continues with neither side willing to stop " there is no question that this -lrb- crisis -rrb- is not ripe for resolution at this particular moment , " said aaron david miller , a veteran us middle east peace negotiator now with the woodrow wilson center . the scope of us influence is also questioned . " they do n't have any leverage right now over the parties that hold the key to this crisis , iran , syria , the israelis , " said miller . the bush administration is also constrained in how much it can lean on israel , he added . " they are determined to maintain the moral clarity and consistency of their policy against terror , " said miller .

" i think what we 're all looking for now is to get beyond the rock , paper , scissors dynamic , " said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity . the talks have " so many moving parts " that everyone needs to shift at the same time to keep the machine moving forward , said the official . the geneva gathering , behind closed doors at the us mission in geneva , is scheduled to continue monday and be followed by further talks on july 28-29 . it comes in the wake of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit of leading powers in saint petersburg , russia . hopes for conclusion by year-end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 wants a resolution in the doha round talks the g8 , which comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states , and russia which is not a wto member , on july 16 had said that negotiators must within weeks thrash out the broad outlines of a deal and help steer the doha round to its conclusion by the end of the year . the following day , g8 leaders joined forces with counterparts from brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa to try to spur the doha round on . the negotiations began in capital of qatar in 2001 with the aim of producing an international treaty that would tear down trade barriers such as subsidies and customs duties and enable trade to improve living standards in developing countries . the round was meant to end in 2004 .
that target was later shifted to december 2006 because of persistent breakdowns . the talks have swung back and forth from collapse to revival , leaving behind a string of missed deadlines . rumors of a deal a so-called crunch session at the beginning of this month fizzled out without a breakthrough .
but rumors have been flying since the g8 summit that , behind closed doors , the leaders cut a deal to end the doha deadlock . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush offered deep subsidy cuts it has been suggested that us president george w. bush offered deeper cuts in washington 's farm subsidies , which according to critics skew trade in favor of agribusiness in the united states . in october , in what it billed as a bold move to jumpstart the doha round , washington offered to slash its payouts by 53 percent . other wto members were and are still unhappy , saying the proposal lacks bite and would leave the us room to spend around $ 22 billion - more than current payouts . there have been claims that during the g8 , bush offered to set a ceiling of $ 15 billion .

" i think what we 're all looking for now is to get beyond the rock , paper , scissors dynamic , " said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity . the talks have " so many moving parts " that everyone needs to shift at the same time to keep the machine moving forward , said the official . the geneva gathering , behind closed doors at the us mission in geneva , is scheduled to continue monday and be followed by further talks on july 28-29 . it comes in the wake of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit of leading powers in saint petersburg , russia . hopes for conclusion by year-end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 wants a resolution in the doha round talks the g8 , which comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states , and russia which is not a wto member , on july 16 had said that negotiators must within weeks thrash out the broad outlines of a deal and help steer the doha round to its conclusion by the end of the year . the following day , g8 leaders joined forces with counterparts from brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa to try to spur the doha round on . the negotiations began in capital of qatar in 2001 with the aim of producing an international treaty that would tear down trade barriers such as subsidies and customs duties and enable trade to improve living standards in developing countries . the round was meant to end in 2004 .
that target was later shifted to december 2006 because of persistent breakdowns . the talks have swung back and forth from collapse to revival , leaving behind a string of missed deadlines . rumors of a deal a so-called crunch session at the beginning of this month fizzled out without a breakthrough .
but rumors have been flying since the g8 summit that , behind closed doors , the leaders cut a deal to end the doha deadlock . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush offered deep subsidy cuts it has been suggested that us president george w. bush offered deeper cuts in washington 's farm subsidies , which according to critics skew trade in favor of agribusiness in the united states . in october , in what it billed as a bold move to jumpstart the doha round , washington offered to slash its payouts by 53 percent . other wto members were and are still unhappy , saying the proposal lacks bite and would leave the us room to spend around $ 22 billion - more than current payouts . there have been claims that during the g8 , bush offered to set a ceiling of $ 15 billion .
but several trade diplomats have dismissed the suggestion that the g8 leaders talked figures , with one saying it is based on " very wishful thinking . " deeper cuts would be a tough sell domestically for the us leader ahead of crucial mid-term elections in november . developing countries , meanwhile , also want the eu to reduce its customs duties on imports of agricultural goods . eu ready to bargain over tariffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson at the wto talks last month , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said that if others made the right moves , the eu was prepared to step " towards and close to " the 54-percent tariff cut demanded by brazil and india , which steer the powerful g20 lobby of developing countries . the current eu proposal is 39 percent , although eu officials have said brussels could accept 51 percent .

" i could have gotten on a plane and rushed over and starting shuttling around and it would n't have been clear what i was shuttling to do , " rice said on friday . what she will not do , is accept rising demands from european and arab states for an immediate ceasefire in israel 's battle against hezbollah , regarding such a step as a " false promise " bound to simply incubate future conflicts . washington argues a ceasefire can come only as part of a diplomatic package that sees the disarmament of hezbollah , guarantees of israeli security at its northern border and an end to syrian and iranian backing of hezbollah .

" we can not allow extremist forces to define the agenda of the middle east , " steinmeier said .
" we must strive to stop extremist forces from wanting to broaden the scope of the conflict , " he said . " we are making all efforts to create the suitable conditions which will allow for a ceasefire , within a political framework aimed at reaching permanent stability in the region , " steinmeier said . israel launched its massive offensive on lebanon after the lebanese shiite group hezbollah captured two israeli soldiers in a border region on july 12 with the aim of securing a prisoner exchange . in 11 days , the conflict has killed more than 340 people in lebanon , more than 30 in israel , and forced upwards of half a million lebanese to flee their homes . complex ceasefire conditions but for his part abul gheit insisted that a prisoner swap should be part of these conditions and stressed the need for a ceasefire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 23.07.2006 rice enters middle east arena with few friends for company großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters throughout the arab world blame the us for its support of israel 's campaign us secretary of state condoleezza rice embarks on a high-stakes middle east mission sunday , with the united states increasingly estranged from european and arab allies over the crisis . rice 's trip , for talks with the israeli and palestinian leaders , and an international conference on the crisis in rome , comes as more bloodshed in lebanon spurs mounting calls for a muscular us role to end the fighting . but her mission will bear little resemblance to the multi-day , multi-city middle east peace shuttles of some of her predecessors which are part of us diplomatic lore . " i could have gotten on a plane and rushed over and starting shuttling around and it would n't have been clear what i was shuttling to do , " rice said on friday . what she will not do , is accept rising demands from european and arab states for an immediate ceasefire in israel 's battle against hezbollah , regarding such a step as a " false promise " bound to simply incubate future conflicts . washington argues a ceasefire can come only as part of a diplomatic package that sees the disarmament of hezbollah , guarantees of israeli security at its northern border and an end to syrian and iranian backing of hezbollah . " secretary rice will make it clear that resolving the crisis demands confronting the terrorist group that launched the attacks and the nations that support it , " president george w. bush said saturday in his weekly radio address . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice is backed by her boss but faces widespread suspicion washington is taking a broad strategic view of the conflict , sparked when hezbollah abducted two israeli soldiers . it is therefore difficult to see the united states settling for any resolution in which hezbollah , syria and iran are not seen to have suffered a defeat . stalwart ally faltering but the us position appears to becoming increasingly lonely .
faithful us ally britain saturday criticized israel 's tactics , and even took a swipe at american strategy . the british junior foreign minister , kim howells , said in beirut : " i very much hope that the americans understand what 's happening to lebanon - the destruction of the infrastructure , the death of so many children and so many people . " rice will meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert and also see palestinian president mahmud abbas after arriving on monday . in rome , on wednesday , she will face desperate lebanese leaders , un officials and europeans demanding a ceasefire and arab allies who reportedly refused to host her visit , dismayed at us strategy . but some analysts said qualified progress remained possible . hopes for ceasefire follow rice " i do n't think the secretary of state would be going to the region unless they were fairly sure that she could accomplish something , " said steven cook , of the council on foreign relations .
" perhaps it 's the framework for the negotiation of a ceasefire . " jon alterman of the center for strategic and international studies agreed .
" i do n't think she would be having a meeting if she did n't know pretty well what the outcome would be , and that outcome i think is going to be a framework for future work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a possible un force may be part of rice 's plan for lebanon the eventual shape of a deal seems to be widely accepted and may include some kind of prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah , and possibly between israel and hamas in the parallel gaza conflict . an international force has been mooted to keep hezbollah and its rocket launchers out of southern lebanon and out of range of israel . but the devil looks to be in the timing . crisis not ready for a resolution neither israel nor hezbollah seem eager to stop fighting .
iran and syria may have no interest in containing it , and washington seems content for israel to continue pounding hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting continues with neither side willing to stop " there is no question that this -lrb- crisis -rrb- is not ripe for resolution at this particular moment , " said aaron david miller , a veteran us middle east peace negotiator now with the woodrow wilson center . the scope of us influence is also questioned . " they do n't have any leverage right now over the parties that hold the key to this crisis , iran , syria , the israelis , " said miller . the bush administration is also constrained in how much it can lean on israel , he added . " they are determined to maintain the moral clarity and consistency of their policy against terror , " said miller .

" i think what we 're all looking for now is to get beyond the rock , paper , scissors dynamic , " said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity . the talks have " so many moving parts " that everyone needs to shift at the same time to keep the machine moving forward , said the official . the geneva gathering , behind closed doors at the us mission in geneva , is scheduled to continue monday and be followed by further talks on july 28-29 . it comes in the wake of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit of leading powers in saint petersburg , russia . hopes for conclusion by year-end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 wants a resolution in the doha round talks the g8 , which comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states , and russia which is not a wto member , on july 16 had said that negotiators must within weeks thrash out the broad outlines of a deal and help steer the doha round to its conclusion by the end of the year . the following day , g8 leaders joined forces with counterparts from brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa to try to spur the doha round on . the negotiations began in capital of qatar in 2001 with the aim of producing an international treaty that would tear down trade barriers such as subsidies and customs duties and enable trade to improve living standards in developing countries . the round was meant to end in 2004 .
that target was later shifted to december 2006 because of persistent breakdowns . the talks have swung back and forth from collapse to revival , leaving behind a string of missed deadlines . rumors of a deal a so-called crunch session at the beginning of this month fizzled out without a breakthrough .
but rumors have been flying since the g8 summit that , behind closed doors , the leaders cut a deal to end the doha deadlock . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush offered deep subsidy cuts it has been suggested that us president george w. bush offered deeper cuts in washington 's farm subsidies , which according to critics skew trade in favor of agribusiness in the united states . in october , in what it billed as a bold move to jumpstart the doha round , washington offered to slash its payouts by 53 percent . other wto members were and are still unhappy , saying the proposal lacks bite and would leave the us room to spend around $ 22 billion - more than current payouts . there have been claims that during the g8 , bush offered to set a ceiling of $ 15 billion .
but several trade diplomats have dismissed the suggestion that the g8 leaders talked figures , with one saying it is based on " very wishful thinking . " deeper cuts would be a tough sell domestically for the us leader ahead of crucial mid-term elections in november . developing countries , meanwhile , also want the eu to reduce its customs duties on imports of agricultural goods . eu ready to bargain over tariffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson at the wto talks last month , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said that if others made the right moves , the eu was prepared to step " towards and close to " the 54-percent tariff cut demanded by brazil and india , which steer the powerful g20 lobby of developing countries . the current eu proposal is 39 percent , although eu officials have said brussels could accept 51 percent .
" if we are going to move towards the g20 figures on tariffs - and we 're prepared to do that - the us is going to have to do the same on subsidies , " said an eu diplomat . washington and brussels agree on one thing : they want more concessions from the developing world on trade in services and manufactured goods . the specific target for the upcoming wto meetings is a deal on " modalities " - wto jargon for the mathematics for cutting subsidies and customs duties - a key step towards a final treaty . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 leaders end summit with focus on trade the leaders of the group of eight ended their three-day summit in russia with a push to salvage global free-trade talks that are teetering on the verge of collapse .

" i think what we 're all looking for now is to get beyond the rock , paper , scissors dynamic , " said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity . the talks have " so many moving parts " that everyone needs to shift at the same time to keep the machine moving forward , said the official . the geneva gathering , behind closed doors at the us mission in geneva , is scheduled to continue monday and be followed by further talks on july 28-29 . it comes in the wake of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit of leading powers in saint petersburg , russia . hopes for conclusion by year-end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 wants a resolution in the doha round talks the g8 , which comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states , and russia which is not a wto member , on july 16 had said that negotiators must within weeks thrash out the broad outlines of a deal and help steer the doha round to its conclusion by the end of the year . the following day , g8 leaders joined forces with counterparts from brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa to try to spur the doha round on . the negotiations began in capital of qatar in 2001 with the aim of producing an international treaty that would tear down trade barriers such as subsidies and customs duties and enable trade to improve living standards in developing countries . the round was meant to end in 2004 .
that target was later shifted to december 2006 because of persistent breakdowns . the talks have swung back and forth from collapse to revival , leaving behind a string of missed deadlines . rumors of a deal a so-called crunch session at the beginning of this month fizzled out without a breakthrough .
but rumors have been flying since the g8 summit that , behind closed doors , the leaders cut a deal to end the doha deadlock . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush offered deep subsidy cuts it has been suggested that us president george w. bush offered deeper cuts in washington 's farm subsidies , which according to critics skew trade in favor of agribusiness in the united states . in october , in what it billed as a bold move to jumpstart the doha round , washington offered to slash its payouts by 53 percent . other wto members were and are still unhappy , saying the proposal lacks bite and would leave the us room to spend around $ 22 billion - more than current payouts . there have been claims that during the g8 , bush offered to set a ceiling of $ 15 billion .
but several trade diplomats have dismissed the suggestion that the g8 leaders talked figures , with one saying it is based on " very wishful thinking . " deeper cuts would be a tough sell domestically for the us leader ahead of crucial mid-term elections in november . developing countries , meanwhile , also want the eu to reduce its customs duties on imports of agricultural goods . eu ready to bargain over tariffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade chief peter mandelson at the wto talks last month , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said that if others made the right moves , the eu was prepared to step " towards and close to " the 54-percent tariff cut demanded by brazil and india , which steer the powerful g20 lobby of developing countries . the current eu proposal is 39 percent , although eu officials have said brussels could accept 51 percent .
" if we are going to move towards the g20 figures on tariffs - and we 're prepared to do that - the us is going to have to do the same on subsidies , " said an eu diplomat . washington and brussels agree on one thing : they want more concessions from the developing world on trade in services and manufactured goods . the specific target for the upcoming wto meetings is a deal on " modalities " - wto jargon for the mathematics for cutting subsidies and customs duties - a key step towards a final treaty . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 leaders end summit with focus on trade the leaders of the group of eight ended their three-day summit in russia with a push to salvage global free-trade talks that are teetering on the verge of collapse .

the crazy ruler , as many called him , commissioned the construction of castle after castle - whose grandiosity and splendor eventually led to his ruin . the most famous among king ludwig 's castle collection is neuschwanstein , located in southern bavaria .
this sightseeing must is high on the list of nearly every tourist to germany , which is why efforts have been made in the past few years to ease the flow of visitors with a new " traffic control " system . longs waits were the biggest complaint among castle guests , but administrator klaus peter scheck explained that things have changed : " when the visitor buys a ticket he receives an entry time and a tour time printed on the ticket , along with a tour number . " once a quiet retreat , now viewed by millions though waits have been shortened , visitors still have to take into account the 30 minute drive there , as the castle is perched on the top of a cliff 1,000 meters -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- high .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle attracts around 1.3 million tourists per year those who venture there will be well rewarded .
king ludwig 's aim was to build an " ideal castle , " based on old knights ' castles - a goal most would say he achieved . though it was meant as a place of quiet retreat for the mad king and not for the public , the neuschwanstein castle was opened to visitors shortly after his death in 1886 .
since that time , some 1.3 million people come each year to be dazzled by the gold and glitter , velvet and silk , kitsch and art that the castle has to offer . a room for richard wagner " there are around 90 rooms , 16 of which are fully restored , " described klaus peter scheck , " the most important room in the castle is the " sängersaal " -lrb- singers ' hall -rrb- .
art historians say it 's the reason why the castle was built in the first place . " the singers ' hall , ornamented with golden chandeliers , was dedicated to the composer richard wagner .
scenes from wagner 's operas , which are based on german mythology , adorn walls throughout the castle . king ludwig was not known for having a grip on reality , espcially the reality of his finances . the neuschwanstein castle overextended his financial resources .
in 1886 , the 40-year-old king was declared unfit and ejected from the throne .
shortly thereafter , he took his own life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion has changed a bit since king ludwig 's era a hi-tech castle from the beginning but the mad king 's fairy tale castle lives on - for as many as 6,000 visitors a day , in peak season . in addition to the tour appointment system , a new museum shop has been added to the site .
not only the usual knickknacks but also more intellectual items can be found there , like the bavarian castle administration 's publication . a solution to waiting in long lines at the museum shop has also been implemented : tech savvy visitors can order online at neuschwanstein 's own internet book shop . it 's only fitting that the castle should carry on ludwig 's hi-tech approach .
in those days , all the rooms were warmed via a hot-air central heating system and each floor had running water - modern luxuries back then . keeping up with the upkeep however , being built with up-to-date accouterments has n't kept the castle from aging over the years . " the biggest problem is the visitors themselves " because they bring moisture with them , admitted scheck .
" all the textiles and murals suffer from the moisture . " on the other hand , the fact that the castle has n't been heated in 130 years has minimized the damage , added the castle director .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be one of the next seven wonders of the world in addition to the visitors , mother nature also makes regular upkeep around the castle a necessity .
the cliffs that the castle rests on have to be continually reinforced because weather wears the limestone away . both regular maintenance and the latest major improvements have n't been cheap .

king ludwig 's aim was to build an " ideal castle , " based on old knights ' castles - a goal most would say he achieved . though it was meant as a place of quiet retreat for the mad king and not for the public , the neuschwanstein castle was opened to visitors shortly after his death in 1886 .
since that time , some 1.3 million people come each year to be dazzled by the gold and glitter , velvet and silk , kitsch and art that the castle has to offer . a room for richard wagner " there are around 90 rooms , 16 of which are fully restored , " described klaus peter scheck , " the most important room in the castle is the " sängersaal " -lrb- singers ' hall -rrb- .
art historians say it 's the reason why the castle was built in the first place . " the singers ' hall , ornamented with golden chandeliers , was dedicated to the composer richard wagner .
scenes from wagner 's operas , which are based on german mythology , adorn walls throughout the castle . king ludwig was not known for having a grip on reality , espcially the reality of his finances . the neuschwanstein castle overextended his financial resources .
in 1886 , the 40-year-old king was declared unfit and ejected from the throne .
shortly thereafter , he took his own life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion has changed a bit since king ludwig 's era a hi-tech castle from the beginning but the mad king 's fairy tale castle lives on - for as many as 6,000 visitors a day , in peak season . in addition to the tour appointment system , a new museum shop has been added to the site .
not only the usual knickknacks but also more intellectual items can be found there , like the bavarian castle administration 's publication . a solution to waiting in long lines at the museum shop has also been implemented : tech savvy visitors can order online at neuschwanstein 's own internet book shop . it 's only fitting that the castle should carry on ludwig 's hi-tech approach .
in those days , all the rooms were warmed via a hot-air central heating system and each floor had running water - modern luxuries back then . keeping up with the upkeep however , being built with up-to-date accouterments has n't kept the castle from aging over the years . " the biggest problem is the visitors themselves " because they bring moisture with them , admitted scheck .
" all the textiles and murals suffer from the moisture . " on the other hand , the fact that the castle has n't been heated in 130 years has minimized the damage , added the castle director .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be one of the next seven wonders of the world in addition to the visitors , mother nature also makes regular upkeep around the castle a necessity .
the cliffs that the castle rests on have to be continually reinforced because weather wears the limestone away . both regular maintenance and the latest major improvements have n't been cheap .
the state of bavaria has spent 11 million euros -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in the last 15 years on renovations and the new " traffic control " system for visitors .
that may sound like a lot , but neuschwanstein is also a good source of income . the next world wonder ? what 's more , the investment may be rewarded with something priceless : a coveted " seven wonders of the world " title . a former unesco staff member came up with idea to revise the long-standing list of wonders and a committee of experts selected 21 cultural sites throughout the world , including neuschwanstein .
until july 2007 , anyone can place their vote for the bavarian castle by visiting www.neuschwanstein.de. neuschwanstein as one of the next wonders of the world ?
maybe it 's a bit crazy - but king ludwig certainly would have like the idea . gaby reucher -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neuschwanstein : mad ludwig 's magical refuge from reality no visit to germany would be complete without seeing the castle that inspired disney 's magical kingdom .

" we can not allow extremist forces to define the agenda of the middle east , " steinmeier said .
" we must strive to stop extremist forces from wanting to broaden the scope of the conflict , " he said . " we are making all efforts to create the suitable conditions which will allow for a ceasefire , within a political framework aimed at reaching permanent stability in the region , " steinmeier said . israel launched its massive offensive on lebanon after the lebanese shiite group hezbollah captured two israeli soldiers in a border region on july 12 with the aim of securing a prisoner exchange . in 11 days , the conflict has killed more than 340 people in lebanon , more than 30 in israel , and forced upwards of half a million lebanese to flee their homes . complex ceasefire conditions but for his part abul gheit insisted that a prisoner swap should be part of these conditions and stressed the need for a ceasefire .
" a ceasefire is a principal and essential demand which we must concentrate on , " he said .
" reaching stability for a ceasefire must go hand in hand with certain procedures , including the swap . " israel has around 10,000 palestinian prisoners and an unknown number of lebanese in its jails .

it is time for germany to do so again , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said thursday . steinmeier was just one of a number of top diplomats from europe who planned to converge on israel sunday ahead of a visit by us secretary of state condoleezza rice as world powers moved to try to end the lebanon conflict . european diplomatic frenzy the europeans are trying to push the jewish state into ending its massive blitz on lebanon , which has killed more than 350 people in 12 days , most of them civilians , and destroyed key infrastructure across the country . washington , israel 's closest ally , continues to staunchly defend the jewish state and argues that a ceasefire can only come as part of a wider diplomatic package involving the disarmament of the lebanese shiite muslim hezbollah . french foreign minister phillipe douste-blazy visited the northern city of haifa , which was hit again sunday by deadly rocket fire from hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste- blazy will meet israeli prime minister olmert douste-blazy was due to meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert later in the day , along with foreign minister tzipi livni , and palestinian president mahmud abbas in the west bank . " i am convinced that a ceasefire is possible , " douste-blazy said europeans face israel 's tough stance israel has rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire in its war against hezbollah .
" it 's too early to talk about a ceasefire , " immigration minister zeev boim said before a weekly cabinet meeting .
" we first have to reach the goals which we set , to rout hezbollah from southern lebanon . " olmert was also due to meet with german foreign minister steinmeier . britain 's junior foreign minister kim howells , due to meet livni and abbas on sunday , was also likely to push israel into easing its offensive that has also displaced more than a half million people and triggered warnings of a humanitarian catastrophe . the european diplomatic efforts are unlikely to succeed until the united states changes its position and also presses for a cessation in hostilities . washington argues that a ceasefire can come only as part of a diplomatic package that sees the disarmament of hezbollah , guarantees of israeli security on its northern border and an end to syrian and iranian backing of hezbollah . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign governments issue final evacuation orders in lebanon foreign governments stepped up efforts to evacuate their remaining nationals from lebanon on saturday amid mounting talk of an israeli ground offensive against its northern neighbor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.07.2006 preserving endangered species of the german language großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tradition is big for ethnic germans in russia , as chancellor merkel saw in tomsk in april people are usually most comfortable when speaking in their mother tongue .
but that 's not always the case , as german minorities in eastern europe and central asia show . finding german dialects in eastern europe is getting increasingly difficult as they no longer serve as a means of communication .
that 's why they 've become a sought-after research objects for linguists such as hermann scheuriger and alfred wildfeuer . the two men said that traveling to ukraine feels like traveling back in time .
about 3,000 to 5,000 people in the western part of the country , in transcarpatia , still speak old german dialects today .
franconian and bohemian german can be found here as well as a dialect from austria 's salzkammergut region . not that germans in transcarpatia would be aware of these differences . " they did n't know that they were speaking a bavarian or a frankonian dialect , " scheuriger said .
" they call their language ' swobisch , ' even though it has nothing to do with swabian . " vanishing " language islands " linguists today conserve surviving german dialects in ukraine , kazakhstan and russia on tape .
there 's not much time left , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most young ethnic germans came to germany after 1990 and attended language classes german " language islands , " meaning that the language was spoken in several nearby villages , " are no longer there , " said nina berend , a linguists who grew up in siberia and now lives in germany .
berend added that most people left after the fall of communism . " they have emigrated to germany , " she said . as a result , german dialects are rapidly disappearing .
linguist alfred wildfeuer said that some dialects wo n't be spoken in ukraine any more in the near future . " the youngest speaker of bohemian german that we encountered was 45 , " he said .
" it seems like that there are almost no children , who grow up with this dialect . " presenting a modern view of germany germany 's cultural institute , the goethe institute , is trying to preserve the dialects .
it offers language courses for those that no longer speak german as well as cultural events that are meant to offer a current view of germany to people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to modern germany than brass ensembles but ethnic germans in russia , kazakhstan and ukraine not only speak old dialects - they are also attached to an antiquated view of germany . " they are mainly interested in folklore , national costumes and flags , " said werner jost , who works for the goethe institute .

but that 's not always the case , as german minorities in eastern europe and central asia show . finding german dialects in eastern europe is getting increasingly difficult as they no longer serve as a means of communication .
that 's why they 've become a sought-after research objects for linguists such as hermann scheuriger and alfred wildfeuer . the two men said that traveling to ukraine feels like traveling back in time .
about 3,000 to 5,000 people in the western part of the country , in transcarpatia , still speak old german dialects today .
franconian and bohemian german can be found here as well as a dialect from austria 's salzkammergut region . not that germans in transcarpatia would be aware of these differences . " they did n't know that they were speaking a bavarian or a frankonian dialect , " scheuriger said .
" they call their language ' swobisch , ' even though it has nothing to do with swabian . " vanishing " language islands " linguists today conserve surviving german dialects in ukraine , kazakhstan and russia on tape .
there 's not much time left , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most young ethnic germans came to germany after 1990 and attended language classes german " language islands , " meaning that the language was spoken in several nearby villages , " are no longer there , " said nina berend , a linguists who grew up in siberia and now lives in germany .
berend added that most people left after the fall of communism . " they have emigrated to germany , " she said . as a result , german dialects are rapidly disappearing .
linguist alfred wildfeuer said that some dialects wo n't be spoken in ukraine any more in the near future . " the youngest speaker of bohemian german that we encountered was 45 , " he said .
" it seems like that there are almost no children , who grow up with this dialect . " presenting a modern view of germany germany 's cultural institute , the goethe institute , is trying to preserve the dialects .
it offers language courses for those that no longer speak german as well as cultural events that are meant to offer a current view of germany to people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to modern germany than brass ensembles but ethnic germans in russia , kazakhstan and ukraine not only speak old dialects - they are also attached to an antiquated view of germany . " they are mainly interested in folklore , national costumes and flags , " said werner jost , who works for the goethe institute .
" they care about dances , songs and similar things that help them find their identity .
we do n't think that 's enough .
we think that identity that has a future is something else and try to guide them there . " learning to profit from bilingual skills living between two cultures and languages is almost always very difficult for people .
eleonara hummel , a writer , spent her youth in kazakhstan and later moved to dresden with her parents .
her work is now influenced by the experience of growing up in two different worlds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden has few similarities with cities in kazakhstan " i 've learned to appreciate the fact that i can draw from a fund that not everyone has , " she said .
" it took a while to get to this point .
only in the last couple of years , i 've stopped thinking : ' why could i not have been someone else ? '
i 've accepted it and am content . " only few people manage to see their ability to speak german as a chance while living in russia , ukraine or kazakhstan .
but some are now profiting from their bilingual skills . " an austrian ski producer has a factory in ukraine , " wildfeuer said .
" it was clearly an advantage for some to speak german already .

" i could have gotten on a plane and rushed over and starting shuttling around and it would n't have been clear what i was shuttling to do , " rice said on friday . what she will not do , is accept rising demands from european and arab states for an immediate ceasefire in israel 's battle against hezbollah , regarding such a step as a " false promise " bound to simply incubate future conflicts . washington argues a ceasefire can come only as part of a diplomatic package that sees the disarmament of hezbollah , guarantees of israeli security at its northern border and an end to syrian and iranian backing of hezbollah . " secretary rice will make it clear that resolving the crisis demands confronting the terrorist group that launched the attacks and the nations that support it , " president george w. bush said saturday in his weekly radio address . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice is backed by her boss but faces widespread suspicion washington is taking a broad strategic view of the conflict , sparked when hezbollah abducted two israeli soldiers . it is therefore difficult to see the united states settling for any resolution in which hezbollah , syria and iran are not seen to have suffered a defeat . stalwart ally faltering but the us position appears to becoming increasingly lonely .
faithful us ally britain saturday criticized israel 's tactics , and even took a swipe at american strategy . the british junior foreign minister , kim howells , said in beirut : " i very much hope that the americans understand what 's happening to lebanon - the destruction of the infrastructure , the death of so many children and so many people . " rice will meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert and also see palestinian president mahmud abbas after arriving on monday . in rome , on wednesday , she will face desperate lebanese leaders , un officials and europeans demanding a ceasefire and arab allies who reportedly refused to host her visit , dismayed at us strategy . but some analysts said qualified progress remained possible . hopes for ceasefire follow rice " i do n't think the secretary of state would be going to the region unless they were fairly sure that she could accomplish something , " said steven cook , of the council on foreign relations .
" perhaps it 's the framework for the negotiation of a ceasefire . " jon alterman of the center for strategic and international studies agreed .
" i do n't think she would be having a meeting if she did n't know pretty well what the outcome would be , and that outcome i think is going to be a framework for future work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a possible un force may be part of rice 's plan for lebanon the eventual shape of a deal seems to be widely accepted and may include some kind of prisoner swap between israel and hezbollah , and possibly between israel and hamas in the parallel gaza conflict . an international force has been mooted to keep hezbollah and its rocket launchers out of southern lebanon and out of range of israel . but the devil looks to be in the timing . crisis not ready for a resolution neither israel nor hezbollah seem eager to stop fighting .
iran and syria may have no interest in containing it , and washington seems content for israel to continue pounding hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting continues with neither side willing to stop " there is no question that this -lrb- crisis -rrb- is not ripe for resolution at this particular moment , " said aaron david miller , a veteran us middle east peace negotiator now with the woodrow wilson center . the scope of us influence is also questioned . " they do n't have any leverage right now over the parties that hold the key to this crisis , iran , syria , the israelis , " said miller . the bush administration is also constrained in how much it can lean on israel , he added . " they are determined to maintain the moral clarity and consistency of their policy against terror , " said miller .
" israel is on the right side of that line , hezbollah , plus iran and syria are on the wrong side .

it does n't matter whether it is punk , hip hop or black metal - anything is better than the right fringe .
the club offers information , holds discussions and workshops keeping in mind , the style , music and political background of the diverse youth movements . a record as a tool it is dj training class at a special school for the learning-disabled in blankenhain in the eastern german state of thuringia .
and instead of math homework , the students sit curious before two turntables .
peer wiechmann shows the students how to lay a record down and find the right beat . " you take your hand and lay the record , here and there , " he tells the kids .
" at first , try to be relatively even so that you produce a real beat .
and after you feel more secure , try and lay another down and get another beat to overlay on the first . " everyone gets a change to try it .
bastian , 14 , is really getting into it .
" it is really interesting to do it yourself , " he said .
" and also to get tips and learn something new from someone with experience . weichmann answers all the kids questions , shows tricks .
but he also knows that he is no dj . youth culture is tolerant wiechmann comes from the weimar-based network against rightwing extremism who issued the contract for the event .
afterward , he picked up his team in berlin on the way to blankenhain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project aims to engage young people in meaninful discussions " we have a strong sense of camaraderie and commitment , " he said .
" and we try to capture the children through music and dance .
youth culture is essentially by its nature tolerant , diverse and international .
that is what we communicate and everyone seems to like that . " culture on the road is a colourful team of 15 young people .
several members of the group have studied political science and are especially familiar with right-wing extremist ideology .
others come from different youth scenes such as hip hop , techno or metal .
an american member of the group played in a punk band for years .
she offers day-long workshops with music . in the east , hating foreigners is normal silke baer is responsible for the concept .
she wants with the project above all to reach those young people in the new eastern german states , where she says that the group has learned through experience that " seeing foreigners as the enemy is an absolutely normal thing . " " we go into this region and talk with kids about youth culture through political discussions , " she said .
" in this way , we try to bring them closer into the democratic fold . " that most youth culture comes from abroad is one point , she says .
another is the history of such movements .
for example , hardly any kids know that the punk movement of the 1970s arose out of the high unemployment in the younger ranks in the uk .
this is something that baer knows only too well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : culture is one way to reach those hard-to-reach young people sociologist michaela glaser from the german youth institute in halle says that these types of youth projects are indispensable . " the important thing is that there is first access to the young in order to be able to work with them , " she said .
" and it is just these projects , in our experience , that help the young become more open and be ready for future conflicts . " not a one-time thing and it is also important to be consistent and not have such projects be a one-time occurrence otherwise they will be in vain , said glaser .
that is a danger in many communities with empty cash registers who have already stricken youth programs from their tight budgets . corinna hundshagen , the director of the blankenhain school says that her staff wants to remain on the ball . " i have already spoken to peer weichmann and requested that at the very least , he should remain in contact , " she said .
" we want to do certain projects still with our local youth club .
we have made a start and now we have to see how we can move forward .

" we can not allow extremist forces to define the agenda of the middle east , " steinmeier said .
" we must strive to stop extremist forces from wanting to broaden the scope of the conflict , " he said . " we are making all efforts to create the suitable conditions which will allow for a ceasefire , within a political framework aimed at reaching permanent stability in the region , " steinmeier said . israel launched its massive offensive on lebanon after the lebanese shiite group hezbollah captured two israeli soldiers in a border region on july 12 with the aim of securing a prisoner exchange . in 11 days , the conflict has killed more than 340 people in lebanon , more than 30 in israel , and forced upwards of half a million lebanese to flee their homes . complex ceasefire conditions but for his part abul gheit insisted that a prisoner swap should be part of these conditions and stressed the need for a ceasefire .
" a ceasefire is a principal and essential demand which we must concentrate on , " he said .
" reaching stability for a ceasefire must go hand in hand with certain procedures , including the swap . " israel has around 10,000 palestinian prisoners and an unknown number of lebanese in its jails .
hezbollah , like palestinian groups which snatched another soldier on june 25 , have demanded a prisoner swap with israel . germany and russia are trying to help israel secure the release of its soldiers in lebanon and the gaza strip , the german newspaper berliner zeitung reported on friday . the newspaper said the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- is trying to use its contacts within the two groups .
the head of the bnd , ernst uhrlau , in 2004 supervised a prisoner exchange between israel and hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , and egypt 's ahmed aboul gheit " the german government has in the past played a very constructive role in resolving hostage crises or the kidnapping of soldiers .
it is time for germany to do so again , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said thursday . steinmeier was just one of a number of top diplomats from europe who planned to converge on israel sunday ahead of a visit by us secretary of state condoleezza rice as world powers moved to try to end the lebanon conflict . european diplomatic frenzy the europeans are trying to push the jewish state into ending its massive blitz on lebanon , which has killed more than 350 people in 12 days , most of them civilians , and destroyed key infrastructure across the country . washington , israel 's closest ally , continues to staunchly defend the jewish state and argues that a ceasefire can only come as part of a wider diplomatic package involving the disarmament of the lebanese shiite muslim hezbollah . french foreign minister phillipe douste-blazy visited the northern city of haifa , which was hit again sunday by deadly rocket fire from hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste- blazy will meet israeli prime minister olmert douste-blazy was due to meet israeli prime minister ehud olmert later in the day , along with foreign minister tzipi livni , and palestinian president mahmud abbas in the west bank . " i am convinced that a ceasefire is possible , " douste-blazy said europeans face israel 's tough stance israel has rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire in its war against hezbollah .
" it 's too early to talk about a ceasefire , " immigration minister zeev boim said before a weekly cabinet meeting .
" we first have to reach the goals which we set , to rout hezbollah from southern lebanon . " olmert was also due to meet with german foreign minister steinmeier . britain 's junior foreign minister kim howells , due to meet livni and abbas on sunday , was also likely to push israel into easing its offensive that has also displaced more than a half million people and triggered warnings of a humanitarian catastrophe . the european diplomatic efforts are unlikely to succeed until the united states changes its position and also presses for a cessation in hostilities . washington argues that a ceasefire can come only as part of a diplomatic package that sees the disarmament of hezbollah , guarantees of israeli security on its northern border and an end to syrian and iranian backing of hezbollah . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign governments issue final evacuation orders in lebanon foreign governments stepped up efforts to evacuate their remaining nationals from lebanon on saturday amid mounting talk of an israeli ground offensive against its northern neighbor .

he talked with dw-world.de about his career as steinway & sons chief piano technician . franz mohr has a way of endearing himself to everyone he comes into contact with .
in his 30-year career as a piano technician for piano greats like vladimir horowitz , arthur rubenstein and glenn gould , mohr became more than just a highly valued tuner : he was also a friend and confident to the pianists he worked with . this was part of the success he had as steinway 's chief piano technician - a job that meant tempering not only grand pianos , but also dealing with the often unpredictable temperaments of the world famous artists who performed on them . 79-year-old mohr is a native of düren , germany , where he and his parents miraculously survived severe allied bombings in 1944 .
after training to be a piano technician in germany , he immigrated to new york in 1962 to accept a job with steinway & sons .
three years later , he became the piano maker 's chief piano technician , a role he took over from legendary tuner bill hupfer . dw-world.de : mr. mohr , how did your relationship to music begin ? franz mohr : i grew up with music .
i went to the hochschule für musik in cologne where i studied the violin .
then i developed tremendous physical problems with my left wrist .
it was terrible .
i had to take breaks and visited all kinds of doctors and finally had to come to the very painful decision that i could n't become a performing artist but had to do something else with my life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classic i saw an ad in a german music magazine that rudolf ibach sohn - the oldest piano manufacturing company in germany , founded in 1774 - was looking for apprentices .
i was already 24 years old at that time , but i thought , this also has something to do with music - why do n't i try it ?
they accepted me and i just loved working with my hands and learning about all the phases of piano building . the ultimate dream in the music world - at least as a piano technician - is steinway .
around 1954 , i applied for a job as a concert piano tuner for a concert management company in duesseldorf , which was also a steinway dealer .
and i got the job !
for the first time , i started to work on steinways and i really fell in love with them , both as a technician and as a musician . what is special about steinway pianos ? not only the design of a the piano , but also the quality of wood which goes into the piano are very important - especially when it comes to the sound board .
with this quality of wood you have a tremendously wide spectrum of tone colors . all the other instruments are mass produced , including yamaha - nothing against yamaha , but they build over 800 pianos a day and they have to use any kind of wood they come across .
their soundboard is , for instance , much thicker .
that counts for brilliance , which you need in any piano , but nothing else .
you play a pianissimo and it 's still too loud . we build steinways in two factories , in hamburg and new york , and we build 13 pianos a day .
that is the difference .
a steinway piano gets better and better all the time because of the quality of wood we use . in 1962 , you accepted a job as a piano technician with steinway & sons in new york .
did you have any difficulties adjusting to american culture when you came ? no , of course not .
we fell in love with america .
let me tell you a story : i 'd worked for many great artists in germany and had tuned for rudolf serkin there and in america .
the first thing he said to me when i visited him in vermont to work on his three concert grand pianos was , " franz , now we are in america where things are not so complicated .
now you can call me rudy . "
until that time he had always been " herr professor " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir horowitz when your predecessor bill hupfer retired in 1965 you took his position as chief piano technician .
at that point , you began working with vladimir horowitz , who you toured with and tuned for until his sudden death in 1989 .
what was horowitz like as a person ? of course , he was difficult and had a very complex personality .
you never knew when he would blow up and scream and whatever .
it took a long time before we really became such good friends .
many times before a concert he would say , " franz , you are the most important person here ! " horowitz was an accomplished steinway artist in russia when he was 19 years old .
when he ran away from russia " with a thousand rubles in his shoes " , as he always said , he came to berlin .
and immediately all the german piano companies - bösendorf , bechstein , blühtner - they all wanted him to try their pianos so he would play their product .
he tried them all , but there was never any doubt in his mind about steinway . after his death , i still traveled with his piano .
we will take the horowitz piano to japan soon and i 'm going with the piano . who else played horowitz 's piano ? in his lifetime , only one person .
that was murray perahia .
he was flabbergasted , of course , that horowitz let him play it .
but after the first piece he came back and said , " franz , i 'm sorry but i can not handle it . " each steinway is different - it feels different and sound different .
and each artist has different requirements .
horowitz died and we wanted to send the piano on tour .
but i was so afraid : who would be able to manage that piano ?
i did have to change a few things , but people just love it . what was it like to tour with horowitz ? it was wonderful !
horowitz only played on sundays and the rehearsals were always saturdays and the rest of the week i could go sightseeing .
he said , " franz bring your wife and your children , i 'll pay . "
i knew exactly what he wanted in the piano and it was a wonderful relationship - i was part of the family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glenn gould as soon as you arrived in the us in 1962 , you had the chance to work with glenn gould , who was known for being somewhat eccentric .
how did you get along with him ? my predecessor , bill hupfer , had recording session at the famous 30th street columbia record studio where he tuned for glenn gould .
he fell into disgrace with glenn gould and i had been in america for just a few days . bill should have known better : he went to glenn just before the recording session , put his hand on his shoulder , and asked him how he was doing .
later glenn claimed his shoulder had been dislocated because the tuner had slapped him on the shoulder , which was n't true .
he had to cancel concerts and had a lawsuit with steinway . bill could n't tune for him anymore , so i was sent by steinway to take care of glenn gould .
over the years we became very good friends .
i went nearly every month to toronto to do his recording in the later years .
he knew that i would come to toronto with rubenstein or horowitz or serkin and he would never go to anyone 's concert .
but he knew that i was coming and he would pick me up at the airport and make sure we spent the evening together , listening to recordings and talking . you know so many of the top pianists from the 20th century - both musically and personally .
do you see any patterns ?
what makes them great ? in german we call it " ausstrahlung " - a presence , a communication from the stage to the people , which many people do not have .
if you have this , it does n't even matter if you play a lot of wrong notes .
of course , rubenstein , horowitz and serkin had this . franz mohr lives in new york and , though nearing 80 , he still travels regularly as a piano technician , teacher and lecturer .
he currently tours with italian pianist mauricio pollini .

he fell into disgrace with glenn gould and i had been in america for just a few days . bill should have known better : he went to glenn just before the recording session , put his hand on his shoulder , and asked him how he was doing .
later glenn claimed his shoulder had been dislocated because the tuner had slapped him on the shoulder , which was n't true .
he had to cancel concerts and had a lawsuit with steinway . bill could n't tune for him anymore , so i was sent by steinway to take care of glenn gould .

he talked with dw-world.de about his career as steinway & sons chief piano technician . franz mohr has a way of endearing himself to everyone he comes into contact with .
in his 30-year career as a piano technician for piano greats like vladimir horowitz , arthur rubenstein and glenn gould , mohr became more than just a highly valued tuner : he was also a friend and confident to the pianists he worked with . this was part of the success he had as steinway 's chief piano technician - a job that meant tempering not only grand pianos , but also dealing with the often unpredictable temperaments of the world famous artists who performed on them . 79-year-old mohr is a native of düren , germany , where he and his parents miraculously survived severe allied bombings in 1944 .
after training to be a piano technician in germany , he immigrated to new york in 1962 to accept a job with steinway & sons .
three years later , he became the piano maker 's chief piano technician , a role he took over from legendary tuner bill hupfer . dw-world.de : mr. mohr , how did your relationship to music begin ? franz mohr : i grew up with music .
i went to the hochschule für musik in cologne where i studied the violin .
then i developed tremendous physical problems with my left wrist .
it was terrible .
i had to take breaks and visited all kinds of doctors and finally had to come to the very painful decision that i could n't become a performing artist but had to do something else with my life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classic i saw an ad in a german music magazine that rudolf ibach sohn - the oldest piano manufacturing company in germany , founded in 1774 - was looking for apprentices .
i was already 24 years old at that time , but i thought , this also has something to do with music - why do n't i try it ?
they accepted me and i just loved working with my hands and learning about all the phases of piano building . the ultimate dream in the music world - at least as a piano technician - is steinway .
around 1954 , i applied for a job as a concert piano tuner for a concert management company in duesseldorf , which was also a steinway dealer .
and i got the job !
for the first time , i started to work on steinways and i really fell in love with them , both as a technician and as a musician . what is special about steinway pianos ? not only the design of a the piano , but also the quality of wood which goes into the piano are very important - especially when it comes to the sound board .
with this quality of wood you have a tremendously wide spectrum of tone colors . all the other instruments are mass produced , including yamaha - nothing against yamaha , but they build over 800 pianos a day and they have to use any kind of wood they come across .
their soundboard is , for instance , much thicker .
that counts for brilliance , which you need in any piano , but nothing else .
you play a pianissimo and it 's still too loud . we build steinways in two factories , in hamburg and new york , and we build 13 pianos a day .
that is the difference .
a steinway piano gets better and better all the time because of the quality of wood we use . in 1962 , you accepted a job as a piano technician with steinway & sons in new york .
did you have any difficulties adjusting to american culture when you came ? no , of course not .
we fell in love with america .
let me tell you a story : i 'd worked for many great artists in germany and had tuned for rudolf serkin there and in america .
the first thing he said to me when i visited him in vermont to work on his three concert grand pianos was , " franz , now we are in america where things are not so complicated .
now you can call me rudy . "
until that time he had always been " herr professor " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir horowitz when your predecessor bill hupfer retired in 1965 you took his position as chief piano technician .
at that point , you began working with vladimir horowitz , who you toured with and tuned for until his sudden death in 1989 .
what was horowitz like as a person ? of course , he was difficult and had a very complex personality .
you never knew when he would blow up and scream and whatever .
it took a long time before we really became such good friends .
many times before a concert he would say , " franz , you are the most important person here ! " horowitz was an accomplished steinway artist in russia when he was 19 years old .
when he ran away from russia " with a thousand rubles in his shoes " , as he always said , he came to berlin .
and immediately all the german piano companies - bösendorf , bechstein , blühtner - they all wanted him to try their pianos so he would play their product .
he tried them all , but there was never any doubt in his mind about steinway . after his death , i still traveled with his piano .
we will take the horowitz piano to japan soon and i 'm going with the piano . who else played horowitz 's piano ? in his lifetime , only one person .
that was murray perahia .
he was flabbergasted , of course , that horowitz let him play it .
but after the first piece he came back and said , " franz , i 'm sorry but i can not handle it . " each steinway is different - it feels different and sound different .
and each artist has different requirements .
horowitz died and we wanted to send the piano on tour .
but i was so afraid : who would be able to manage that piano ?
i did have to change a few things , but people just love it . what was it like to tour with horowitz ? it was wonderful !
horowitz only played on sundays and the rehearsals were always saturdays and the rest of the week i could go sightseeing .

you play a pianissimo and it 's still too loud . we build steinways in two factories , in hamburg and new york , and we build 13 pianos a day .
that is the difference .
a steinway piano gets better and better all the time because of the quality of wood we use . in 1962 , you accepted a job as a piano technician with steinway & sons in new york .
did you have any difficulties adjusting to american culture when you came ? no , of course not .
we fell in love with america .
let me tell you a story : i 'd worked for many great artists in germany and had tuned for rudolf serkin there and in america .
the first thing he said to me when i visited him in vermont to work on his three concert grand pianos was , " franz , now we are in america where things are not so complicated .
now you can call me rudy . "
until that time he had always been " herr professor " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir horowitz when your predecessor bill hupfer retired in 1965 you took his position as chief piano technician .
at that point , you began working with vladimir horowitz , who you toured with and tuned for until his sudden death in 1989 .
what was horowitz like as a person ? of course , he was difficult and had a very complex personality .
you never knew when he would blow up and scream and whatever .
it took a long time before we really became such good friends .
many times before a concert he would say , " franz , you are the most important person here ! " horowitz was an accomplished steinway artist in russia when he was 19 years old .
when he ran away from russia " with a thousand rubles in his shoes " , as he always said , he came to berlin .
and immediately all the german piano companies - bösendorf , bechstein , blühtner - they all wanted him to try their pianos so he would play their product .
he tried them all , but there was never any doubt in his mind about steinway . after his death , i still traveled with his piano .
we will take the horowitz piano to japan soon and i 'm going with the piano . who else played horowitz 's piano ? in his lifetime , only one person .
that was murray perahia .
he was flabbergasted , of course , that horowitz let him play it .
but after the first piece he came back and said , " franz , i 'm sorry but i can not handle it . " each steinway is different - it feels different and sound different .
and each artist has different requirements .
horowitz died and we wanted to send the piano on tour .
but i was so afraid : who would be able to manage that piano ?
i did have to change a few things , but people just love it . what was it like to tour with horowitz ? it was wonderful !
horowitz only played on sundays and the rehearsals were always saturdays and the rest of the week i could go sightseeing .
he said , " franz bring your wife and your children , i 'll pay . "
i knew exactly what he wanted in the piano and it was a wonderful relationship - i was part of the family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glenn gould as soon as you arrived in the us in 1962 , you had the chance to work with glenn gould , who was known for being somewhat eccentric .
how did you get along with him ? my predecessor , bill hupfer , had recording session at the famous 30th street columbia record studio where he tuned for glenn gould .
he fell into disgrace with glenn gould and i had been in america for just a few days . bill should have known better : he went to glenn just before the recording session , put his hand on his shoulder , and asked him how he was doing .
later glenn claimed his shoulder had been dislocated because the tuner had slapped him on the shoulder , which was n't true .
he had to cancel concerts and had a lawsuit with steinway . bill could n't tune for him anymore , so i was sent by steinway to take care of glenn gould .
over the years we became very good friends .
i went nearly every month to toronto to do his recording in the later years .
he knew that i would come to toronto with rubenstein or horowitz or serkin and he would never go to anyone 's concert .
but he knew that i was coming and he would pick me up at the airport and make sure we spent the evening together , listening to recordings and talking . you know so many of the top pianists from the 20th century - both musically and personally .
do you see any patterns ?
what makes them great ? in german we call it " ausstrahlung " - a presence , a communication from the stage to the people , which many people do not have .
if you have this , it does n't even matter if you play a lot of wrong notes .
of course , rubenstein , horowitz and serkin had this . franz mohr lives in new york and , though nearing 80 , he still travels regularly as a piano technician , teacher and lecturer .
he currently tours with italian pianist mauricio pollini .

in his 30-year career as a piano technician for piano greats like vladimir horowitz , arthur rubenstein and glenn gould , mohr became more than just a highly valued tuner : he was also a friend and confident to the pianists he worked with . this was part of the success he had as steinway 's chief piano technician - a job that meant tempering not only grand pianos , but also dealing with the often unpredictable temperaments of the world famous artists who performed on them . 79-year-old mohr is a native of düren , germany , where he and his parents miraculously survived severe allied bombings in 1944 .
after training to be a piano technician in germany , he immigrated to new york in 1962 to accept a job with steinway & sons .
three years later , he became the piano maker 's chief piano technician , a role he took over from legendary tuner bill hupfer . dw-world.de : mr. mohr , how did your relationship to music begin ? franz mohr : i grew up with music .
i went to the hochschule für musik in cologne where i studied the violin .
then i developed tremendous physical problems with my left wrist .
it was terrible .
i had to take breaks and visited all kinds of doctors and finally had to come to the very painful decision that i could n't become a performing artist but had to do something else with my life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a classic i saw an ad in a german music magazine that rudolf ibach sohn - the oldest piano manufacturing company in germany , founded in 1774 - was looking for apprentices .
i was already 24 years old at that time , but i thought , this also has something to do with music - why do n't i try it ?
they accepted me and i just loved working with my hands and learning about all the phases of piano building . the ultimate dream in the music world - at least as a piano technician - is steinway .
around 1954 , i applied for a job as a concert piano tuner for a concert management company in duesseldorf , which was also a steinway dealer .
and i got the job !
for the first time , i started to work on steinways and i really fell in love with them , both as a technician and as a musician . what is special about steinway pianos ? not only the design of a the piano , but also the quality of wood which goes into the piano are very important - especially when it comes to the sound board .

the crazy ruler , as many called him , commissioned the construction of castle after castle - whose grandiosity and splendor eventually led to his ruin . the most famous among king ludwig 's castle collection is neuschwanstein , located in southern bavaria .
this sightseeing must is high on the list of nearly every tourist to germany , which is why efforts have been made in the past few years to ease the flow of visitors with a new " traffic control " system . longs waits were the biggest complaint among castle guests , but administrator klaus peter scheck explained that things have changed : " when the visitor buys a ticket he receives an entry time and a tour time printed on the ticket , along with a tour number . " once a quiet retreat , now viewed by millions though waits have been shortened , visitors still have to take into account the 30 minute drive there , as the castle is perched on the top of a cliff 1,000 meters -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- high .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle attracts around 1.3 million tourists per year those who venture there will be well rewarded .
king ludwig 's aim was to build an " ideal castle , " based on old knights ' castles - a goal most would say he achieved . though it was meant as a place of quiet retreat for the mad king and not for the public , the neuschwanstein castle was opened to visitors shortly after his death in 1886 .
since that time , some 1.3 million people come each year to be dazzled by the gold and glitter , velvet and silk , kitsch and art that the castle has to offer . a room for richard wagner " there are around 90 rooms , 16 of which are fully restored , " described klaus peter scheck , " the most important room in the castle is the " sängersaal " -lrb- singers ' hall -rrb- .
art historians say it 's the reason why the castle was built in the first place . " the singers ' hall , ornamented with golden chandeliers , was dedicated to the composer richard wagner .
scenes from wagner 's operas , which are based on german mythology , adorn walls throughout the castle . king ludwig was not known for having a grip on reality , espcially the reality of his finances . the neuschwanstein castle overextended his financial resources .
in 1886 , the 40-year-old king was declared unfit and ejected from the throne .
shortly thereafter , he took his own life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion has changed a bit since king ludwig 's era a hi-tech castle from the beginning but the mad king 's fairy tale castle lives on - for as many as 6,000 visitors a day , in peak season . in addition to the tour appointment system , a new museum shop has been added to the site .
not only the usual knickknacks but also more intellectual items can be found there , like the bavarian castle administration 's publication . a solution to waiting in long lines at the museum shop has also been implemented : tech savvy visitors can order online at neuschwanstein 's own internet book shop . it 's only fitting that the castle should carry on ludwig 's hi-tech approach .
in those days , all the rooms were warmed via a hot-air central heating system and each floor had running water - modern luxuries back then . keeping up with the upkeep however , being built with up-to-date accouterments has n't kept the castle from aging over the years . " the biggest problem is the visitors themselves " because they bring moisture with them , admitted scheck .
" all the textiles and murals suffer from the moisture . " on the other hand , the fact that the castle has n't been heated in 130 years has minimized the damage , added the castle director .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be one of the next seven wonders of the world in addition to the visitors , mother nature also makes regular upkeep around the castle a necessity .
the cliffs that the castle rests on have to be continually reinforced because weather wears the limestone away . both regular maintenance and the latest major improvements have n't been cheap .
the state of bavaria has spent 11 million euros -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in the last 15 years on renovations and the new " traffic control " system for visitors .
that may sound like a lot , but neuschwanstein is also a good source of income . the next world wonder ? what 's more , the investment may be rewarded with something priceless : a coveted " seven wonders of the world " title . a former unesco staff member came up with idea to revise the long-standing list of wonders and a committee of experts selected 21 cultural sites throughout the world , including neuschwanstein .
until july 2007 , anyone can place their vote for the bavarian castle by visiting www.neuschwanstein.de. neuschwanstein as one of the next wonders of the world ?

" we can not allow extremist forces to define the agenda of the middle east , " steinmeier said .
" we must strive to stop extremist forces from wanting to broaden the scope of the conflict , " he said . " we are making all efforts to create the suitable conditions which will allow for a ceasefire , within a political framework aimed at reaching permanent stability in the region , " steinmeier said . israel launched its massive offensive on lebanon after the lebanese shiite group hezbollah captured two israeli soldiers in a border region on july 12 with the aim of securing a prisoner exchange . in 11 days , the conflict has killed more than 340 people in lebanon , more than 30 in israel , and forced upwards of half a million lebanese to flee their homes . complex ceasefire conditions but for his part abul gheit insisted that a prisoner swap should be part of these conditions and stressed the need for a ceasefire .
" a ceasefire is a principal and essential demand which we must concentrate on , " he said .
" reaching stability for a ceasefire must go hand in hand with certain procedures , including the swap . " israel has around 10,000 palestinian prisoners and an unknown number of lebanese in its jails .

the crazy ruler , as many called him , commissioned the construction of castle after castle - whose grandiosity and splendor eventually led to his ruin . the most famous among king ludwig 's castle collection is neuschwanstein , located in southern bavaria .
this sightseeing must is high on the list of nearly every tourist to germany , which is why efforts have been made in the past few years to ease the flow of visitors with a new " traffic control " system . longs waits were the biggest complaint among castle guests , but administrator klaus peter scheck explained that things have changed : " when the visitor buys a ticket he receives an entry time and a tour time printed on the ticket , along with a tour number . " once a quiet retreat , now viewed by millions though waits have been shortened , visitors still have to take into account the 30 minute drive there , as the castle is perched on the top of a cliff 1,000 meters -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- high .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle attracts around 1.3 million tourists per year those who venture there will be well rewarded .
king ludwig 's aim was to build an " ideal castle , " based on old knights ' castles - a goal most would say he achieved . though it was meant as a place of quiet retreat for the mad king and not for the public , the neuschwanstein castle was opened to visitors shortly after his death in 1886 .
since that time , some 1.3 million people come each year to be dazzled by the gold and glitter , velvet and silk , kitsch and art that the castle has to offer . a room for richard wagner " there are around 90 rooms , 16 of which are fully restored , " described klaus peter scheck , " the most important room in the castle is the " sängersaal " -lrb- singers ' hall -rrb- .
art historians say it 's the reason why the castle was built in the first place . " the singers ' hall , ornamented with golden chandeliers , was dedicated to the composer richard wagner .
scenes from wagner 's operas , which are based on german mythology , adorn walls throughout the castle . king ludwig was not known for having a grip on reality , espcially the reality of his finances . the neuschwanstein castle overextended his financial resources .
in 1886 , the 40-year-old king was declared unfit and ejected from the throne .
shortly thereafter , he took his own life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion has changed a bit since king ludwig 's era a hi-tech castle from the beginning but the mad king 's fairy tale castle lives on - for as many as 6,000 visitors a day , in peak season . in addition to the tour appointment system , a new museum shop has been added to the site .
not only the usual knickknacks but also more intellectual items can be found there , like the bavarian castle administration 's publication . a solution to waiting in long lines at the museum shop has also been implemented : tech savvy visitors can order online at neuschwanstein 's own internet book shop . it 's only fitting that the castle should carry on ludwig 's hi-tech approach .
in those days , all the rooms were warmed via a hot-air central heating system and each floor had running water - modern luxuries back then . keeping up with the upkeep however , being built with up-to-date accouterments has n't kept the castle from aging over the years . " the biggest problem is the visitors themselves " because they bring moisture with them , admitted scheck .
" all the textiles and murals suffer from the moisture . " on the other hand , the fact that the castle has n't been heated in 130 years has minimized the damage , added the castle director .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be one of the next seven wonders of the world in addition to the visitors , mother nature also makes regular upkeep around the castle a necessity .
the cliffs that the castle rests on have to be continually reinforced because weather wears the limestone away . both regular maintenance and the latest major improvements have n't been cheap .
the state of bavaria has spent 11 million euros -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in the last 15 years on renovations and the new " traffic control " system for visitors .
that may sound like a lot , but neuschwanstein is also a good source of income . the next world wonder ? what 's more , the investment may be rewarded with something priceless : a coveted " seven wonders of the world " title . a former unesco staff member came up with idea to revise the long-standing list of wonders and a committee of experts selected 21 cultural sites throughout the world , including neuschwanstein .
until july 2007 , anyone can place their vote for the bavarian castle by visiting www.neuschwanstein.de. neuschwanstein as one of the next wonders of the world ?

the crazy ruler , as many called him , commissioned the construction of castle after castle - whose grandiosity and splendor eventually led to his ruin . the most famous among king ludwig 's castle collection is neuschwanstein , located in southern bavaria .
this sightseeing must is high on the list of nearly every tourist to germany , which is why efforts have been made in the past few years to ease the flow of visitors with a new " traffic control " system . longs waits were the biggest complaint among castle guests , but administrator klaus peter scheck explained that things have changed : " when the visitor buys a ticket he receives an entry time and a tour time printed on the ticket , along with a tour number . " once a quiet retreat , now viewed by millions though waits have been shortened , visitors still have to take into account the 30 minute drive there , as the castle is perched on the top of a cliff 1,000 meters -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- high .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle attracts around 1.3 million tourists per year those who venture there will be well rewarded .
king ludwig 's aim was to build an " ideal castle , " based on old knights ' castles - a goal most would say he achieved . though it was meant as a place of quiet retreat for the mad king and not for the public , the neuschwanstein castle was opened to visitors shortly after his death in 1886 .
since that time , some 1.3 million people come each year to be dazzled by the gold and glitter , velvet and silk , kitsch and art that the castle has to offer . a room for richard wagner " there are around 90 rooms , 16 of which are fully restored , " described klaus peter scheck , " the most important room in the castle is the " sängersaal " -lrb- singers ' hall -rrb- .
art historians say it 's the reason why the castle was built in the first place . " the singers ' hall , ornamented with golden chandeliers , was dedicated to the composer richard wagner .
scenes from wagner 's operas , which are based on german mythology , adorn walls throughout the castle . king ludwig was not known for having a grip on reality , espcially the reality of his finances . the neuschwanstein castle overextended his financial resources .
in 1886 , the 40-year-old king was declared unfit and ejected from the throne .
shortly thereafter , he took his own life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion has changed a bit since king ludwig 's era a hi-tech castle from the beginning but the mad king 's fairy tale castle lives on - for as many as 6,000 visitors a day , in peak season . in addition to the tour appointment system , a new museum shop has been added to the site .
not only the usual knickknacks but also more intellectual items can be found there , like the bavarian castle administration 's publication . a solution to waiting in long lines at the museum shop has also been implemented : tech savvy visitors can order online at neuschwanstein 's own internet book shop . it 's only fitting that the castle should carry on ludwig 's hi-tech approach .
in those days , all the rooms were warmed via a hot-air central heating system and each floor had running water - modern luxuries back then . keeping up with the upkeep however , being built with up-to-date accouterments has n't kept the castle from aging over the years . " the biggest problem is the visitors themselves " because they bring moisture with them , admitted scheck .
" all the textiles and murals suffer from the moisture . " on the other hand , the fact that the castle has n't been heated in 130 years has minimized the damage , added the castle director .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be one of the next seven wonders of the world in addition to the visitors , mother nature also makes regular upkeep around the castle a necessity .
the cliffs that the castle rests on have to be continually reinforced because weather wears the limestone away . both regular maintenance and the latest major improvements have n't been cheap .
the state of bavaria has spent 11 million euros -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in the last 15 years on renovations and the new " traffic control " system for visitors .
that may sound like a lot , but neuschwanstein is also a good source of income . the next world wonder ? what 's more , the investment may be rewarded with something priceless : a coveted " seven wonders of the world " title . a former unesco staff member came up with idea to revise the long-standing list of wonders and a committee of experts selected 21 cultural sites throughout the world , including neuschwanstein .
until july 2007 , anyone can place their vote for the bavarian castle by visiting www.neuschwanstein.de. neuschwanstein as one of the next wonders of the world ?

gerry sutcliffe , visiting new jersey , said any plans to introduce a similar law in the uk would have to take into account its different " structures " .
he has met the parents of megan kanka , the seven-year-old whose murder in the us by a neighbour who was a convicted sex offender inspired megan 's law .
it gives us parents access to details on paedophiles living in their area .
critics say by moving towards a uk form of megan 's law , the government would be pandering to media pressure but supporters say it would save children 's lives .
campaigners have long called for a similar law in the uk - sometimes called sarah 's law after eight-year-old sarah payne , who was murdered six years ago by paedophile roy whiting . "
they said ... that the uk will be affected differently from the us , because of the different structures that exist " gerry sutcliffe after his meeting on saturday at the kankas ' hamilton home , mr sutcliffe said the couple did not want " sensationalism around these issues " .
he added : " they said , quite rightly , that the uk will be affected differently from the us , because of the different structures that exist .
" you ca n't simply transpose things across .
you have got to look at the context . "
he said any changes in the british approach would have to combine three elements .
these were a reinforced multi-agency approach , treatment for offenders where possible and " controlled information within communities so people know what is going on in their communities " .
" that would add to public confidence , " he said .
" we certainly do n't want to go back to the situation we had with marches in portsmouth and vigilantes attacking paediatricians . "
he said he was not only looking at the us but would also examine practices from other countries before presenting his proposals to home secretary john reid in the autumn .
public outcry mr sutcliffe began his us visit earlier this week , talking to lawmakers and experts about how to deal with child sex offenders and how much information the public is entitled to know .
the idea of megan 's law was ruled out by the government when jack straw was home secretary , but mr sutcliffe said the visit was not a case of making policy " in response to the tabloids " , but was about being " practical " .
the huge public outcry that followed megan 's murder by a neighbour 12 years ago in hamilton spawned a raft of local legislation , which was later adopted in various forms across 50 states .
the law allows public access to some information on the history and whereabouts of some high-risk sex offenders , which supporters say has been a valuable deterrent and an important tool for curbing their activities .
in the uk , the news of the world has run a lengthy campaign to introduce sarah 's law .
but there have been concerns raised that releasing paedophiles ' information could divert attention from other dangerous people , as some children are more at risk from people they know than from strangers .
the office of the children 's commissioner has said introducing a similar law could harm children as it would drive offenders " underground " .

gerry sutcliffe , visiting new jersey , said any plans to introduce a similar law in the uk would have to take into account its different " structures " .
he has met the parents of megan kanka , the seven-year-old whose murder in the us by a neighbour who was a convicted sex offender inspired megan 's law .
it gives us parents access to details on paedophiles living in their area .
critics say by moving towards a uk form of megan 's law , the government would be pandering to media pressure but supporters say it would save children 's lives .
campaigners have long called for a similar law in the uk - sometimes called sarah 's law after eight-year-old sarah payne , who was murdered six years ago by paedophile roy whiting .
they said ... that the uk will be affected differently from the us , because of the different structures that exist gerry sutcliffe after his meeting on saturday at the kankas ' hamilton home , mr sutcliffe said the couple did not want " sensationalism around these issues " .
he added : " they said , quite rightly , that the uk will be affected differently from the us , because of the different structures that exist .
" you ca n't simply transpose things across .
you have got to look at the context . "
he said any changes in the british approach would have to combine three elements .
these were a reinforced multi-agency approach , treatment for offenders where possible and " controlled information within communities so people know what is going on in their communities " .
" that would add to public confidence , " he said .
" we certainly do n't want to go back to the situation we had with marches in portsmouth and vigilantes attacking paediatricians . "
he said he was not only looking at the us but would also examine practices from other countries before presenting his proposals to home secretary john reid in the autumn .
public outcry mr sutcliffe began his us visit earlier this week , talking to lawmakers and experts about how to deal with child sex offenders and how much information the public is entitled to know .
the idea of megan 's law was ruled out by the government when jack straw was home secretary , but mr sutcliffe said the visit was not a case of making policy " in response to the tabloids " , but was about being " practical " .
the news of the world campaigned for sarah 's law the huge public outcry that followed megan 's murder by a neighbour 12 years ago in hamilton spawned a raft of local legislation , which was later adopted in various forms across 50 states .
the law allows public access to some information on the history and whereabouts of some high-risk sex offenders , which supporters say has been a valuable deterrent and an important tool for curbing their activities .
in the uk , the news of the world has run a lengthy campaign to introduce sarah 's law .
but there have been concerns raised that releasing paedophiles ' information could divert attention from other dangerous people , as some children are more at risk from people they know than from strangers .
the office of the children 's commissioner has said introducing a similar law could harm children as it would drive offenders " underground " .

as the tide began to rise , the four went into the water next to a sign warning people not to attempt the crossing .
last month an inquest into an outdoor pursuits leader who drowned there heard that new signs had been put up .
five others who were trapped had used a new bell to alert emergency services .
the rescue was launched just after 1400 bst on saturday by swansea coastguard off worms head , a tidal island reached by a causeway which is passable for only two hours either side of low tide .
a mobile phone call had alerted them to the fact that as well as those people trying to the swim , there were other people still on the island and cut off by the rising tide .
do n't play chicken with the sea , it will always win eric birkett , swansea coastguard when the coastguard rescue teams arrived , they found the four trying to swim the causeway were in difficulty - although they did finally make it .
the other five people cut off on the island were transferred back to safety by the inshore lifeboat .
eric birkett , watch manager at swansea coastguard , said : " bizarrely , the four that went into the water entered the rising tide nearby to very large signs which warn the public not to attempt the crossing .
" this has been the site of a recent fatality , and there is also a large bell in situ which can be rung if people are seen to be in difficulty in the causeway .
" we believe this was the first time it has been used to gain attention .
" we are therefore reminding the public to take care at the crossing point and also to remind them that the island can be reached only at low tide and only for about two hours .
" do n't play chicken with the sea , it will always win , " added mr birkett .
the extra warning signs and the bell for those stranded to summon help have been erected following the death of ian reynolds , 29 , of pontarddulais in may 2005 .
mr reynolds had been camping on the island and when he woke to find the tide rising he attempted to swim to shore , but never made it .

the party plans to ask londoners to choose their official candidate this autumn for 2008 's mayoral election .
" would i fall on my sword for young dave ?
yeah , actually i probably would , " said mr norris .
" i do want the party to succeed and i am a huge supporter of david cameron , " he told gmtv 's sunday programme .
" i happen to think the drive to present a different kind of image of the party is absolutely what we need to do .
" and to people who say ' but this is about positioning , it 's not about policy ' , i say you 've got to be in the position first and that 's exactly what he 's achieving . "
he came second in 2004 and 2000 mr norris stressed that he had yet to make up his mind .

dai davies , president of the national farmers ' union -lrb- nfu -rrb- cymru , said : " at a time when milk prices are plummeting , costs are shooting up " .
with wales ' main agricultural event opening at llanelwedd in powys on monday , he said " despair at low milk prices " was felt throughout the uk .
other nfu concerns include tb in cattle and red tape over sheep tagging .
the nfu said contractors providing silage for feed were concerned that because of the recent hike in diesel prices , dairy farmers would have difficulty in meeting their charges .
mr davies said the dairy industry needed " profitability and long-term stability " .
he added : " talk of downsizing the industry will not resolve the problem and there is a real danger that we will lose critical mass . "
a survey last year by nfu cymru found that dairy farmers received 10p out of 35p per pint of milk .
the number of dairy farmers in wales has fallen in 10 years from 5,363 to 3,658 in 2004 , according to welsh assembly government figures .
the farmers ' union of wales has also warned in recent months that dairy farmers could become an " endangered species " due to low prices and the " overwhelming power " of supermarkets .

one in three fans at the event has travelled from the uk , attracted by cheap air fares , sun , beaches - and music .
situated between barcelona and valencia , the festival - now in its 12th year - takes over the resort town of benicassim for a long weekend .
organisers say 10,000-12,000 britons are here , with many choosing to use it as the focal point of their summer holiday .
" there 's no glastonbury and there 's no other real comparison in the uk , so we thought we 'd go somewhere abroad , " says tom corbett , 29 , from london .
" we had a couple of days in barcelona first and i expect a few people will mix it in with a holiday as well . "
sandy henderson , 32 , from london , came to the festival in 2005 after finding out about it from a friend who went several years ago .
" that year , they mentioned that it was extremely spanish , with few english speakers , " he says . "
it 's so easy to get tickets without sitting on the internet all day " ian edmondson -lrb- left -rrb- did you go to benicassim ?
" so it seems like it 's changed significantly .
it 's like glastonbury but with sun and a beach . "
budget air travel has made it easy for brits to reach continental festivals for little more than it may cost to reach an event in the uk .
" it 's cheaper to come here than to go from manchester to reading , " british festival supremo vince power says .
" we have to thank the cheap airlines .
but also people think it 's guaranteed weather here .
they can make a holiday out of it . "
the number of uk visitors to benicassim has risen every year , according to mr power .
he took a stake in the spanish festival after selling live music company mean fiddler , which organises reading and leeds .
" there 's no glastonbury this year , which helps , " he says .
" and the bill is really good this year . "
sleeping bags it is not just fans who are making the journey - saturday 's line-up was headed by uk stars morrissey , franz ferdinand and the kooks .
" it 's less likely to rain in benicassim than it is at t in the park , " says franz ferdinand singer alex kapranos .
the weather is a big attraction for fans and bands alike , with little chance of a glastonbury-style wash-out on the costa azahar .
and unlike british festivals , the music does not get into full swing until the late evening , going on until 0800 the following morning .
" people at british festivals tend to have their sleeping bags tucked over their faces by 11 o 'clock , " kapranos says .
the later start is intended to stop visitors getting overheated and lets them spend most of the day at the beach - which is about a 30 minute walk from the festival and its campsites .
but it can also have its drawbacks for brits who may be more used to swimming in glastonbury mud .
" i 've got massive sunburn from being outside in the day , " says jonathan withey , 29 , from brighton .
" if you are comfortable in the sun , you will love it .
if you are not , you will struggle . "
despite its popularity , tickets for benicassim were relatively easy to come by - unlike many uk events , which sell out within hours .
" it 's so easy to get tickets without sitting on the internet all day , " says 35-year-old ian edmondson from lancaster .
" i just went on the website and got them within five minutes . "
and british organisers could follow other continental examples , according to colin dear , 25 , from essex , who was at the festival sporting an england cricket shirt .
showers are provided on the campsites and the lavatories in the festival arena are " proper toilets " , he says .
" they do n't smell because they flush .
well , they do n't smell much . "
but there have been complaints from the uk contingent about the size of the main arena and the distance to the campsites .
glastonbury 's return next year will prove whether this year 's influx to benicassim is a one-off - or whether its popularity among uk fans will continue to grow .
the choice between benicassim and glastonbury will be " easy " next year , according to tom corbett - michael eavis ' farm is still the first choice .
" but if i ca n't get a ticket , then i may be back . "

one in three fans at the event has travelled from the uk , attracted by cheap air fares , sun , beaches - and music .
situated between barcelona and valencia , the festival - now in its 12th year - takes over the resort town of benicassim for a long weekend .
organisers say 10,000-12,000 britons are here , with many choosing to use it as the focal point of their summer holiday .
" there 's no glastonbury and there 's no other real comparison in the uk , so we thought we 'd go somewhere abroad , " says tom corbett , 29 , from london .
" we had a couple of days in barcelona first and i expect a few people will mix it in with a holiday as well . "
sandy henderson , 32 , from london , came to the festival in 2005 after finding out about it from a friend who went several years ago .
" that year , they mentioned that it was extremely spanish , with few english speakers , " he says .
it 's so easy to get tickets without sitting on the internet all day ian edmondson -lrb- left -rrb- did you go to benicassim ?
" so it seems like it 's changed significantly .
it 's like glastonbury but with sun and a beach . "
budget air travel has made it easy for brits to reach continental festivals for little more than it may cost to reach an event in the uk .
" it 's cheaper to come here than to go from manchester to reading , " british festival supremo vince power says .
" we have to thank the cheap airlines .
but also people think it 's guaranteed weather here .
they can make a holiday out of it . "
the number of uk visitors to benicassim has risen every year , according to mr power .
he took a stake in the spanish festival after selling live music company mean fiddler , which organises reading and leeds .
" there 's no glastonbury this year , which helps , " he says .
" and the bill is really good this year . "
sleeping bags it is not just fans who are making the journey - saturday 's line-up was headed by uk stars morrissey , franz ferdinand and the kooks .
" it 's less likely to rain in benicassim than it is at t in the park , " says franz ferdinand singer alex kapranos .
the weather is a big attraction for fans and bands alike , with little chance of a glastonbury-style wash-out on the costa azahar .
and unlike british festivals , the music does not get into full swing until the late evening , going on until 0800 the following morning .
franz ferdinand were one of the british acts on show on saturday " people at british festivals tend to have their sleeping bags tucked over their faces by 11 o 'clock , " kapranos says .
the later start is intended to stop visitors getting overheated and lets them spend most of the day at the beach - which is about a 30 minute walk from the festival and its campsites .
but it can also have its drawbacks for brits who may be more used to swimming in glastonbury mud .
" i 've got massive sunburn from being outside in the day , " says jonathan withey , 29 , from brighton .
" if you are comfortable in the sun , you will love it .
if you are not , you will struggle . "
despite its popularity , tickets for benicassim were relatively easy to come by - unlike many uk events , which sell out within hours .
" it 's so easy to get tickets without sitting on the internet all day , " says 35-year-old ian edmondson from lancaster .
" i just went on the website and got them within five minutes . "
the town of benicassim tried to make brits feel at home and british organisers could follow other continental examples , according to colin dear , 25 , from essex , who was at the festival sporting an england cricket shirt .
showers are provided on the campsites and the lavatories in the festival arena are " proper toilets " , he says .
" they do n't smell because they flush .
well , they do n't smell much . "
but there have been complaints from the uk contingent about the size of the main arena and the distance to the campsites .
glastonbury 's return next year will prove whether this year 's influx to benicassim is a one-off - or whether its popularity among uk fans will continue to grow .
the choice between benicassim and glastonbury will be " easy " next year , according to tom corbett - michael eavis ' farm is still the first choice .

"
i think it will be a smooth transition ... there will be a timetable decided by tony and the party " john prescott prescott defiant and , in the wake of the deputy prime minister 's comments on sunday , attention has once again focused on this autumn 's labour conference in manchester as the likely forum for the issue to be resolved once and for all .
mr prescott added to the speculation by suggesting leadership elections would come " very shortly " .
and he revealed , for the first time , that a timetable for the prime minister 's departure would be set out to ensure the " orderly transition " of power .
only last week the prime minister suggested he would still be in office in a year 's time , and loyalists in westminster have been insisting he will still be prime minister at the time of the 2007 party conference .
similarly , mr blair and party bosses have slapped down any suggestion he should map out a timetable for his departure and the transition of power to his successor , still seen as gordon brown .
stay or go but mr prescott has now thrown all that into doubt during his first television interview since he was engulfed by a series of crises .
giving a robust and defiant defence of his own position , mr prescott dismissed any suggestion he had acted improperly in his dealings with us dome owner philip anshutz .
he accepted last week 's report from standards watchdogs that he should have registered his stay at mr anshutz 's ranch , but claimed he had done so 11 months late because " there was a change of the definition of hospitality " .
that remark alone will raise a few eyebrows by opposition mps who do not believe the rules changed , but that mr prescott registered the visit belatedly to soften any criticism of his behaviour .
but the comments which will draw the greatest scrutiny , particularly in labour circles , were those concerning the prime minister 's future .
when mr prescott was asked if he should resign his own job , he said he still had a role to play in the party and added : " the party has its means by which it can be making decisions about that .
and i think that will come very shortly . "
that can only relate to the party 's annual opportunity to elect new leaders and deputies , if it so chooses , at the party conference .
and with mr prescott 's future so closely linked to mr blair 's - both have suggested they stay or go together - that raised immediate speculation that he was talking about elections for the top two jobs , possibly even as soon as this year 's conference .
sitting duck mr prescott said he wanted and expected to see a leadership election to give " sufficient time " for mr blair 's successor to settle into the job before the next election .
and he added : " therefore there will be a timetable which will be decided by tony and the party " .
that comment added to speculation that the prime minister does now envisage setting out a specific time for the handover to his successor with a date for his own resignation .
such a move has previously been rejected by party bosses on the grounds the moment any timetable was announced , the prime minister would immediately become a lame duck facing opposition demands for him to go straight away .
precisely how such a timetable would work is unclear , but there has been some chatter in westminster that the prime minister could call a special one-off leadership election conference some time next spring with a short period afterwards before the successor officially takes over the reins .
alternatively there are those who still believe the election should come at this year 's manchester conference .
what is certainly the case is that mr prescott has thrown a new factor into the equation and this speculation - along with continuing questions over his own future - may well run right through a long hot summer .
