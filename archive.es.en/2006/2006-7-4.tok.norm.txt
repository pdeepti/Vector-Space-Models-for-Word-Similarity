over 90 percent of visitors said it really is " a time to make friends . " millions of fans descended on germany during the opening stages of the world cup , and while some have already followed their teams home and others look for last-minute bargains on airfare to berlin , a study published monday showed nearly all of them enjoyed their time in the country . " germany has created an excellent atmosphere and image of itself , " said alfons madeja , a sports scientist , while presenting the study .
" the world cup has also contributed to a new , natural and healthy german sense of self-confidence . " just over 93 percent of the 5,000 soccer fans from around the world who took part in the study gave the host country an overall grade of good to very good , madeja told the german dpa news agency . eating , drinking and partying win out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are one of you in the wrong section ?
friendship and the bare necessities proved to be what most fans were looking to get out of their trip to germany .
at 88.7 percent , meeting people from other countries was nearly as important as the triumvirate of " eating , drinking and partying , " according to the study . the venues ' elaborate cultural programs , on the other hand , did n't fare as well .
music concerts were the most popular part of the non-soccer program , catching the interest of 43.1 percent of foreign visitors . " art and culture are , however , an important factor in repeat visits , " according to a study of the 2004 european championships . only 4 percent of the respondents came to germany alone while 64 percent came in with friends . " there were a lot of men coming in clubs who had previously traveled to several world and european cups in the past , " madeja said , adding that the rest of the visitors came with family members . changing the image of germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are n't used to taking shelter under the flag the stereotypical view of germans as orderly and reserved also changed in a number of minds , according to madeja . " we showed emotion and finally were not afraid to be happy , express our pride and joy and show our national colors , " he added . but germans still held on to their image as organized and efficient while presenting the country as a safe place to visit with a short supply of good cooks . safety , ease of transportation and organization all ranked well in the survey , while the quality of food left about one of four people looking for something else to eat . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer 's gain is the entertainment and travel industry 's loss the world cup has made homebodies of film buffs and theatergoers , who stay glued to the tube instead of going out .
result : a temporary dip in the german entertainment sector .
-lrb- june 29 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : germany finally gets an image makeover the full significance of germany holding the world cup has just started to register .
in its typically understated manner , the country is winning over its critics - just by being itself .

long known for its rigid shopping laws that force stores to close at certain times and on sundays , germany is rethinking consumerism and may abolish the rules . it 's a long tradition in germany : get up early and run to the store on saturday morning to shop for the week , because you might as well forget about picking up anything on sunday . but over the past few years , shops in large german cities have begun staying open longer on weekdays and saturdays to meet consumer demand .
some crafty stores have even skirted the sunday shopping ban by claiming tourists as shoppers as these shops are allowed an exemption . but now , germany 's parliament , busy with federal reform , has decided to repeal a 1956 " store closing law " and make it easier for consumers to spend their money when they please . " germany has a too complicated and protracted decision-making process , " chancellor angela merkel told parliament last week . regional decisions the repeal of the ladenschlussgesetz -lrb- store closing law -rrb- is part of a series of 25 measures to reform the federal system to give the 16 states more power in matters of health , education , wages and prisons .
in exchange for the devolution , the federal government 's power is enhanced by cutting in half the number of laws that must be approved by state legislatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some stores such as ones in train stations are already allowed to stay open on sundays as a result , the states will be able to set their own shopping hours .
currently , stores are required to close by 8 p.m. and stay closed on sundays .
that is later than allowed until 1996 , when shops were required to close by 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and 1 p.m. on saturdays . trade unions have protested the proposed changes the law , saying it helps provide families time together and protects small businesses , which could be pushed out of the market by larger corporations that force their employees to work longer hours . despite the pushing for the reform , government officials said they hope the states do n't change current hours . " it would be good if the states do not approve more than four sundays a year that stores can stay open , " said merkel . changes ahead the reform package will be voted on july 7 by germany 's upper house of parliament .
if approved as expected , the measures will take effect in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup has led some shops to stay open on sundays but no one is coming in berlin , as well as a number of other states , officials said they plan to keep the sunday shopping ban on all but a few sundays each year but will leave other times up to store owners . still , even now in most large german cities such as berlin , munich and hamburg , it is possible to buy goods on sundays at gas stations , train station shops or in certain stores in tourist zones .
the immigrant communities , such as the turks , also often do business on sunday . meanwhile , during the world cup , many stores , such as swedish furniture giant ikea , have taken advantage of a temporary suspension of the shopping rules and have extended their store hours to remain open on sundays . however , a quick look at these stores is telling , as only a few customers can be seen strolling through the aisles as most people are out enjoying the unusually beautiful weather or watching matches dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shops to stay open longer for world cup while german soccer fans hope the home team will rack up the goals , businesses are counting on longer opening hours to fill their cash registers with euros , but not everyone is convinced it will work .

long known for its rigid shopping laws that force stores to close at certain times and on sundays , germany is rethinking consumerism and may abolish the rules . it 's a long tradition in germany : get up early and run to the store on saturday morning to shop for the week , because you might as well forget about picking up anything on sunday . but over the past few years , shops in large german cities have begun staying open longer on weekdays and saturdays to meet consumer demand .
some crafty stores have even skirted the sunday shopping ban by claiming tourists as shoppers as these shops are allowed an exemption . but now , germany 's parliament , busy with federal reform , has decided to repeal a 1956 " store closing law " and make it easier for consumers to spend their money when they please . " germany has a too complicated and protracted decision-making process , " chancellor angela merkel told parliament last week . regional decisions the repeal of the ladenschlussgesetz -lrb- store closing law -rrb- is part of a series of 25 measures to reform the federal system to give the 16 states more power in matters of health , education , wages and prisons .

" it would be good if the states do not approve more than four sundays a year that stores can stay open , " said merkel . changes ahead the reform package will be voted on july 7 by germany 's upper house of parliament .
if approved as expected , the measures will take effect in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup has led some shops to stay open on sundays but no one is coming in berlin , as well as a number of other states , officials said they plan to keep the sunday shopping ban on all but a few sundays each year but will leave other times up to store owners . still , even now in most large german cities such as berlin , munich and hamburg , it is possible to buy goods on sundays at gas stations , train station shops or in certain stores in tourist zones .

german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- has come under fire over a new health reform deal proposed on monday . according to the deal which was hammered out after late-night talks sunday , healthcare contributions paid by employees and their employers will increase from the beginning of next year by around half a percentage point to help close a massive funding gap . in addition , around 1.5 billion in tax revenue will go toward health insurance for children in 2008 and double that amount in 2009 .

german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- has come under fire over a new health reform deal proposed on monday . according to the deal which was hammered out after late-night talks sunday , healthcare contributions paid by employees and their employers will increase from the beginning of next year by around half a percentage point to help close a massive funding gap . in addition , around 1.5 billion in tax revenue will go toward health insurance for children in 2008 and double that amount in 2009 . " this is an important breakthrough we have succeeded in making , " merkel said monday after the late-night huddle . however , a day later finance minister peer steinbrück said the financing plans for children 's healthcare were not yet fixed .
in tuesday 's edition of the handelsblatt daily , steinbrück said " we have not yet agreed to the finance format . " merkel 's health reform thwarts the plan by the spd coalition partners , who had sought an increase in tax to meet the funding shortfall .
merkel rejected the tax hike partly because the electorate already faces a rise in sales tax next year . spd critical of health reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat leader , kurt beck on tuesday , the leader of the spd , kurt beck , told the daily mainzer allgemeinen zeitung he had hoped to be able to lower contributions but that " one has to make compromises in a coalition . "
in the end , " patients would be the winners " of the deal , he said . the reforms drew the ire of guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , the biggest opposition group .
westerwelle said the proposals reminded him of a planned economy and had " nothing to do with free competition . "
westerwelle accused the coalition government of using the distraction around the football world cup to " cash up . " industry says health reforms stifle employment big business has argued that the reforms will make it even more expensive to hire new employees .
statutory healthcare costs are currently 14 percent of an employee 's wage , split between worker and employer . the president of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , ludwig georg braun told the daily neuen osnabrücker zeitung on tuesday that the increase in non-wage labor costs means that firms wo n't be able afford to expand their workforce .
he called for set health care contributions independent of wages . the head of the panel of six economic advisors to the government , bert rürup , called the reform a " rather modest compromise based on the lowest common denominator . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics says germany 's health care system is too bureaucratic germany 's 123-year-old public health system is widely criticized for its bloated bureaucracy and lack of transparency . according the organization for economic co-operation and development , germany spends close to 11 percent of its gross domestic product on healthcare , more than france , austria , the netherlands , italy , britain and spain . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government agrees on health , corporate tax reform germany 's ruling coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- said after all-night talks that it had agreed on parts of key reforms to healthcare and corporate taxation .
-lrb- july 3 , 2006 -rrb- german health system not quite in intensive care going by media reports and public opinion in germany , one might think the country 's health care system is sclerotic and near collapse .
but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- vat increase puts germany closer to eu average the 3 percent value-added tax increase that was part of chancellor angela merkel 's election campaign did n't come as a surprise to anyone in germany , but that does n't mean everyone is willing to accept it .

it was n't until a 3-0 win against ukraine and a spot in the semi-finals that honking , flag-waving cars hit the italian streets . while celebrations are normal occurrences at any point in an international tournament in other countries , a serious match-fixing scandal has had italians restrained about honoring their soccer stars . until now . even after juventus coach fabio capello stepped down from his position after testifying at a match-fixing hearing on tuesday , many in italy expect a win over germany in the semi-finals would make rome erupt in a party atmosphere that would make the previous celebrations look like matchbox motorcades and could even bring back a sense of pride to a soccer-crazed people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calls for and against italy have been closely watched extra attention being paid to italians the azzurri are desperate to put in a solid showing and prove to their fans that even while a match-fixing trial is underway back home , not all of italian soccer deserves to be condemned .
the italians are paying close attention to their behavior at the same time an investigation involving four top clubs that employ half the national team continues . " they 're going to have to be attentive to their behavior , " italian players ' association president sergio campana said when the team arrived in germany .
" with all that 's going on in our sport , this team is going to be kept under the microscope even more than usual . " whenever they return home , the italians will likely be seen as in a light similar to the stage 's other tragic heroes - and not for their theatrical dives and acting on the field - after trudging through an opera set with everything from fixing team rosters to wiretaps and betting on matches . italian soccer federation prosecutor stefano palazzi called for the relegation of ac milan , juventus , lazio and fiorentina on the third day of a trial in rome where 25 people are also suspected of sporting fraud . after a short period of being embarrassed and humiliated by their players ' presence in germany during such a scandal , many italians have come to believe in their national team again . " the -lrb- italian -rrb- players here are playing for the game 's conscience and the game 's future back home , " a corriere della sera reporter told the bbc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wo n't be alone if italy beat germany returning to the team initially divided on whether to support the national team , italy 's advancement has made it harder for italy 's soccer-loving public not to support the team . " germany , we 're going to beat you ! " read a corriere dello sport headline . the daily il corriere della sera also played up support for marcello lippi 's side .
" germany against italy : we are making history . " fans outside of italy have also proved willing to spur on the azzurri . " germany won the 1990 world cup in italy , now italy have to become world champions in germany , " said rinaldo luongo , the italian owner of a dortmund pizzeria .
" that would be fair . " looking back at the history of 1982 cup victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy beat germany in 1982 to claim the title italian commentators have become more and more willing to examine , without over hyping , the similarities between the 2006 tournament and the last time italy claimed the world cup title in 1982 . though the italians also entered that tournament in spain embroiled in a match fixing scandal , it was two years old and long forgotten history as the team took the field and won the final match against germany with paolo rossi , who had earlier served a suspension for his role , claiming the cup 's golden boot . two of the four italian clubs accused of corruption , milan and lazio , where relegated in 1980 . in 2006 , it 's juventus coach capello who made the first step by resigning after the club was set to be relegated at least two divisions .

it killed about 40 jews in kielce and led to an exodus of polish jews who survived the holocaust . first came the rumors ; then came the violence .
in the end , 42 people , all but three jewish , were murdered in the polish town of kielce , in what is known as europe 's last pogrom , one year after the surrender of the nazis . for decades , this event in poland 's past lay unexamined by many poles themselves .
but now that is changing as the eu member prepares to unveil a new monument and hold ceremonies marking the day that set off an exodus of jews into exile . " each and every country has its history , " piotr kadlczik , chairman of the union of jewish communities , told polish radio .
" and in this history , it has moments of which it can be proud or ashamed .
to make a selection by thinking only about the proud moments makes this history poorer . "
one violent night on july 4 , 1946 , a rumor began to circulate that a jewish family had kidnapped a christian child and held him in a cellar overnight .
the rumor soon grew and , as rumors do , took on incredible dimensions .
word had it that the small jewish community of kielce needed to have blood transfusions from christians to exist , to make matzos , jewish unleavened bread ; skulls and skeletons were in the cellar of jewish families , due to ritual killings . the father of the missing boy - who was actually sleeping at a friend 's house - asked police to investigate .
the father , neighbors , police and members of the communist militia went to planty street , home to the town 's jews . soon after , a police officer ordered the jews to hand over their weapons , and it was then that the first shots were fired .
no one can say with certainty who opened fire on whom , but the resulting battle with guns and clubs drew in soldiers , the police and civilians , who either shot the jews or beat them to death .
some were thrown out of the windows of apartment blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only about 250,000 polish jews out of 3.5 million survived the holocaust thirty-seven jews and three non-jewish poles were killed that day .
the incident was followed by other attacks on jews in the city several days later that killed up to 1,500 jews . and it prompted polish jews - once the largest jewish community in europe numbering 3.5 million before the nazis killed 90 percent of them - to flee in droves after surviving the holocaust : in the three months following the pogrom , around 70,000 jews left poland - more than the 50,000 who had emigrated during the entire year before . " after the kielce pogrom , the situation had inexorably changed , " historian bozena szaynok of wroclaw university told afp .
" right after the war , many jews emigrated to palestine , because they saw poland as a huge cemetery where they could no longer live .
after the pogrom , there was a real atmosphere of panic among jews .
they no longer felt that poland was safe for them . " ripe for violence even though there were other smaller pogroms in hungary and romania , the post-war atmosphere in poland was particularly ripe for the kielce pogrom , historians say . " the pogrom would never have happened if not for the climate of anti-semitism in poland at the time , where jews were dehumanized , seen as having been ' punished ' in the war , and the myth of the communist jew , who brought the hated communists to power , was freely spread , " historian andrzej paczkowski told afp . " poles feared that jews who survived the war would return and demand that the homes they abandoned when they fled the nazis be returned to them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new polish jewish museum is planned in 2008 for warsaw and even though the polish government apologized for the pogrom 10 years ago , many say that poles still largely see themselves as victims during and after the war and have failed to come to terms with anti-semitism , even today . " the tragic death of polish jews is something that has never been properly mourned here , " jan t. gross , a polish-american author of books on poles and jews told the associated press .
" and the absence of mourning is something that has to be remedied because it weighs on the collective consciousness of the society . " his latest book , " fear , " is largely about the kielce pogrom and post-war anti-semitism in poland . modern anti-semitism more recently , the recent entry of the far-right league of polish families party - which has its origins in a pre-war anti-semitic party - into the conservative coalition government has raised concerns about anti-semitism in poland .
even pope benedict has warned the far right and its religious radio station , radio maryja , about its questionable comments regarding jews . and in may , poland 's chief rabbi michael schudrich was attacked in warsaw by a pole who allegedly has ties to neo-nazi groups . " there is anti-semitism in poland today , " he told the bbc .
" it , however , still does not play a significant role in society , in large measure thanks to the teachings of john paul ii .
the level of anti-semitism here is actually far less than in almost any other european country today . " after sirens wailed at 4 p.m.

it killed about 40 jews in kielce and led to an exodus of polish jews who survived the holocaust . first came the rumors ; then came the violence .
in the end , 42 people , all but three jewish , were murdered in the polish town of kielce , in what is known as europe 's last pogrom , one year after the surrender of the nazis . for decades , this event in poland 's past lay unexamined by many poles themselves .
but now that is changing as the eu member prepares to unveil a new monument and hold ceremonies marking the day that set off an exodus of jews into exile . " each and every country has its history , " piotr kadlczik , chairman of the union of jewish communities , told polish radio .
" and in this history , it has moments of which it can be proud or ashamed .
to make a selection by thinking only about the proud moments makes this history poorer . "
one violent night on july 4 , 1946 , a rumor began to circulate that a jewish family had kidnapped a christian child and held him in a cellar overnight .
the rumor soon grew and , as rumors do , took on incredible dimensions .
word had it that the small jewish community of kielce needed to have blood transfusions from christians to exist , to make matzos , jewish unleavened bread ; skulls and skeletons were in the cellar of jewish families , due to ritual killings . the father of the missing boy - who was actually sleeping at a friend 's house - asked police to investigate .
the father , neighbors , police and members of the communist militia went to planty street , home to the town 's jews . soon after , a police officer ordered the jews to hand over their weapons , and it was then that the first shots were fired .
no one can say with certainty who opened fire on whom , but the resulting battle with guns and clubs drew in soldiers , the police and civilians , who either shot the jews or beat them to death .
some were thrown out of the windows of apartment blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only about 250,000 polish jews out of 3.5 million survived the holocaust thirty-seven jews and three non-jewish poles were killed that day .

and they won there - beating argentina in a nail-biting , quarter-final climax - but they wo n't be going back to contest the world cup in the final .
germany 's dream of watching their home team raise the golden trophy in triumph ended when italy not only crashed the party but ate all the food , drank all the champagne and went home with the family silver stuffed up their shirts . for this was a smash-and-grab raid of the most heartless kind .

the germans have consigned many of their stereotypes to a history pre-2006 through welcoming the world and showing it how to party . while the post-match trauma will no doubt lead to a river of tears which will flow through the country , germany must get a grip as soon as possible if this world cup is n't going to deflate entirely .

long known for its rigid shopping laws that force stores to close at certain times and on sundays , germany is rethinking consumerism and may abolish the rules . it 's a long tradition in germany : get up early and run to the store on saturday morning to shop for the week , because you might as well forget about picking up anything on sunday . but over the past few years , shops in large german cities have begun staying open longer on weekdays and saturdays to meet consumer demand .
some crafty stores have even skirted the sunday shopping ban by claiming tourists as shoppers as these shops are allowed an exemption . but now , germany 's parliament , busy with federal reform , has decided to repeal a 1956 " store closing law " and make it easier for consumers to spend their money when they please . " germany has a too complicated and protracted decision-making process , " chancellor angela merkel told parliament last week . regional decisions the repeal of the ladenschlussgesetz -lrb- store closing law -rrb- is part of a series of 25 measures to reform the federal system to give the 16 states more power in matters of health , education , wages and prisons .
in exchange for the devolution , the federal government 's power is enhanced by cutting in half the number of laws that must be approved by state legislatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some stores such as ones in train stations are already allowed to stay open on sundays as a result , the states will be able to set their own shopping hours .
currently , stores are required to close by 8 p.m. and stay closed on sundays .
that is later than allowed until 1996 , when shops were required to close by 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and 1 p.m. on saturdays . trade unions have protested the proposed changes the law , saying it helps provide families time together and protects small businesses , which could be pushed out of the market by larger corporations that force their employees to work longer hours . despite the pushing for the reform , government officials said they hope the states do n't change current hours . " it would be good if the states do not approve more than four sundays a year that stores can stay open , " said merkel . changes ahead the reform package will be voted on july 7 by germany 's upper house of parliament .
if approved as expected , the measures will take effect in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup has led some shops to stay open on sundays but no one is coming in berlin , as well as a number of other states , officials said they plan to keep the sunday shopping ban on all but a few sundays each year but will leave other times up to store owners . still , even now in most large german cities such as berlin , munich and hamburg , it is possible to buy goods on sundays at gas stations , train station shops or in certain stores in tourist zones .
the immigrant communities , such as the turks , also often do business on sunday . meanwhile , during the world cup , many stores , such as swedish furniture giant ikea , have taken advantage of a temporary suspension of the shopping rules and have extended their store hours to remain open on sundays . however , a quick look at these stores is telling , as only a few customers can be seen strolling through the aisles as most people are out enjoying the unusually beautiful weather or watching matches dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shops to stay open longer for world cup while german soccer fans hope the home team will rack up the goals , businesses are counting on longer opening hours to fill their cash registers with euros , but not everyone is convinced it will work .

it was n't until a 3-0 win against ukraine and a spot in the semi-finals that honking , flag-waving cars hit the italian streets . while celebrations are normal occurrences at any point in an international tournament in other countries , a serious match-fixing scandal has had italians restrained about honoring their soccer stars . until now . even after juventus coach fabio capello stepped down from his position after testifying at a match-fixing hearing on tuesday , many in italy expect a win over germany in the semi-finals would make rome erupt in a party atmosphere that would make the previous celebrations look like matchbox motorcades and could even bring back a sense of pride to a soccer-crazed people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calls for and against italy have been closely watched extra attention being paid to italians the azzurri are desperate to put in a solid showing and prove to their fans that even while a match-fixing trial is underway back home , not all of italian soccer deserves to be condemned .
the italians are paying close attention to their behavior at the same time an investigation involving four top clubs that employ half the national team continues . " they 're going to have to be attentive to their behavior , " italian players ' association president sergio campana said when the team arrived in germany .
" with all that 's going on in our sport , this team is going to be kept under the microscope even more than usual . " whenever they return home , the italians will likely be seen as in a light similar to the stage 's other tragic heroes - and not for their theatrical dives and acting on the field - after trudging through an opera set with everything from fixing team rosters to wiretaps and betting on matches . italian soccer federation prosecutor stefano palazzi called for the relegation of ac milan , juventus , lazio and fiorentina on the third day of a trial in rome where 25 people are also suspected of sporting fraud . after a short period of being embarrassed and humiliated by their players ' presence in germany during such a scandal , many italians have come to believe in their national team again . " the -lrb- italian -rrb- players here are playing for the game 's conscience and the game 's future back home , " a corriere della sera reporter told the bbc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wo n't be alone if italy beat germany returning to the team initially divided on whether to support the national team , italy 's advancement has made it harder for italy 's soccer-loving public not to support the team .

" germany against italy : we are making history . " fans outside of italy have also proved willing to spur on the azzurri . " germany won the 1990 world cup in italy , now italy have to become world champions in germany , " said rinaldo luongo , the italian owner of a dortmund pizzeria .
" that would be fair . " looking back at the history of 1982 cup victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy beat germany in 1982 to claim the title italian commentators have become more and more willing to examine , without over hyping , the similarities between the 2006 tournament and the last time italy claimed the world cup title in 1982 . though the italians also entered that tournament in spain embroiled in a match fixing scandal , it was two years old and long forgotten history as the team took the field and won the final match against germany with paolo rossi , who had earlier served a suspension for his role , claiming the cup 's golden boot . two of the four italian clubs accused of corruption , milan and lazio , where relegated in 1980 . in 2006 , it 's juventus coach capello who made the first step by resigning after the club was set to be relegated at least two divisions .

surrounded by the euphoria of seeing the national team move into the semi-finals , germans are going to unusual lengths to make sure they enjoy the game and - hopefully - post-match celebrations . an event that comes around only once every four years , germany is pulling out all the stops to make sure as many people as possible experience the world cup on home soil to the fullest . take the example of a munich politician concerned about school kids ' sleeping habits . worried that students ' mathematical ability will be limited to tallying goals after a late night of watching germany play italy in the world cup semi-finals , munich social democrat franz maget wanted students get some extra sleep after the game and before trudging off to school . maget suggested starting the state 's schools 30 minutes later to cut down on eye rubbing after tuesday night 's 9:00 p.m. kick-off . " school children also want to see the game , " he said , adding that a penalty shoot-out , such as the one germany needed to beat argentina , could keep kids up long past their bedtime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one last look , then i 'm headed to watch the game soccer mania surpasses car craze some german car companies have also come to terms with the fact that , even in a country as automobile crazy as germany , repair rates for cars made after tuesday 's 9:00 p.m. kick-off could skyrocket as employees ' ability to concentrate on the job plummets when die mannschaft take on the azzurri in dortmund . daimlerchrysler decided to cut one shift from the production schedule in sindelfingen so some 10,000 workers can watch the game .
porsche and bmw are also fiddling with their shifts times to allow staff to clock out in time to catch the game . many deutsche bahn employees , however , will be stuck listening to the radio as the rail company puts about 100 more trains on the tracks to help soccer fans get where they are going , and dortmund airport has registered 107 extra flights with more than 1,500 passengers , many of which are coming from italy , according to airport and border control officials . " everything we have that has wheels on it will be rolling on july 4 , " said hubert jung , head of dortmund 's local transportation authority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's nothing quite like cracking open a can of stadium air !
a breath of sweaty , beery arena air even with the extra transportation , not everyone is going to make it to the city , but a bochum-based company wants to make sure soccer fans still get a whiff of the action . stadionluft has filled 25,000 cans with " original stadium air " from the dortmund grounds and put them on sale for 4.95 euros -lrb- $ 6.34 -rrb- per can for the people who are stuck without a ticket but still want to experience the scent that can comes from a fresh pitch mixed with beer and sausages . regardless of where people watch , the german red cross has three tips for fans watching the games outside : put on sunscreen ; choose sturdy footwear over flip flops ; and drink lots of water instead of alcohol . at least two out of three should n't prove too difficult . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de offsides from the fringe soccer : it 's a funny ol ' game .

it killed about 40 jews in kielce and led to an exodus of polish jews who survived the holocaust . first came the rumors ; then came the violence .
in the end , 42 people , all but three jewish , were murdered in the polish town of kielce , in what is known as europe 's last pogrom , one year after the surrender of the nazis . for decades , this event in poland 's past lay unexamined by many poles themselves .
but now that is changing as the eu member prepares to unveil a new monument and hold ceremonies marking the day that set off an exodus of jews into exile . " each and every country has its history , " piotr kadlczik , chairman of the union of jewish communities , told polish radio .
" and in this history , it has moments of which it can be proud or ashamed .
to make a selection by thinking only about the proud moments makes this history poorer . "
one violent night on july 4 , 1946 , a rumor began to circulate that a jewish family had kidnapped a christian child and held him in a cellar overnight .
the rumor soon grew and , as rumors do , took on incredible dimensions .
word had it that the small jewish community of kielce needed to have blood transfusions from christians to exist , to make matzos , jewish unleavened bread ; skulls and skeletons were in the cellar of jewish families , due to ritual killings . the father of the missing boy - who was actually sleeping at a friend 's house - asked police to investigate .
the father , neighbors , police and members of the communist militia went to planty street , home to the town 's jews . soon after , a police officer ordered the jews to hand over their weapons , and it was then that the first shots were fired .
no one can say with certainty who opened fire on whom , but the resulting battle with guns and clubs drew in soldiers , the police and civilians , who either shot the jews or beat them to death .
some were thrown out of the windows of apartment blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only about 250,000 polish jews out of 3.5 million survived the holocaust thirty-seven jews and three non-jewish poles were killed that day .
the incident was followed by other attacks on jews in the city several days later that killed up to 1,500 jews . and it prompted polish jews - once the largest jewish community in europe numbering 3.5 million before the nazis killed 90 percent of them - to flee in droves after surviving the holocaust : in the three months following the pogrom , around 70,000 jews left poland - more than the 50,000 who had emigrated during the entire year before . " after the kielce pogrom , the situation had inexorably changed , " historian bozena szaynok of wroclaw university told afp .
" right after the war , many jews emigrated to palestine , because they saw poland as a huge cemetery where they could no longer live .
after the pogrom , there was a real atmosphere of panic among jews .
they no longer felt that poland was safe for them . " ripe for violence even though there were other smaller pogroms in hungary and romania , the post-war atmosphere in poland was particularly ripe for the kielce pogrom , historians say . " the pogrom would never have happened if not for the climate of anti-semitism in poland at the time , where jews were dehumanized , seen as having been ' punished ' in the war , and the myth of the communist jew , who brought the hated communists to power , was freely spread , " historian andrzej paczkowski told afp . " poles feared that jews who survived the war would return and demand that the homes they abandoned when they fled the nazis be returned to them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new polish jewish museum is planned in 2008 for warsaw and even though the polish government apologized for the pogrom 10 years ago , many say that poles still largely see themselves as victims during and after the war and have failed to come to terms with anti-semitism , even today . " the tragic death of polish jews is something that has never been properly mourned here , " jan t. gross , a polish-american author of books on poles and jews told the associated press .
" and the absence of mourning is something that has to be remedied because it weighs on the collective consciousness of the society . " his latest book , " fear , " is largely about the kielce pogrom and post-war anti-semitism in poland . modern anti-semitism more recently , the recent entry of the far-right league of polish families party - which has its origins in a pre-war anti-semitic party - into the conservative coalition government has raised concerns about anti-semitism in poland .
even pope benedict has warned the far right and its religious radio station , radio maryja , about its questionable comments regarding jews . and in may , poland 's chief rabbi michael schudrich was attacked in warsaw by a pole who allegedly has ties to neo-nazi groups . " there is anti-semitism in poland today , " he told the bbc .
" it , however , still does not play a significant role in society , in large measure thanks to the teachings of john paul ii .
the level of anti-semitism here is actually far less than in almost any other european country today . " after sirens wailed at 4 p.m.
tuesday , schudrich led jewish prayers at the ceremonies after the unveiling of a monument to the victims - and trees commemorating the victims have also been planted as a reminder of the town 's sad history . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former polish skinhead appointed to high public post the former editor of a polish neo-nazi magazine has been appointed as deputy chairman of poland 's public tv network , sending shockwaves through the new eu member country .

it killed about 40 jews in kielce and led to an exodus of polish jews who survived the holocaust . first came the rumors ; then came the violence .
in the end , 42 people , all but three jewish , were murdered in the polish town of kielce , in what is known as europe 's last pogrom , one year after the surrender of the nazis . for decades , this event in poland 's past lay unexamined by many poles themselves .
but now that is changing as the eu member prepares to unveil a new monument and hold ceremonies marking the day that set off an exodus of jews into exile . " each and every country has its history , " piotr kadlczik , chairman of the union of jewish communities , told polish radio .
" and in this history , it has moments of which it can be proud or ashamed .
to make a selection by thinking only about the proud moments makes this history poorer . "
one violent night on july 4 , 1946 , a rumor began to circulate that a jewish family had kidnapped a christian child and held him in a cellar overnight .
the rumor soon grew and , as rumors do , took on incredible dimensions .
word had it that the small jewish community of kielce needed to have blood transfusions from christians to exist , to make matzos , jewish unleavened bread ; skulls and skeletons were in the cellar of jewish families , due to ritual killings . the father of the missing boy - who was actually sleeping at a friend 's house - asked police to investigate .
the father , neighbors , police and members of the communist militia went to planty street , home to the town 's jews . soon after , a police officer ordered the jews to hand over their weapons , and it was then that the first shots were fired .
no one can say with certainty who opened fire on whom , but the resulting battle with guns and clubs drew in soldiers , the police and civilians , who either shot the jews or beat them to death .
some were thrown out of the windows of apartment blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only about 250,000 polish jews out of 3.5 million survived the holocaust thirty-seven jews and three non-jewish poles were killed that day .
the incident was followed by other attacks on jews in the city several days later that killed up to 1,500 jews . and it prompted polish jews - once the largest jewish community in europe numbering 3.5 million before the nazis killed 90 percent of them - to flee in droves after surviving the holocaust : in the three months following the pogrom , around 70,000 jews left poland - more than the 50,000 who had emigrated during the entire year before .

the whole country goes into mourning but dw-world.de believes germany still has plenty to celebrate even though the dream is now over . " we 're going to berlin " the euphoric fans were singing .
even those travelling to fan fests and bars all over germany were singing the refrain ; not a joyous exclamation of their actual destination but a song proclaiming the widely held belief that germany 's destiny was the world cup final in the capital on july 9 . they did get to berlin , on june 30 .
and they won there - beating argentina in a nail-biting , quarter-final climax - but they wo n't be going back to contest the world cup in the final .
germany 's dream of watching their home team raise the golden trophy in triumph ended when italy not only crashed the party but ate all the food , drank all the champagne and went home with the family silver stuffed up their shirts . for this was a smash-and-grab raid of the most heartless kind .
germany - not so much a country in the last few weeks , but a living , breathing unified entity - was ready to follows its team along its pre-destined path to the title and to then fall into a rapture which would quite possibly never end . that was the belief .
the country was riding a wave unlike anything felt in the last 15 years .
it was not only a hope that germany would win but it seemed to be a very poorly kept secret among the white-shirted millions which had turned a recently depressed and morose nation into the world 's biggest festival site .
no one doubted the outcome . klinsi 's kids came from nowhere to bring hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was supposed to be so different it was all very different before the world cup .
jürgen klinsmann 's team was already written-off before the first ball was kicked in anger .
but when the action started , this team of youngsters showed a desire and flair that no-one , not even the most enthusiastic fan , would have expected . but when the players started to deliver in such style , the country started to wonder .
and then they started to hope .
then they started to believe .
it was infectious and the team 's performances seemed to flow with an energy generated from hamburg to munich , from cologne to berlin . this is why the italian victory is such a blow to germany .
any team would be deflated by defeat , leaving the world stage to others who will compete for the trophy they thought they were destined to lift .
a country which wanted a world cup win on home soil so badly can only feel an emotion close to bereavement after such a loss . positive vibe must continue in host nation but while the bubble has so cruelly burst , there are huge positives to take from germany 's world cup experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans should be proud of their team and their world cup as a team , germany actually performed above all expectations and should be honoured and proud of their showing .
they should harness this new attacking flair , nurture it further and come back even stronger , possibly creating a new german legacy of soccer dominance in the future . as a people , the germans should refuse to let such a defeat rob them of their new enthusiasm and to channel the pride in their country and the new respect from outside their borders into a new positive way of living .
they have showed that germany can be an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the germans have consigned many of their stereotypes to a history pre-2006 through welcoming the world and showing it how to party . while the post-match trauma will no doubt lead to a river of tears which will flow through the country , germany must get a grip as soon as possible if this world cup is n't going to deflate entirely .
the germans now have a responsibility to put on their make-up once more , hold the flags proudly aloft again and continue to sing of travelling to berlin .
because the final party is not going to be anywhere near as fun without the hosts in attendance . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hope win in germany eases scandal at home after an initial ambivalence concerning their team 's world cup chances , italians have come around to supporting the azzurri in their semi-final match against hosts germany .

surrounded by the euphoria of seeing the national team move into the semi-finals , germans are going to unusual lengths to make sure they enjoy the game and - hopefully - post-match celebrations . an event that comes around only once every four years , germany is pulling out all the stops to make sure as many people as possible experience the world cup on home soil to the fullest . take the example of a munich politician concerned about school kids ' sleeping habits . worried that students ' mathematical ability will be limited to tallying goals after a late night of watching germany play italy in the world cup semi-finals , munich social democrat franz maget wanted students get some extra sleep after the game and before trudging off to school . maget suggested starting the state 's schools 30 minutes later to cut down on eye rubbing after tuesday night 's 9:00 p.m. kick-off . " school children also want to see the game , " he said , adding that a penalty shoot-out , such as the one germany needed to beat argentina , could keep kids up long past their bedtime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one last look , then i 'm headed to watch the game soccer mania surpasses car craze some german car companies have also come to terms with the fact that , even in a country as automobile crazy as germany , repair rates for cars made after tuesday 's 9:00 p.m. kick-off could skyrocket as employees ' ability to concentrate on the job plummets when die mannschaft take on the azzurri in dortmund . daimlerchrysler decided to cut one shift from the production schedule in sindelfingen so some 10,000 workers can watch the game .
porsche and bmw are also fiddling with their shifts times to allow staff to clock out in time to catch the game . many deutsche bahn employees , however , will be stuck listening to the radio as the rail company puts about 100 more trains on the tracks to help soccer fans get where they are going , and dortmund airport has registered 107 extra flights with more than 1,500 passengers , many of which are coming from italy , according to airport and border control officials . " everything we have that has wheels on it will be rolling on july 4 , " said hubert jung , head of dortmund 's local transportation authority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's nothing quite like cracking open a can of stadium air !
a breath of sweaty , beery arena air even with the extra transportation , not everyone is going to make it to the city , but a bochum-based company wants to make sure soccer fans still get a whiff of the action . stadionluft has filled 25,000 cans with " original stadium air " from the dortmund grounds and put them on sale for 4.95 euros -lrb- $ 6.34 -rrb- per can for the people who are stuck without a ticket but still want to experience the scent that can comes from a fresh pitch mixed with beer and sausages . regardless of where people watch , the german red cross has three tips for fans watching the games outside : put on sunscreen ; choose sturdy footwear over flip flops ; and drink lots of water instead of alcohol . at least two out of three should n't prove too difficult . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de offsides from the fringe soccer : it 's a funny ol ' game .

it was n't until a 3-0 win against ukraine and a spot in the semi-finals that honking , flag-waving cars hit the italian streets . while celebrations are normal occurrences at any point in an international tournament in other countries , a serious match-fixing scandal has had italians restrained about honoring their soccer stars . until now . even after juventus coach fabio capello stepped down from his position after testifying at a match-fixing hearing on tuesday , many in italy expect a win over germany in the semi-finals would make rome erupt in a party atmosphere that would make the previous celebrations look like matchbox motorcades and could even bring back a sense of pride to a soccer-crazed people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calls for and against italy have been closely watched extra attention being paid to italians the azzurri are desperate to put in a solid showing and prove to their fans that even while a match-fixing trial is underway back home , not all of italian soccer deserves to be condemned .
the italians are paying close attention to their behavior at the same time an investigation involving four top clubs that employ half the national team continues . " they 're going to have to be attentive to their behavior , " italian players ' association president sergio campana said when the team arrived in germany .
" with all that 's going on in our sport , this team is going to be kept under the microscope even more than usual . " whenever they return home , the italians will likely be seen as in a light similar to the stage 's other tragic heroes - and not for their theatrical dives and acting on the field - after trudging through an opera set with everything from fixing team rosters to wiretaps and betting on matches . italian soccer federation prosecutor stefano palazzi called for the relegation of ac milan , juventus , lazio and fiorentina on the third day of a trial in rome where 25 people are also suspected of sporting fraud . after a short period of being embarrassed and humiliated by their players ' presence in germany during such a scandal , many italians have come to believe in their national team again . " the -lrb- italian -rrb- players here are playing for the game 's conscience and the game 's future back home , " a corriere della sera reporter told the bbc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wo n't be alone if italy beat germany returning to the team initially divided on whether to support the national team , italy 's advancement has made it harder for italy 's soccer-loving public not to support the team . " germany , we 're going to beat you ! " read a corriere dello sport headline . the daily il corriere della sera also played up support for marcello lippi 's side .
" germany against italy : we are making history . " fans outside of italy have also proved willing to spur on the azzurri . " germany won the 1990 world cup in italy , now italy have to become world champions in germany , " said rinaldo luongo , the italian owner of a dortmund pizzeria .
" that would be fair . " looking back at the history of 1982 cup victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy beat germany in 1982 to claim the title italian commentators have become more and more willing to examine , without over hyping , the similarities between the 2006 tournament and the last time italy claimed the world cup title in 1982 . though the italians also entered that tournament in spain embroiled in a match fixing scandal , it was two years old and long forgotten history as the team took the field and won the final match against germany with paolo rossi , who had earlier served a suspension for his role , claiming the cup 's golden boot . two of the four italian clubs accused of corruption , milan and lazio , where relegated in 1980 . in 2006 , it 's juventus coach capello who made the first step by resigning after the club was set to be relegated at least two divisions .

german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- has come under fire over a new health reform deal proposed on monday . according to the deal which was hammered out after late-night talks sunday , healthcare contributions paid by employees and their employers will increase from the beginning of next year by around half a percentage point to help close a massive funding gap . in addition , around 1.5 billion in tax revenue will go toward health insurance for children in 2008 and double that amount in 2009 . " this is an important breakthrough we have succeeded in making , " merkel said monday after the late-night huddle . however , a day later finance minister peer steinbrück said the financing plans for children 's healthcare were not yet fixed .
in tuesday 's edition of the handelsblatt daily , steinbrück said " we have not yet agreed to the finance format . " merkel 's health reform thwarts the plan by the spd coalition partners , who had sought an increase in tax to meet the funding shortfall .
merkel rejected the tax hike partly because the electorate already faces a rise in sales tax next year . spd critical of health reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat leader , kurt beck on tuesday , the leader of the spd , kurt beck , told the daily mainzer allgemeinen zeitung he had hoped to be able to lower contributions but that " one has to make compromises in a coalition . "
in the end , " patients would be the winners " of the deal , he said . the reforms drew the ire of guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , the biggest opposition group .
westerwelle said the proposals reminded him of a planned economy and had " nothing to do with free competition . "
westerwelle accused the coalition government of using the distraction around the football world cup to " cash up . " industry says health reforms stifle employment big business has argued that the reforms will make it even more expensive to hire new employees .
statutory healthcare costs are currently 14 percent of an employee 's wage , split between worker and employer . the president of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , ludwig georg braun told the daily neuen osnabrücker zeitung on tuesday that the increase in non-wage labor costs means that firms wo n't be able afford to expand their workforce .
he called for set health care contributions independent of wages . the head of the panel of six economic advisors to the government , bert rürup , called the reform a " rather modest compromise based on the lowest common denominator . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics says germany 's health care system is too bureaucratic germany 's 123-year-old public health system is widely criticized for its bloated bureaucracy and lack of transparency . according the organization for economic co-operation and development , germany spends close to 11 percent of its gross domestic product on healthcare , more than france , austria , the netherlands , italy , britain and spain . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government agrees on health , corporate tax reform germany 's ruling coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- said after all-night talks that it had agreed on parts of key reforms to healthcare and corporate taxation .
-lrb- july 3 , 2006 -rrb- german health system not quite in intensive care going by media reports and public opinion in germany , one might think the country 's health care system is sclerotic and near collapse .
but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- vat increase puts germany closer to eu average the 3 percent value-added tax increase that was part of chancellor angela merkel 's election campaign did n't come as a surprise to anyone in germany , but that does n't mean everyone is willing to accept it .

german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- has come under fire over a new health reform deal proposed on monday . according to the deal which was hammered out after late-night talks sunday , healthcare contributions paid by employees and their employers will increase from the beginning of next year by around half a percentage point to help close a massive funding gap . in addition , around 1.5 billion in tax revenue will go toward health insurance for children in 2008 and double that amount in 2009 . " this is an important breakthrough we have succeeded in making , " merkel said monday after the late-night huddle . however , a day later finance minister peer steinbrück said the financing plans for children 's healthcare were not yet fixed .
in tuesday 's edition of the handelsblatt daily , steinbrück said " we have not yet agreed to the finance format . " merkel 's health reform thwarts the plan by the spd coalition partners , who had sought an increase in tax to meet the funding shortfall .
merkel rejected the tax hike partly because the electorate already faces a rise in sales tax next year . spd critical of health reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat leader , kurt beck on tuesday , the leader of the spd , kurt beck , told the daily mainzer allgemeinen zeitung he had hoped to be able to lower contributions but that " one has to make compromises in a coalition . "
in the end , " patients would be the winners " of the deal , he said . the reforms drew the ire of guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , the biggest opposition group .
westerwelle said the proposals reminded him of a planned economy and had " nothing to do with free competition . "
westerwelle accused the coalition government of using the distraction around the football world cup to " cash up . " industry says health reforms stifle employment big business has argued that the reforms will make it even more expensive to hire new employees .
statutory healthcare costs are currently 14 percent of an employee 's wage , split between worker and employer . the president of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , ludwig georg braun told the daily neuen osnabrücker zeitung on tuesday that the increase in non-wage labor costs means that firms wo n't be able afford to expand their workforce .
he called for set health care contributions independent of wages . the head of the panel of six economic advisors to the government , bert rürup , called the reform a " rather modest compromise based on the lowest common denominator . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics says germany 's health care system is too bureaucratic germany 's 123-year-old public health system is widely criticized for its bloated bureaucracy and lack of transparency . according the organization for economic co-operation and development , germany spends close to 11 percent of its gross domestic product on healthcare , more than france , austria , the netherlands , italy , britain and spain . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government agrees on health , corporate tax reform germany 's ruling coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- said after all-night talks that it had agreed on parts of key reforms to healthcare and corporate taxation .
-lrb- july 3 , 2006 -rrb- german health system not quite in intensive care going by media reports and public opinion in germany , one might think the country 's health care system is sclerotic and near collapse .
but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- vat increase puts germany closer to eu average the 3 percent value-added tax increase that was part of chancellor angela merkel 's election campaign did n't come as a surprise to anyone in germany , but that does n't mean everyone is willing to accept it .

long known for its rigid shopping laws that force stores to close at certain times and on sundays , germany is rethinking consumerism and may abolish the rules . it 's a long tradition in germany : get up early and run to the store on saturday morning to shop for the week , because you might as well forget about picking up anything on sunday . but over the past few years , shops in large german cities have begun staying open longer on weekdays and saturdays to meet consumer demand .
some crafty stores have even skirted the sunday shopping ban by claiming tourists as shoppers as these shops are allowed an exemption . but now , germany 's parliament , busy with federal reform , has decided to repeal a 1956 " store closing law " and make it easier for consumers to spend their money when they please . " germany has a too complicated and protracted decision-making process , " chancellor angela merkel told parliament last week . regional decisions the repeal of the ladenschlussgesetz -lrb- store closing law -rrb- is part of a series of 25 measures to reform the federal system to give the 16 states more power in matters of health , education , wages and prisons .
in exchange for the devolution , the federal government 's power is enhanced by cutting in half the number of laws that must be approved by state legislatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some stores such as ones in train stations are already allowed to stay open on sundays as a result , the states will be able to set their own shopping hours .

" we 're already highly focused , " germany team manager oliver bierhoff said .
" we 're really looking forward to playing in dortmund .
that 'll really be an advantage for us , since the atmosphere should be unbelievable . " germany have never lost in dortmund , winning 13 of their 14 internationals played there . but italy can take heart from their excellent record against germany in the world cup with two wins and two draws in four meetings , including epic victories in the 1970 semi-final and the 1982 final . francesco totti , whose performance in the 3-0 quarter-final win over ukraine was his best of the tournament so far , wants italy to emulate the great azzurri teams of the past by adding another famous victory against their old foes . dortmund crowd a boost for germans , challenge for italians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans have great memories of the 1-0 win against poland in dortmund " on tuesday we want to write another chapter in the duel , " said the roma captain .
" to beat germany in their own country in front of a hostile crowd , well it could n't get any better than that . " despite some unconvincing performances on their way to the semis , italy boast a 23-match unbeaten run - their best streak since 1939 - and defender fabio grosso believes they can break german hearts at the westfalenstadion . " we 're taking on a great team that has the backing of the whole country , but we believe in ourselves , " grosso said .
" we need to play like we know how and put them in difficulty . " friendly defeat belongs in history books bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans are convinced they wo n't be leaving the field with the heads against italy again italy showed the germans just how difficult they can be with a humiliating 4-1 drubbing in a friendly four months ago , leading much of the german press to call for coach jürgen klinsmann 's head .
but italian trainer marcello lippi insisted that result will have no bearing on tuesday 's clash . " we wo n't score four goals against germany again , " lippi said .
" they 're not the same side we met in march .
now they are exploiting the enthusiasm of the whole nation and it has transformed them . " bierhoff added that 4-1 loss was " no longer a reference point " for the german team . " the defeat really scarred us , and we played absolutely awfully , " he said .
" now we 're on top form though , both mentally and physically , and there 's no way that something like that could ever happen again . " klinsmann , who stated winning the tournament on home soil is his only goal , added that his side is capable of beating the azzurri . " italy are one of the best teams in the world , and that is why they are in the final four , " said klinsmann .
" but we think if we play our own game we can beat them .
i believe the confidence that we have built over the last six weeks is enough to win the next two games and become world champions . " crucial players missing on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings was suspended for having a role in a post-match brawl italy defender alessandro nesta is almost certain to miss his third straight match due to a groin strain , while germany will be without midfielder torsten frings , who was suspended for the semi-final by fifa , world soccer 's governing body , for his role in a scuffle following germany 's match against argentina . the hosts will be able to keep captain michael ballack on the roster .
a question mark remained next to his name after serious cramps during the team 's quarter-final . fifa statistics show the germans are the most offensively minded of the teams in the 2006 tournament with 88 shots on goal , while the italians have proved to be nearly unbeatable in their own penalty area by giving up just one goal - an own goal . the winner of tuesday 's game will go on to face either portugal or france in the final in berlin on july 9 .

the swiss cabinet in june rejected calls to tighten restrictions on the practice , after concerns that dignitas , an organization which assists with suicides , killed a woman who had simply falsified her medical records to show a terminal illness in order to ' qualify ' for the procedure . switzerland has by far the most liberal law in this respect in europe .
france and germany currently ban the practice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cathedral in freiburg .
the city 's archbishop is against assisted suicide the three bishops said support for assisted suicide was based on the false perception that humans should be independent , productive and healthy . sickness not a burden freiberg 's archbishop zollitsch told the press conference that " at present , sick , suffering and dying people are seen as a burden to be disposed of . " archbishop doré said the bishops did not support artificially prolonging someone 's life .
he said stopping an ineffective treatment can allow patients to " die in dignity " , but stressed that " death should not be caused , or supported by a doctor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sick people are not a burden , bishops say a dying person should have a humane assistance and a space to come to terms with their own death , the bishops said . it is the second time the three bishops from the neighboring cities have sent out a combined pastoral letter .

the whole country goes into mourning but dw-world.de believes germany still has plenty to celebrate even though the dream is now over . " we 're going to berlin " the euphoric fans were singing .
even those travelling to fan fests and bars all over germany were singing the refrain ; not a joyous exclamation of their actual destination but a song proclaiming the widely held belief that germany 's destiny was the world cup final in the capital on july 9 . they did get to berlin , on june 30 .
and they won there - beating argentina in a nail-biting , quarter-final climax - but they wo n't be going back to contest the world cup in the final .
germany 's dream of watching their home team raise the golden trophy in triumph ended when italy not only crashed the party but ate all the food , drank all the champagne and went home with the family silver stuffed up their shirts . for this was a smash-and-grab raid of the most heartless kind .
germany - not so much a country in the last few weeks , but a living , breathing unified entity - was ready to follows its team along its pre-destined path to the title and to then fall into a rapture which would quite possibly never end . that was the belief .
the country was riding a wave unlike anything felt in the last 15 years .
it was not only a hope that germany would win but it seemed to be a very poorly kept secret among the white-shirted millions which had turned a recently depressed and morose nation into the world 's biggest festival site .
no one doubted the outcome . klinsi 's kids came from nowhere to bring hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was supposed to be so different it was all very different before the world cup .
jürgen klinsmann 's team was already written-off before the first ball was kicked in anger .
but when the action started , this team of youngsters showed a desire and flair that no-one , not even the most enthusiastic fan , would have expected . but when the players started to deliver in such style , the country started to wonder .
and then they started to hope .
then they started to believe .
it was infectious and the team 's performances seemed to flow with an energy generated from hamburg to munich , from cologne to berlin . this is why the italian victory is such a blow to germany .
any team would be deflated by defeat , leaving the world stage to others who will compete for the trophy they thought they were destined to lift .
a country which wanted a world cup win on home soil so badly can only feel an emotion close to bereavement after such a loss . positive vibe must continue in host nation but while the bubble has so cruelly burst , there are huge positives to take from germany 's world cup experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans should be proud of their team and their world cup as a team , germany actually performed above all expectations and should be honoured and proud of their showing .
they should harness this new attacking flair , nurture it further and come back even stronger , possibly creating a new german legacy of soccer dominance in the future . as a people , the germans should refuse to let such a defeat rob them of their new enthusiasm and to channel the pride in their country and the new respect from outside their borders into a new positive way of living .
they have showed that germany can be an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the germans have consigned many of their stereotypes to a history pre-2006 through welcoming the world and showing it how to party . while the post-match trauma will no doubt lead to a river of tears which will flow through the country , germany must get a grip as soon as possible if this world cup is n't going to deflate entirely .
the germans now have a responsibility to put on their make-up once more , hold the flags proudly aloft again and continue to sing of travelling to berlin .
because the final party is not going to be anywhere near as fun without the hosts in attendance . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hope win in germany eases scandal at home after an initial ambivalence concerning their team 's world cup chances , italians have come around to supporting the azzurri in their semi-final match against hosts germany .

it was n't until a 3-0 win against ukraine and a spot in the semi-finals that honking , flag-waving cars hit the italian streets . while celebrations are normal occurrences at any point in an international tournament in other countries , a serious match-fixing scandal has had italians restrained about honoring their soccer stars . until now . even after juventus coach fabio capello stepped down from his position after testifying at a match-fixing hearing on tuesday , many in italy expect a win over germany in the semi-finals would make rome erupt in a party atmosphere that would make the previous celebrations look like matchbox motorcades and could even bring back a sense of pride to a soccer-crazed people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calls for and against italy have been closely watched extra attention being paid to italians the azzurri are desperate to put in a solid showing and prove to their fans that even while a match-fixing trial is underway back home , not all of italian soccer deserves to be condemned .
the italians are paying close attention to their behavior at the same time an investigation involving four top clubs that employ half the national team continues . " they 're going to have to be attentive to their behavior , " italian players ' association president sergio campana said when the team arrived in germany .
" with all that 's going on in our sport , this team is going to be kept under the microscope even more than usual . " whenever they return home , the italians will likely be seen as in a light similar to the stage 's other tragic heroes - and not for their theatrical dives and acting on the field - after trudging through an opera set with everything from fixing team rosters to wiretaps and betting on matches . italian soccer federation prosecutor stefano palazzi called for the relegation of ac milan , juventus , lazio and fiorentina on the third day of a trial in rome where 25 people are also suspected of sporting fraud . after a short period of being embarrassed and humiliated by their players ' presence in germany during such a scandal , many italians have come to believe in their national team again . " the -lrb- italian -rrb- players here are playing for the game 's conscience and the game 's future back home , " a corriere della sera reporter told the bbc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wo n't be alone if italy beat germany returning to the team initially divided on whether to support the national team , italy 's advancement has made it harder for italy 's soccer-loving public not to support the team . " germany , we 're going to beat you ! " read a corriere dello sport headline . the daily il corriere della sera also played up support for marcello lippi 's side .
" germany against italy : we are making history . " fans outside of italy have also proved willing to spur on the azzurri . " germany won the 1990 world cup in italy , now italy have to become world champions in germany , " said rinaldo luongo , the italian owner of a dortmund pizzeria .

it killed about 40 jews in kielce and led to an exodus of polish jews who survived the holocaust . first came the rumors ; then came the violence .
in the end , 42 people , all but three jewish , were murdered in the polish town of kielce , in what is known as europe 's last pogrom , one year after the surrender of the nazis . for decades , this event in poland 's past lay unexamined by many poles themselves .
but now that is changing as the eu member prepares to unveil a new monument and hold ceremonies marking the day that set off an exodus of jews into exile . " each and every country has its history , " piotr kadlczik , chairman of the union of jewish communities , told polish radio .
" and in this history , it has moments of which it can be proud or ashamed .
to make a selection by thinking only about the proud moments makes this history poorer . "
one violent night on july 4 , 1946 , a rumor began to circulate that a jewish family had kidnapped a christian child and held him in a cellar overnight .
the rumor soon grew and , as rumors do , took on incredible dimensions .
word had it that the small jewish community of kielce needed to have blood transfusions from christians to exist , to make matzos , jewish unleavened bread ; skulls and skeletons were in the cellar of jewish families , due to ritual killings . the father of the missing boy - who was actually sleeping at a friend 's house - asked police to investigate .
the father , neighbors , police and members of the communist militia went to planty street , home to the town 's jews . soon after , a police officer ordered the jews to hand over their weapons , and it was then that the first shots were fired .
no one can say with certainty who opened fire on whom , but the resulting battle with guns and clubs drew in soldiers , the police and civilians , who either shot the jews or beat them to death .
some were thrown out of the windows of apartment blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only about 250,000 polish jews out of 3.5 million survived the holocaust thirty-seven jews and three non-jewish poles were killed that day .
the incident was followed by other attacks on jews in the city several days later that killed up to 1,500 jews . and it prompted polish jews - once the largest jewish community in europe numbering 3.5 million before the nazis killed 90 percent of them - to flee in droves after surviving the holocaust : in the three months following the pogrom , around 70,000 jews left poland - more than the 50,000 who had emigrated during the entire year before . " after the kielce pogrom , the situation had inexorably changed , " historian bozena szaynok of wroclaw university told afp .
" right after the war , many jews emigrated to palestine , because they saw poland as a huge cemetery where they could no longer live .
after the pogrom , there was a real atmosphere of panic among jews .
they no longer felt that poland was safe for them . " ripe for violence even though there were other smaller pogroms in hungary and romania , the post-war atmosphere in poland was particularly ripe for the kielce pogrom , historians say . " the pogrom would never have happened if not for the climate of anti-semitism in poland at the time , where jews were dehumanized , seen as having been ' punished ' in the war , and the myth of the communist jew , who brought the hated communists to power , was freely spread , " historian andrzej paczkowski told afp . " poles feared that jews who survived the war would return and demand that the homes they abandoned when they fled the nazis be returned to them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new polish jewish museum is planned in 2008 for warsaw and even though the polish government apologized for the pogrom 10 years ago , many say that poles still largely see themselves as victims during and after the war and have failed to come to terms with anti-semitism , even today . " the tragic death of polish jews is something that has never been properly mourned here , " jan t. gross , a polish-american author of books on poles and jews told the associated press .
" and the absence of mourning is something that has to be remedied because it weighs on the collective consciousness of the society . " his latest book , " fear , " is largely about the kielce pogrom and post-war anti-semitism in poland . modern anti-semitism more recently , the recent entry of the far-right league of polish families party - which has its origins in a pre-war anti-semitic party - into the conservative coalition government has raised concerns about anti-semitism in poland .
even pope benedict has warned the far right and its religious radio station , radio maryja , about its questionable comments regarding jews . and in may , poland 's chief rabbi michael schudrich was attacked in warsaw by a pole who allegedly has ties to neo-nazi groups . " there is anti-semitism in poland today , " he told the bbc .
" it , however , still does not play a significant role in society , in large measure thanks to the teachings of john paul ii .
the level of anti-semitism here is actually far less than in almost any other european country today . " after sirens wailed at 4 p.m.
tuesday , schudrich led jewish prayers at the ceremonies after the unveiling of a monument to the victims - and trees commemorating the victims have also been planted as a reminder of the town 's sad history . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former polish skinhead appointed to high public post the former editor of a polish neo-nazi magazine has been appointed as deputy chairman of poland 's public tv network , sending shockwaves through the new eu member country .

it killed about 40 jews in kielce and led to an exodus of polish jews who survived the holocaust . first came the rumors ; then came the violence .
in the end , 42 people , all but three jewish , were murdered in the polish town of kielce , in what is known as europe 's last pogrom , one year after the surrender of the nazis . for decades , this event in poland 's past lay unexamined by many poles themselves .
but now that is changing as the eu member prepares to unveil a new monument and hold ceremonies marking the day that set off an exodus of jews into exile . " each and every country has its history , " piotr kadlczik , chairman of the union of jewish communities , told polish radio .
" and in this history , it has moments of which it can be proud or ashamed .
to make a selection by thinking only about the proud moments makes this history poorer . "
one violent night on july 4 , 1946 , a rumor began to circulate that a jewish family had kidnapped a christian child and held him in a cellar overnight .
the rumor soon grew and , as rumors do , took on incredible dimensions .
word had it that the small jewish community of kielce needed to have blood transfusions from christians to exist , to make matzos , jewish unleavened bread ; skulls and skeletons were in the cellar of jewish families , due to ritual killings . the father of the missing boy - who was actually sleeping at a friend 's house - asked police to investigate .
the father , neighbors , police and members of the communist militia went to planty street , home to the town 's jews . soon after , a police officer ordered the jews to hand over their weapons , and it was then that the first shots were fired .
no one can say with certainty who opened fire on whom , but the resulting battle with guns and clubs drew in soldiers , the police and civilians , who either shot the jews or beat them to death .
some were thrown out of the windows of apartment blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only about 250,000 polish jews out of 3.5 million survived the holocaust thirty-seven jews and three non-jewish poles were killed that day .
the incident was followed by other attacks on jews in the city several days later that killed up to 1,500 jews . and it prompted polish jews - once the largest jewish community in europe numbering 3.5 million before the nazis killed 90 percent of them - to flee in droves after surviving the holocaust : in the three months following the pogrom , around 70,000 jews left poland - more than the 50,000 who had emigrated during the entire year before . " after the kielce pogrom , the situation had inexorably changed , " historian bozena szaynok of wroclaw university told afp .
" right after the war , many jews emigrated to palestine , because they saw poland as a huge cemetery where they could no longer live .
after the pogrom , there was a real atmosphere of panic among jews .
they no longer felt that poland was safe for them . " ripe for violence even though there were other smaller pogroms in hungary and romania , the post-war atmosphere in poland was particularly ripe for the kielce pogrom , historians say . " the pogrom would never have happened if not for the climate of anti-semitism in poland at the time , where jews were dehumanized , seen as having been ' punished ' in the war , and the myth of the communist jew , who brought the hated communists to power , was freely spread , " historian andrzej paczkowski told afp . " poles feared that jews who survived the war would return and demand that the homes they abandoned when they fled the nazis be returned to them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new polish jewish museum is planned in 2008 for warsaw and even though the polish government apologized for the pogrom 10 years ago , many say that poles still largely see themselves as victims during and after the war and have failed to come to terms with anti-semitism , even today .

the whole country goes into mourning but dw-world.de believes germany still has plenty to celebrate even though the dream is now over . " we 're going to berlin " the euphoric fans were singing .
even those travelling to fan fests and bars all over germany were singing the refrain ; not a joyous exclamation of their actual destination but a song proclaiming the widely held belief that germany 's destiny was the world cup final in the capital on july 9 . they did get to berlin , on june 30 .
and they won there - beating argentina in a nail-biting , quarter-final climax - but they wo n't be going back to contest the world cup in the final .
germany 's dream of watching their home team raise the golden trophy in triumph ended when italy not only crashed the party but ate all the food , drank all the champagne and went home with the family silver stuffed up their shirts . for this was a smash-and-grab raid of the most heartless kind .
germany - not so much a country in the last few weeks , but a living , breathing unified entity - was ready to follows its team along its pre-destined path to the title and to then fall into a rapture which would quite possibly never end . that was the belief .
the country was riding a wave unlike anything felt in the last 15 years .
it was not only a hope that germany would win but it seemed to be a very poorly kept secret among the white-shirted millions which had turned a recently depressed and morose nation into the world 's biggest festival site .
no one doubted the outcome . klinsi 's kids came from nowhere to bring hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was supposed to be so different it was all very different before the world cup .
jürgen klinsmann 's team was already written-off before the first ball was kicked in anger .
but when the action started , this team of youngsters showed a desire and flair that no-one , not even the most enthusiastic fan , would have expected . but when the players started to deliver in such style , the country started to wonder .
and then they started to hope .
then they started to believe .
it was infectious and the team 's performances seemed to flow with an energy generated from hamburg to munich , from cologne to berlin . this is why the italian victory is such a blow to germany .
any team would be deflated by defeat , leaving the world stage to others who will compete for the trophy they thought they were destined to lift .
a country which wanted a world cup win on home soil so badly can only feel an emotion close to bereavement after such a loss . positive vibe must continue in host nation but while the bubble has so cruelly burst , there are huge positives to take from germany 's world cup experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans should be proud of their team and their world cup as a team , germany actually performed above all expectations and should be honoured and proud of their showing .
they should harness this new attacking flair , nurture it further and come back even stronger , possibly creating a new german legacy of soccer dominance in the future . as a people , the germans should refuse to let such a defeat rob them of their new enthusiasm and to channel the pride in their country and the new respect from outside their borders into a new positive way of living .
they have showed that germany can be an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the germans have consigned many of their stereotypes to a history pre-2006 through welcoming the world and showing it how to party . while the post-match trauma will no doubt lead to a river of tears which will flow through the country , germany must get a grip as soon as possible if this world cup is n't going to deflate entirely .
the germans now have a responsibility to put on their make-up once more , hold the flags proudly aloft again and continue to sing of travelling to berlin .

" now we 're on top form though , both mentally and physically , and there 's no way that something like that could ever happen again .

" the president will participate in the 2010 handover ceremony and launch the logo for the world cup that we are hosting , " pahad said at a media briefing .
" his visit comes in the context of south africa 's stated commitment to making the 2010 soccer world cup a truly african event , " he said . south africa on sunday are taking over the reigns from germany , having been two years ago awarded the hosting of the first ever world cup to come to the african continent . local officials this week reacted with outrage at a weekend newspaper report which stated fifa was working on a back-up plan to host the event in australia should south africa not be ready in time or fail to curb its perceived high levels of violent crime . world cup 2010 local organizing chief danny jordaan earlier this week described any suggestion to have the world cup moved off the continent as a " laughable notion " and " absolute nonsense .

the whole country goes into mourning but dw-world.de believes germany still has plenty to celebrate even though the dream is now over . " we 're going to berlin " the euphoric fans were singing .
even those travelling to fan fests and bars all over germany were singing the refrain ; not a joyous exclamation of their actual destination but a song proclaiming the widely held belief that germany 's destiny was the world cup final in the capital on july 9 . they did get to berlin , on june 30 .
and they won there - beating argentina in a nail-biting , quarter-final climax - but they wo n't be going back to contest the world cup in the final .
germany 's dream of watching their home team raise the golden trophy in triumph ended when italy not only crashed the party but ate all the food , drank all the champagne and went home with the family silver stuffed up their shirts . for this was a smash-and-grab raid of the most heartless kind .
germany - not so much a country in the last few weeks , but a living , breathing unified entity - was ready to follows its team along its pre-destined path to the title and to then fall into a rapture which would quite possibly never end . that was the belief .
the country was riding a wave unlike anything felt in the last 15 years .
it was not only a hope that germany would win but it seemed to be a very poorly kept secret among the white-shirted millions which had turned a recently depressed and morose nation into the world 's biggest festival site .
no one doubted the outcome . klinsi 's kids came from nowhere to bring hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was supposed to be so different it was all very different before the world cup .
jürgen klinsmann 's team was already written-off before the first ball was kicked in anger .
but when the action started , this team of youngsters showed a desire and flair that no-one , not even the most enthusiastic fan , would have expected . but when the players started to deliver in such style , the country started to wonder .
and then they started to hope .
then they started to believe .
it was infectious and the team 's performances seemed to flow with an energy generated from hamburg to munich , from cologne to berlin . this is why the italian victory is such a blow to germany .
any team would be deflated by defeat , leaving the world stage to others who will compete for the trophy they thought they were destined to lift .
a country which wanted a world cup win on home soil so badly can only feel an emotion close to bereavement after such a loss . positive vibe must continue in host nation but while the bubble has so cruelly burst , there are huge positives to take from germany 's world cup experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans should be proud of their team and their world cup as a team , germany actually performed above all expectations and should be honoured and proud of their showing .
they should harness this new attacking flair , nurture it further and come back even stronger , possibly creating a new german legacy of soccer dominance in the future . as a people , the germans should refuse to let such a defeat rob them of their new enthusiasm and to channel the pride in their country and the new respect from outside their borders into a new positive way of living .
they have showed that germany can be an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the germans have consigned many of their stereotypes to a history pre-2006 through welcoming the world and showing it how to party . while the post-match trauma will no doubt lead to a river of tears which will flow through the country , germany must get a grip as soon as possible if this world cup is n't going to deflate entirely .
the germans now have a responsibility to put on their make-up once more , hold the flags proudly aloft again and continue to sing of travelling to berlin .
because the final party is not going to be anywhere near as fun without the hosts in attendance . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hope win in germany eases scandal at home after an initial ambivalence concerning their team 's world cup chances , italians have come around to supporting the azzurri in their semi-final match against hosts germany .

the central council of jews in germany has called for the country 's nazi history to be taught as a separate subject .
but teachers ' representatives remain skeptical . charlotte knobloch , the president of the council , said students were taught far too little about the rule of adolf hitler and the holocaust , particularly in the former communist east germany , the online netzeitung reported .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de features -pipe- 04.07.2006 the world cup is over for germany but the party must continue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's world cup dream died in the last two minutes of extra-time despite the prayers hosts germany are out of the world cup after losing to italy .
the whole country goes into mourning but dw-world.de believes germany still has plenty to celebrate even though the dream is now over . " we 're going to berlin " the euphoric fans were singing .
even those travelling to fan fests and bars all over germany were singing the refrain ; not a joyous exclamation of their actual destination but a song proclaiming the widely held belief that germany 's destiny was the world cup final in the capital on july 9 . they did get to berlin , on june 30 .
and they won there - beating argentina in a nail-biting , quarter-final climax - but they wo n't be going back to contest the world cup in the final .
germany 's dream of watching their home team raise the golden trophy in triumph ended when italy not only crashed the party but ate all the food , drank all the champagne and went home with the family silver stuffed up their shirts . for this was a smash-and-grab raid of the most heartless kind .
germany - not so much a country in the last few weeks , but a living , breathing unified entity - was ready to follows its team along its pre-destined path to the title and to then fall into a rapture which would quite possibly never end . that was the belief .
the country was riding a wave unlike anything felt in the last 15 years .
it was not only a hope that germany would win but it seemed to be a very poorly kept secret among the white-shirted millions which had turned a recently depressed and morose nation into the world 's biggest festival site .
no one doubted the outcome . klinsi 's kids came from nowhere to bring hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was supposed to be so different it was all very different before the world cup .
jürgen klinsmann 's team was already written-off before the first ball was kicked in anger .
but when the action started , this team of youngsters showed a desire and flair that no-one , not even the most enthusiastic fan , would have expected . but when the players started to deliver in such style , the country started to wonder .
and then they started to hope .
then they started to believe .
it was infectious and the team 's performances seemed to flow with an energy generated from hamburg to munich , from cologne to berlin . this is why the italian victory is such a blow to germany .
any team would be deflated by defeat , leaving the world stage to others who will compete for the trophy they thought they were destined to lift .
a country which wanted a world cup win on home soil so badly can only feel an emotion close to bereavement after such a loss . positive vibe must continue in host nation but while the bubble has so cruelly burst , there are huge positives to take from germany 's world cup experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans should be proud of their team and their world cup as a team , germany actually performed above all expectations and should be honoured and proud of their showing .
they should harness this new attacking flair , nurture it further and come back even stronger , possibly creating a new german legacy of soccer dominance in the future . as a people , the germans should refuse to let such a defeat rob them of their new enthusiasm and to channel the pride in their country and the new respect from outside their borders into a new positive way of living .
they have showed that germany can be an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the germans have consigned many of their stereotypes to a history pre-2006 through welcoming the world and showing it how to party . while the post-match trauma will no doubt lead to a river of tears which will flow through the country , germany must get a grip as soon as possible if this world cup is n't going to deflate entirely .
the germans now have a responsibility to put on their make-up once more , hold the flags proudly aloft again and continue to sing of travelling to berlin .
because the final party is not going to be anywhere near as fun without the hosts in attendance . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hope win in germany eases scandal at home after an initial ambivalence concerning their team 's world cup chances , italians have come around to supporting the azzurri in their semi-final match against hosts germany .

the whole country goes into mourning but dw-world.de believes germany still has plenty to celebrate even though the dream is now over . " we 're going to berlin " the euphoric fans were singing .
even those travelling to fan fests and bars all over germany were singing the refrain ; not a joyous exclamation of their actual destination but a song proclaiming the widely held belief that germany 's destiny was the world cup final in the capital on july 9 . they did get to berlin , on june 30 .
and they won there - beating argentina in a nail-biting , quarter-final climax - but they wo n't be going back to contest the world cup in the final .
germany 's dream of watching their home team raise the golden trophy in triumph ended when italy not only crashed the party but ate all the food , drank all the champagne and went home with the family silver stuffed up their shirts . for this was a smash-and-grab raid of the most heartless kind .
germany - not so much a country in the last few weeks , but a living , breathing unified entity - was ready to follows its team along its pre-destined path to the title and to then fall into a rapture which would quite possibly never end . that was the belief .
the country was riding a wave unlike anything felt in the last 15 years .
it was not only a hope that germany would win but it seemed to be a very poorly kept secret among the white-shirted millions which had turned a recently depressed and morose nation into the world 's biggest festival site .
no one doubted the outcome . klinsi 's kids came from nowhere to bring hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was supposed to be so different it was all very different before the world cup .
jürgen klinsmann 's team was already written-off before the first ball was kicked in anger .
but when the action started , this team of youngsters showed a desire and flair that no-one , not even the most enthusiastic fan , would have expected . but when the players started to deliver in such style , the country started to wonder .
and then they started to hope .
then they started to believe .
it was infectious and the team 's performances seemed to flow with an energy generated from hamburg to munich , from cologne to berlin . this is why the italian victory is such a blow to germany .
any team would be deflated by defeat , leaving the world stage to others who will compete for the trophy they thought they were destined to lift .
a country which wanted a world cup win on home soil so badly can only feel an emotion close to bereavement after such a loss . positive vibe must continue in host nation but while the bubble has so cruelly burst , there are huge positives to take from germany 's world cup experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans should be proud of their team and their world cup as a team , germany actually performed above all expectations and should be honoured and proud of their showing .
they should harness this new attacking flair , nurture it further and come back even stronger , possibly creating a new german legacy of soccer dominance in the future . as a people , the germans should refuse to let such a defeat rob them of their new enthusiasm and to channel the pride in their country and the new respect from outside their borders into a new positive way of living .
they have showed that germany can be an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the germans have consigned many of their stereotypes to a history pre-2006 through welcoming the world and showing it how to party . while the post-match trauma will no doubt lead to a river of tears which will flow through the country , germany must get a grip as soon as possible if this world cup is n't going to deflate entirely .
the germans now have a responsibility to put on their make-up once more , hold the flags proudly aloft again and continue to sing of travelling to berlin .
because the final party is not going to be anywhere near as fun without the hosts in attendance . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hope win in germany eases scandal at home after an initial ambivalence concerning their team 's world cup chances , italians have come around to supporting the azzurri in their semi-final match against hosts germany .

the central council of jews in germany has called for the country 's nazi history to be taught as a separate subject .
but teachers ' representatives remain skeptical . charlotte knobloch , the president of the council , said students were taught far too little about the rule of adolf hitler and the holocaust , particularly in the former communist east germany , the online netzeitung reported . " we urgently need to overhaul the way history is taught because far too little attention is paid to national socialism , " knobloch said , adding that the solution would be to devote a course to this chapter of history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch wants to overhaul teaching about the holocaust " it should be made legally binding to do so throughout all of germany 's states , " she added . knobloch , a 73-year-old holocaust survivor , said there were teachers in the former german democratic republic who " hardly know anything about history " .
she added that the system of training school teachers in germany had to be overhauled towards that purpose . teachers dismissive of proposal but knobloch 's comments have met with indignation and skepticism from teachers ' unions as well as the council of regional educational ministries . ute erdsiek , president of the council and education minister of the state of schleswig-holstein told news agency ap that the nazi era and the holocaust were a " mandatory , integral and exhaustive " part of history lessons in all forms of schools in germany .
nazism is also a permanent chapter of the teachers ' training program both in western germany as well as the former communist east germany , erdsiek added . the german teachers ' union described knobloch 's proposals as " wrong and not justified . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students near the holocaust memorial in berlin union president josef kraus said teachers were dedicated to teaching the period between 1933 and 1945 " with the necessary time frame and with necessary discernment . "
" no other era of german history is studied as intensively in german schools as national socialism , " kraus said . new dialogue with jews ? however , erdsiek added that in the face of new political challenges such as the rise of right-wing extremism and increasing multiculturalism in society , the council of regional educational ministries was readily prepared to open a dialogue with the central council of jews about a contemporary and didactic revamping of history lessons about the holocaust . the central council of jews in germany is the highest body representing the country 's 110,000 jews .

" everything we have that has wheels on it will be rolling on july 4 , " said hubert jung , head of dortmund 's local transportation authority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's nothing quite like cracking open a can of stadium air !

" school children also want to see the game , " he said , adding that a penalty shoot-out , such as the one germany needed to beat argentina , could keep kids up long past their bedtime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one last look , then i 'm headed to watch the game soccer mania surpasses car craze some german car companies have also come to terms with the fact that , even in a country as automobile crazy as germany , repair rates for cars made after tuesday 's 9:00 p.m. kick-off could skyrocket as employees ' ability to concentrate on the job plummets when die mannschaft take on the azzurri in dortmund . daimlerchrysler decided to cut one shift from the production schedule in sindelfingen so some 10,000 workers can watch the game .
porsche and bmw are also fiddling with their shifts times to allow staff to clock out in time to catch the game . many deutsche bahn employees , however , will be stuck listening to the radio as the rail company puts about 100 more trains on the tracks to help soccer fans get where they are going , and dortmund airport has registered 107 extra flights with more than 1,500 passengers , many of which are coming from italy , according to airport and border control officials . " everything we have that has wheels on it will be rolling on july 4 , " said hubert jung , head of dortmund 's local transportation authority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's nothing quite like cracking open a can of stadium air !
a breath of sweaty , beery arena air even with the extra transportation , not everyone is going to make it to the city , but a bochum-based company wants to make sure soccer fans still get a whiff of the action . stadionluft has filled 25,000 cans with " original stadium air " from the dortmund grounds and put them on sale for 4.95 euros -lrb- $ 6.34 -rrb- per can for the people who are stuck without a ticket but still want to experience the scent that can comes from a fresh pitch mixed with beer and sausages . regardless of where people watch , the german red cross has three tips for fans watching the games outside : put on sunscreen ; choose sturdy footwear over flip flops ; and drink lots of water instead of alcohol . at least two out of three should n't prove too difficult . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de offsides from the fringe soccer : it 's a funny ol ' game .

" we 're already highly focused , " germany team manager oliver bierhoff said .
" we 're really looking forward to playing in dortmund .
that 'll really be an advantage for us , since the atmosphere should be unbelievable . " germany have never lost in dortmund , winning 13 of their 14 internationals played there . but italy can take heart from their excellent record against germany in the world cup with two wins and two draws in four meetings , including epic victories in the 1970 semi-final and the 1982 final . francesco totti , whose performance in the 3-0 quarter-final win over ukraine was his best of the tournament so far , wants italy to emulate the great azzurri teams of the past by adding another famous victory against their old foes . dortmund crowd a boost for germans , challenge for italians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans have great memories of the 1-0 win against poland in dortmund " on tuesday we want to write another chapter in the duel , " said the roma captain .
" to beat germany in their own country in front of a hostile crowd , well it could n't get any better than that . " despite some unconvincing performances on their way to the semis , italy boast a 23-match unbeaten run - their best streak since 1939 - and defender fabio grosso believes they can break german hearts at the westfalenstadion . " we 're taking on a great team that has the backing of the whole country , but we believe in ourselves , " grosso said .
" we need to play like we know how and put them in difficulty . " friendly defeat belongs in history books bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans are convinced they wo n't be leaving the field with the heads against italy again italy showed the germans just how difficult they can be with a humiliating 4-1 drubbing in a friendly four months ago , leading much of the german press to call for coach jürgen klinsmann 's head .
but italian trainer marcello lippi insisted that result will have no bearing on tuesday 's clash . " we wo n't score four goals against germany again , " lippi said .
" they 're not the same side we met in march .
now they are exploiting the enthusiasm of the whole nation and it has transformed them . " bierhoff added that 4-1 loss was " no longer a reference point " for the german team . " the defeat really scarred us , and we played absolutely awfully , " he said .
" now we 're on top form though , both mentally and physically , and there 's no way that something like that could ever happen again . " klinsmann , who stated winning the tournament on home soil is his only goal , added that his side is capable of beating the azzurri . " italy are one of the best teams in the world , and that is why they are in the final four , " said klinsmann .
" but we think if we play our own game we can beat them .
i believe the confidence that we have built over the last six weeks is enough to win the next two games and become world champions . " crucial players missing on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings was suspended for having a role in a post-match brawl italy defender alessandro nesta is almost certain to miss his third straight match due to a groin strain , while germany will be without midfielder torsten frings , who was suspended for the semi-final by fifa , world soccer 's governing body , for his role in a scuffle following germany 's match against argentina . the hosts will be able to keep captain michael ballack on the roster .
a question mark remained next to his name after serious cramps during the team 's quarter-final . fifa statistics show the germans are the most offensively minded of the teams in the 2006 tournament with 88 shots on goal , while the italians have proved to be nearly unbeatable in their own penalty area by giving up just one goal - an own goal . the winner of tuesday 's game will go on to face either portugal or france in the final in berlin on july 9 .

long known for its rigid shopping laws that force stores to close at certain times and on sundays , germany is rethinking consumerism and may abolish the rules . it 's a long tradition in germany : get up early and run to the store on saturday morning to shop for the week , because you might as well forget about picking up anything on sunday . but over the past few years , shops in large german cities have begun staying open longer on weekdays and saturdays to meet consumer demand .
some crafty stores have even skirted the sunday shopping ban by claiming tourists as shoppers as these shops are allowed an exemption . but now , germany 's parliament , busy with federal reform , has decided to repeal a 1956 " store closing law " and make it easier for consumers to spend their money when they please . " germany has a too complicated and protracted decision-making process , " chancellor angela merkel told parliament last week . regional decisions the repeal of the ladenschlussgesetz -lrb- store closing law -rrb- is part of a series of 25 measures to reform the federal system to give the 16 states more power in matters of health , education , wages and prisons .
in exchange for the devolution , the federal government 's power is enhanced by cutting in half the number of laws that must be approved by state legislatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some stores such as ones in train stations are already allowed to stay open on sundays as a result , the states will be able to set their own shopping hours .
currently , stores are required to close by 8 p.m. and stay closed on sundays .
that is later than allowed until 1996 , when shops were required to close by 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and 1 p.m. on saturdays . trade unions have protested the proposed changes the law , saying it helps provide families time together and protects small businesses , which could be pushed out of the market by larger corporations that force their employees to work longer hours . despite the pushing for the reform , government officials said they hope the states do n't change current hours . " it would be good if the states do not approve more than four sundays a year that stores can stay open , " said merkel . changes ahead the reform package will be voted on july 7 by germany 's upper house of parliament .
if approved as expected , the measures will take effect in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup has led some shops to stay open on sundays but no one is coming in berlin , as well as a number of other states , officials said they plan to keep the sunday shopping ban on all but a few sundays each year but will leave other times up to store owners . still , even now in most large german cities such as berlin , munich and hamburg , it is possible to buy goods on sundays at gas stations , train station shops or in certain stores in tourist zones .
the immigrant communities , such as the turks , also often do business on sunday . meanwhile , during the world cup , many stores , such as swedish furniture giant ikea , have taken advantage of a temporary suspension of the shopping rules and have extended their store hours to remain open on sundays . however , a quick look at these stores is telling , as only a few customers can be seen strolling through the aisles as most people are out enjoying the unusually beautiful weather or watching matches dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shops to stay open longer for world cup while german soccer fans hope the home team will rack up the goals , businesses are counting on longer opening hours to fill their cash registers with euros , but not everyone is convinced it will work .

long known for its rigid shopping laws that force stores to close at certain times and on sundays , germany is rethinking consumerism and may abolish the rules . it 's a long tradition in germany : get up early and run to the store on saturday morning to shop for the week , because you might as well forget about picking up anything on sunday . but over the past few years , shops in large german cities have begun staying open longer on weekdays and saturdays to meet consumer demand .
some crafty stores have even skirted the sunday shopping ban by claiming tourists as shoppers as these shops are allowed an exemption . but now , germany 's parliament , busy with federal reform , has decided to repeal a 1956 " store closing law " and make it easier for consumers to spend their money when they please . " germany has a too complicated and protracted decision-making process , " chancellor angela merkel told parliament last week . regional decisions the repeal of the ladenschlussgesetz -lrb- store closing law -rrb- is part of a series of 25 measures to reform the federal system to give the 16 states more power in matters of health , education , wages and prisons .
in exchange for the devolution , the federal government 's power is enhanced by cutting in half the number of laws that must be approved by state legislatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some stores such as ones in train stations are already allowed to stay open on sundays as a result , the states will be able to set their own shopping hours .

that is later than allowed until 1996 , when shops were required to close by 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and 1 p.m. on saturdays . trade unions have protested the proposed changes the law , saying it helps provide families time together and protects small businesses , which could be pushed out of the market by larger corporations that force their employees to work longer hours . despite the pushing for the reform , government officials said they hope the states do n't change current hours . " it would be good if the states do not approve more than four sundays a year that stores can stay open , " said merkel . changes ahead the reform package will be voted on july 7 by germany 's upper house of parliament .
if approved as expected , the measures will take effect in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup has led some shops to stay open on sundays but no one is coming in berlin , as well as a number of other states , officials said they plan to keep the sunday shopping ban on all but a few sundays each year but will leave other times up to store owners . still , even now in most large german cities such as berlin , munich and hamburg , it is possible to buy goods on sundays at gas stations , train station shops or in certain stores in tourist zones .
the immigrant communities , such as the turks , also often do business on sunday . meanwhile , during the world cup , many stores , such as swedish furniture giant ikea , have taken advantage of a temporary suspension of the shopping rules and have extended their store hours to remain open on sundays . however , a quick look at these stores is telling , as only a few customers can be seen strolling through the aisles as most people are out enjoying the unusually beautiful weather or watching matches dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shops to stay open longer for world cup while german soccer fans hope the home team will rack up the goals , businesses are counting on longer opening hours to fill their cash registers with euros , but not everyone is convinced it will work .

german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- has come under fire over a new health reform deal proposed on monday . according to the deal which was hammered out after late-night talks sunday , healthcare contributions paid by employees and their employers will increase from the beginning of next year by around half a percentage point to help close a massive funding gap . in addition , around 1.5 billion in tax revenue will go toward health insurance for children in 2008 and double that amount in 2009 . " this is an important breakthrough we have succeeded in making , " merkel said monday after the late-night huddle . however , a day later finance minister peer steinbrück said the financing plans for children 's healthcare were not yet fixed .
in tuesday 's edition of the handelsblatt daily , steinbrück said " we have not yet agreed to the finance format . " merkel 's health reform thwarts the plan by the spd coalition partners , who had sought an increase in tax to meet the funding shortfall .
merkel rejected the tax hike partly because the electorate already faces a rise in sales tax next year . spd critical of health reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat leader , kurt beck on tuesday , the leader of the spd , kurt beck , told the daily mainzer allgemeinen zeitung he had hoped to be able to lower contributions but that " one has to make compromises in a coalition . "
in the end , " patients would be the winners " of the deal , he said . the reforms drew the ire of guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , the biggest opposition group .
westerwelle said the proposals reminded him of a planned economy and had " nothing to do with free competition . "
westerwelle accused the coalition government of using the distraction around the football world cup to " cash up . " industry says health reforms stifle employment big business has argued that the reforms will make it even more expensive to hire new employees .
statutory healthcare costs are currently 14 percent of an employee 's wage , split between worker and employer . the president of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , ludwig georg braun told the daily neuen osnabrücker zeitung on tuesday that the increase in non-wage labor costs means that firms wo n't be able afford to expand their workforce .
he called for set health care contributions independent of wages . the head of the panel of six economic advisors to the government , bert rürup , called the reform a " rather modest compromise based on the lowest common denominator . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics says germany 's health care system is too bureaucratic germany 's 123-year-old public health system is widely criticized for its bloated bureaucracy and lack of transparency . according the organization for economic co-operation and development , germany spends close to 11 percent of its gross domestic product on healthcare , more than france , austria , the netherlands , italy , britain and spain . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government agrees on health , corporate tax reform germany 's ruling coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- said after all-night talks that it had agreed on parts of key reforms to healthcare and corporate taxation .
-lrb- july 3 , 2006 -rrb- german health system not quite in intensive care going by media reports and public opinion in germany , one might think the country 's health care system is sclerotic and near collapse .
but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- vat increase puts germany closer to eu average the 3 percent value-added tax increase that was part of chancellor angela merkel 's election campaign did n't come as a surprise to anyone in germany , but that does n't mean everyone is willing to accept it .

over 90 percent of visitors said it really is " a time to make friends . " millions of fans descended on germany during the opening stages of the world cup , and while some have already followed their teams home and others look for last-minute bargains on airfare to berlin , a study published monday showed nearly all of them enjoyed their time in the country . " germany has created an excellent atmosphere and image of itself , " said alfons madeja , a sports scientist , while presenting the study .
" the world cup has also contributed to a new , natural and healthy german sense of self-confidence . " just over 93 percent of the 5,000 soccer fans from around the world who took part in the study gave the host country an overall grade of good to very good , madeja told the german dpa news agency . eating , drinking and partying win out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are one of you in the wrong section ?
friendship and the bare necessities proved to be what most fans were looking to get out of their trip to germany .
at 88.7 percent , meeting people from other countries was nearly as important as the triumvirate of " eating , drinking and partying , " according to the study . the venues ' elaborate cultural programs , on the other hand , did n't fare as well .
music concerts were the most popular part of the non-soccer program , catching the interest of 43.1 percent of foreign visitors . " art and culture are , however , an important factor in repeat visits , " according to a study of the 2004 european championships . only 4 percent of the respondents came to germany alone while 64 percent came in with friends . " there were a lot of men coming in clubs who had previously traveled to several world and european cups in the past , " madeja said , adding that the rest of the visitors came with family members . changing the image of germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are n't used to taking shelter under the flag the stereotypical view of germans as orderly and reserved also changed in a number of minds , according to madeja . " we showed emotion and finally were not afraid to be happy , express our pride and joy and show our national colors , " he added . but germans still held on to their image as organized and efficient while presenting the country as a safe place to visit with a short supply of good cooks . safety , ease of transportation and organization all ranked well in the survey , while the quality of food left about one of four people looking for something else to eat . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer 's gain is the entertainment and travel industry 's loss the world cup has made homebodies of film buffs and theatergoers , who stay glued to the tube instead of going out .
result : a temporary dip in the german entertainment sector .
-lrb- june 29 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : germany finally gets an image makeover the full significance of germany holding the world cup has just started to register .
in its typically understated manner , the country is winning over its critics - just by being itself .
-lrb- june 30 , 2006 -rrb- world cup exceptions to the teutonic rules surrounded by the euphoria of seeing the national team move into the semi-finals , germans are going to unusual lengths to make sure they enjoy the game and - hopefully - post-match celebrations .

long known for its rigid shopping laws that force stores to close at certain times and on sundays , germany is rethinking consumerism and may abolish the rules . it 's a long tradition in germany : get up early and run to the store on saturday morning to shop for the week , because you might as well forget about picking up anything on sunday . but over the past few years , shops in large german cities have begun staying open longer on weekdays and saturdays to meet consumer demand .
some crafty stores have even skirted the sunday shopping ban by claiming tourists as shoppers as these shops are allowed an exemption . but now , germany 's parliament , busy with federal reform , has decided to repeal a 1956 " store closing law " and make it easier for consumers to spend their money when they please . " germany has a too complicated and protracted decision-making process , " chancellor angela merkel told parliament last week . regional decisions the repeal of the ladenschlussgesetz -lrb- store closing law -rrb- is part of a series of 25 measures to reform the federal system to give the 16 states more power in matters of health , education , wages and prisons .
in exchange for the devolution , the federal government 's power is enhanced by cutting in half the number of laws that must be approved by state legislatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some stores such as ones in train stations are already allowed to stay open on sundays as a result , the states will be able to set their own shopping hours .
currently , stores are required to close by 8 p.m. and stay closed on sundays .
that is later than allowed until 1996 , when shops were required to close by 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and 1 p.m. on saturdays . trade unions have protested the proposed changes the law , saying it helps provide families time together and protects small businesses , which could be pushed out of the market by larger corporations that force their employees to work longer hours . despite the pushing for the reform , government officials said they hope the states do n't change current hours . " it would be good if the states do not approve more than four sundays a year that stores can stay open , " said merkel . changes ahead the reform package will be voted on july 7 by germany 's upper house of parliament .
if approved as expected , the measures will take effect in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup has led some shops to stay open on sundays but no one is coming in berlin , as well as a number of other states , officials said they plan to keep the sunday shopping ban on all but a few sundays each year but will leave other times up to store owners . still , even now in most large german cities such as berlin , munich and hamburg , it is possible to buy goods on sundays at gas stations , train station shops or in certain stores in tourist zones .
the immigrant communities , such as the turks , also often do business on sunday . meanwhile , during the world cup , many stores , such as swedish furniture giant ikea , have taken advantage of a temporary suspension of the shopping rules and have extended their store hours to remain open on sundays . however , a quick look at these stores is telling , as only a few customers can be seen strolling through the aisles as most people are out enjoying the unusually beautiful weather or watching matches dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shops to stay open longer for world cup while german soccer fans hope the home team will rack up the goals , businesses are counting on longer opening hours to fill their cash registers with euros , but not everyone is convinced it will work .

the whole country goes into mourning but dw-world.de believes germany still has plenty to celebrate even though the dream is now over . " we 're going to berlin " the euphoric fans were singing .
even those travelling to fan fests and bars all over germany were singing the refrain ; not a joyous exclamation of their actual destination but a song proclaiming the widely held belief that germany 's destiny was the world cup final in the capital on july 9 . they did get to berlin , on june 30 .
and they won there - beating argentina in a nail-biting , quarter-final climax - but they wo n't be going back to contest the world cup in the final .
germany 's dream of watching their home team raise the golden trophy in triumph ended when italy not only crashed the party but ate all the food , drank all the champagne and went home with the family silver stuffed up their shirts . for this was a smash-and-grab raid of the most heartless kind .
germany - not so much a country in the last few weeks , but a living , breathing unified entity - was ready to follows its team along its pre-destined path to the title and to then fall into a rapture which would quite possibly never end . that was the belief .
the country was riding a wave unlike anything felt in the last 15 years .
it was not only a hope that germany would win but it seemed to be a very poorly kept secret among the white-shirted millions which had turned a recently depressed and morose nation into the world 's biggest festival site .
no one doubted the outcome . klinsi 's kids came from nowhere to bring hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was supposed to be so different it was all very different before the world cup .
jürgen klinsmann 's team was already written-off before the first ball was kicked in anger .
but when the action started , this team of youngsters showed a desire and flair that no-one , not even the most enthusiastic fan , would have expected . but when the players started to deliver in such style , the country started to wonder .
and then they started to hope .
then they started to believe .
it was infectious and the team 's performances seemed to flow with an energy generated from hamburg to munich , from cologne to berlin . this is why the italian victory is such a blow to germany .
any team would be deflated by defeat , leaving the world stage to others who will compete for the trophy they thought they were destined to lift .
a country which wanted a world cup win on home soil so badly can only feel an emotion close to bereavement after such a loss . positive vibe must continue in host nation but while the bubble has so cruelly burst , there are huge positives to take from germany 's world cup experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans should be proud of their team and their world cup as a team , germany actually performed above all expectations and should be honoured and proud of their showing .
they should harness this new attacking flair , nurture it further and come back even stronger , possibly creating a new german legacy of soccer dominance in the future . as a people , the germans should refuse to let such a defeat rob them of their new enthusiasm and to channel the pride in their country and the new respect from outside their borders into a new positive way of living .
they have showed that germany can be an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the germans have consigned many of their stereotypes to a history pre-2006 through welcoming the world and showing it how to party . while the post-match trauma will no doubt lead to a river of tears which will flow through the country , germany must get a grip as soon as possible if this world cup is n't going to deflate entirely .

germany 's dream of watching their home team raise the golden trophy in triumph ended when italy not only crashed the party but ate all the food , drank all the champagne and went home with the family silver stuffed up their shirts . for this was a smash-and-grab raid of the most heartless kind .

it killed about 40 jews in kielce and led to an exodus of polish jews who survived the holocaust . first came the rumors ; then came the violence .
in the end , 42 people , all but three jewish , were murdered in the polish town of kielce , in what is known as europe 's last pogrom , one year after the surrender of the nazis . for decades , this event in poland 's past lay unexamined by many poles themselves .
but now that is changing as the eu member prepares to unveil a new monument and hold ceremonies marking the day that set off an exodus of jews into exile . " each and every country has its history , " piotr kadlczik , chairman of the union of jewish communities , told polish radio .
" and in this history , it has moments of which it can be proud or ashamed .
to make a selection by thinking only about the proud moments makes this history poorer . "
one violent night on july 4 , 1946 , a rumor began to circulate that a jewish family had kidnapped a christian child and held him in a cellar overnight .
the rumor soon grew and , as rumors do , took on incredible dimensions .
word had it that the small jewish community of kielce needed to have blood transfusions from christians to exist , to make matzos , jewish unleavened bread ; skulls and skeletons were in the cellar of jewish families , due to ritual killings . the father of the missing boy - who was actually sleeping at a friend 's house - asked police to investigate .
the father , neighbors , police and members of the communist militia went to planty street , home to the town 's jews . soon after , a police officer ordered the jews to hand over their weapons , and it was then that the first shots were fired .
no one can say with certainty who opened fire on whom , but the resulting battle with guns and clubs drew in soldiers , the police and civilians , who either shot the jews or beat them to death .
some were thrown out of the windows of apartment blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only about 250,000 polish jews out of 3.5 million survived the holocaust thirty-seven jews and three non-jewish poles were killed that day .
the incident was followed by other attacks on jews in the city several days later that killed up to 1,500 jews . and it prompted polish jews - once the largest jewish community in europe numbering 3.5 million before the nazis killed 90 percent of them - to flee in droves after surviving the holocaust : in the three months following the pogrom , around 70,000 jews left poland - more than the 50,000 who had emigrated during the entire year before . " after the kielce pogrom , the situation had inexorably changed , " historian bozena szaynok of wroclaw university told afp .
" right after the war , many jews emigrated to palestine , because they saw poland as a huge cemetery where they could no longer live .
after the pogrom , there was a real atmosphere of panic among jews .
they no longer felt that poland was safe for them . " ripe for violence even though there were other smaller pogroms in hungary and romania , the post-war atmosphere in poland was particularly ripe for the kielce pogrom , historians say . " the pogrom would never have happened if not for the climate of anti-semitism in poland at the time , where jews were dehumanized , seen as having been ' punished ' in the war , and the myth of the communist jew , who brought the hated communists to power , was freely spread , " historian andrzej paczkowski told afp . " poles feared that jews who survived the war would return and demand that the homes they abandoned when they fled the nazis be returned to them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new polish jewish museum is planned in 2008 for warsaw and even though the polish government apologized for the pogrom 10 years ago , many say that poles still largely see themselves as victims during and after the war and have failed to come to terms with anti-semitism , even today . " the tragic death of polish jews is something that has never been properly mourned here , " jan t. gross , a polish-american author of books on poles and jews told the associated press .
" and the absence of mourning is something that has to be remedied because it weighs on the collective consciousness of the society . " his latest book , " fear , " is largely about the kielce pogrom and post-war anti-semitism in poland . modern anti-semitism more recently , the recent entry of the far-right league of polish families party - which has its origins in a pre-war anti-semitic party - into the conservative coalition government has raised concerns about anti-semitism in poland .
even pope benedict has warned the far right and its religious radio station , radio maryja , about its questionable comments regarding jews . and in may , poland 's chief rabbi michael schudrich was attacked in warsaw by a pole who allegedly has ties to neo-nazi groups . " there is anti-semitism in poland today , " he told the bbc .
" it , however , still does not play a significant role in society , in large measure thanks to the teachings of john paul ii .
the level of anti-semitism here is actually far less than in almost any other european country today . " after sirens wailed at 4 p.m.

it killed about 40 jews in kielce and led to an exodus of polish jews who survived the holocaust . first came the rumors ; then came the violence .
in the end , 42 people , all but three jewish , were murdered in the polish town of kielce , in what is known as europe 's last pogrom , one year after the surrender of the nazis . for decades , this event in poland 's past lay unexamined by many poles themselves .
but now that is changing as the eu member prepares to unveil a new monument and hold ceremonies marking the day that set off an exodus of jews into exile . " each and every country has its history , " piotr kadlczik , chairman of the union of jewish communities , told polish radio .
" and in this history , it has moments of which it can be proud or ashamed .
to make a selection by thinking only about the proud moments makes this history poorer . "
one violent night on july 4 , 1946 , a rumor began to circulate that a jewish family had kidnapped a christian child and held him in a cellar overnight .
the rumor soon grew and , as rumors do , took on incredible dimensions .
word had it that the small jewish community of kielce needed to have blood transfusions from christians to exist , to make matzos , jewish unleavened bread ; skulls and skeletons were in the cellar of jewish families , due to ritual killings . the father of the missing boy - who was actually sleeping at a friend 's house - asked police to investigate .
the father , neighbors , police and members of the communist militia went to planty street , home to the town 's jews . soon after , a police officer ordered the jews to hand over their weapons , and it was then that the first shots were fired .
no one can say with certainty who opened fire on whom , but the resulting battle with guns and clubs drew in soldiers , the police and civilians , who either shot the jews or beat them to death .
some were thrown out of the windows of apartment blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only about 250,000 polish jews out of 3.5 million survived the holocaust thirty-seven jews and three non-jewish poles were killed that day .
the incident was followed by other attacks on jews in the city several days later that killed up to 1,500 jews . and it prompted polish jews - once the largest jewish community in europe numbering 3.5 million before the nazis killed 90 percent of them - to flee in droves after surviving the holocaust : in the three months following the pogrom , around 70,000 jews left poland - more than the 50,000 who had emigrated during the entire year before . " after the kielce pogrom , the situation had inexorably changed , " historian bozena szaynok of wroclaw university told afp .
" right after the war , many jews emigrated to palestine , because they saw poland as a huge cemetery where they could no longer live .
after the pogrom , there was a real atmosphere of panic among jews .
they no longer felt that poland was safe for them . " ripe for violence even though there were other smaller pogroms in hungary and romania , the post-war atmosphere in poland was particularly ripe for the kielce pogrom , historians say . " the pogrom would never have happened if not for the climate of anti-semitism in poland at the time , where jews were dehumanized , seen as having been ' punished ' in the war , and the myth of the communist jew , who brought the hated communists to power , was freely spread , " historian andrzej paczkowski told afp . " poles feared that jews who survived the war would return and demand that the homes they abandoned when they fled the nazis be returned to them . "

" the tragic death of polish jews is something that has never been properly mourned here , " jan t. gross , a polish-american author of books on poles and jews told the associated press .
" and the absence of mourning is something that has to be remedied because it weighs on the collective consciousness of the society .

long known for its rigid shopping laws that force stores to close at certain times and on sundays , germany is rethinking consumerism and may abolish the rules . it 's a long tradition in germany : get up early and run to the store on saturday morning to shop for the week , because you might as well forget about picking up anything on sunday . but over the past few years , shops in large german cities have begun staying open longer on weekdays and saturdays to meet consumer demand .
some crafty stores have even skirted the sunday shopping ban by claiming tourists as shoppers as these shops are allowed an exemption . but now , germany 's parliament , busy with federal reform , has decided to repeal a 1956 " store closing law " and make it easier for consumers to spend their money when they please . " germany has a too complicated and protracted decision-making process , " chancellor angela merkel told parliament last week . regional decisions the repeal of the ladenschlussgesetz -lrb- store closing law -rrb- is part of a series of 25 measures to reform the federal system to give the 16 states more power in matters of health , education , wages and prisons .
in exchange for the devolution , the federal government 's power is enhanced by cutting in half the number of laws that must be approved by state legislatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some stores such as ones in train stations are already allowed to stay open on sundays as a result , the states will be able to set their own shopping hours .
currently , stores are required to close by 8 p.m. and stay closed on sundays .
that is later than allowed until 1996 , when shops were required to close by 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and 1 p.m. on saturdays . trade unions have protested the proposed changes the law , saying it helps provide families time together and protects small businesses , which could be pushed out of the market by larger corporations that force their employees to work longer hours . despite the pushing for the reform , government officials said they hope the states do n't change current hours . " it would be good if the states do not approve more than four sundays a year that stores can stay open , " said merkel . changes ahead the reform package will be voted on july 7 by germany 's upper house of parliament .
if approved as expected , the measures will take effect in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup has led some shops to stay open on sundays but no one is coming in berlin , as well as a number of other states , officials said they plan to keep the sunday shopping ban on all but a few sundays each year but will leave other times up to store owners . still , even now in most large german cities such as berlin , munich and hamburg , it is possible to buy goods on sundays at gas stations , train station shops or in certain stores in tourist zones .
the immigrant communities , such as the turks , also often do business on sunday . meanwhile , during the world cup , many stores , such as swedish furniture giant ikea , have taken advantage of a temporary suspension of the shopping rules and have extended their store hours to remain open on sundays . however , a quick look at these stores is telling , as only a few customers can be seen strolling through the aisles as most people are out enjoying the unusually beautiful weather or watching matches dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shops to stay open longer for world cup while german soccer fans hope the home team will rack up the goals , businesses are counting on longer opening hours to fill their cash registers with euros , but not everyone is convinced it will work .

long known for its rigid shopping laws that force stores to close at certain times and on sundays , germany is rethinking consumerism and may abolish the rules . it 's a long tradition in germany : get up early and run to the store on saturday morning to shop for the week , because you might as well forget about picking up anything on sunday . but over the past few years , shops in large german cities have begun staying open longer on weekdays and saturdays to meet consumer demand .
some crafty stores have even skirted the sunday shopping ban by claiming tourists as shoppers as these shops are allowed an exemption . but now , germany 's parliament , busy with federal reform , has decided to repeal a 1956 " store closing law " and make it easier for consumers to spend their money when they please .

" it would be good if the states do not approve more than four sundays a year that stores can stay open , " said merkel . changes ahead the reform package will be voted on july 7 by germany 's upper house of parliament .

over 90 percent of visitors said it really is " a time to make friends . " millions of fans descended on germany during the opening stages of the world cup , and while some have already followed their teams home and others look for last-minute bargains on airfare to berlin , a study published monday showed nearly all of them enjoyed their time in the country . " germany has created an excellent atmosphere and image of itself , " said alfons madeja , a sports scientist , while presenting the study .
" the world cup has also contributed to a new , natural and healthy german sense of self-confidence . " just over 93 percent of the 5,000 soccer fans from around the world who took part in the study gave the host country an overall grade of good to very good , madeja told the german dpa news agency . eating , drinking and partying win out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are one of you in the wrong section ?
friendship and the bare necessities proved to be what most fans were looking to get out of their trip to germany .
at 88.7 percent , meeting people from other countries was nearly as important as the triumvirate of " eating , drinking and partying , " according to the study . the venues ' elaborate cultural programs , on the other hand , did n't fare as well .
music concerts were the most popular part of the non-soccer program , catching the interest of 43.1 percent of foreign visitors . " art and culture are , however , an important factor in repeat visits , " according to a study of the 2004 european championships . only 4 percent of the respondents came to germany alone while 64 percent came in with friends . " there were a lot of men coming in clubs who had previously traveled to several world and european cups in the past , " madeja said , adding that the rest of the visitors came with family members . changing the image of germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are n't used to taking shelter under the flag the stereotypical view of germans as orderly and reserved also changed in a number of minds , according to madeja . " we showed emotion and finally were not afraid to be happy , express our pride and joy and show our national colors , " he added . but germans still held on to their image as organized and efficient while presenting the country as a safe place to visit with a short supply of good cooks . safety , ease of transportation and organization all ranked well in the survey , while the quality of food left about one of four people looking for something else to eat . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer 's gain is the entertainment and travel industry 's loss the world cup has made homebodies of film buffs and theatergoers , who stay glued to the tube instead of going out .
result : a temporary dip in the german entertainment sector .
-lrb- june 29 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : germany finally gets an image makeover the full significance of germany holding the world cup has just started to register .
in its typically understated manner , the country is winning over its critics - just by being itself .

german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- has come under fire over a new health reform deal proposed on monday . according to the deal which was hammered out after late-night talks sunday , healthcare contributions paid by employees and their employers will increase from the beginning of next year by around half a percentage point to help close a massive funding gap . in addition , around 1.5 billion in tax revenue will go toward health insurance for children in 2008 and double that amount in 2009 . " this is an important breakthrough we have succeeded in making , " merkel said monday after the late-night huddle . however , a day later finance minister peer steinbrück said the financing plans for children 's healthcare were not yet fixed .
in tuesday 's edition of the handelsblatt daily , steinbrück said " we have not yet agreed to the finance format . " merkel 's health reform thwarts the plan by the spd coalition partners , who had sought an increase in tax to meet the funding shortfall .

"
in the end , " patients would be the winners " of the deal , he said . the reforms drew the ire of guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , the biggest opposition group .
westerwelle said the proposals reminded him of a planned economy and had " nothing to do with free competition . "
westerwelle accused the coalition government of using the distraction around the football world cup to " cash up . " industry says health reforms stifle employment big business has argued that the reforms will make it even more expensive to hire new employees .

german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- has come under fire over a new health reform deal proposed on monday . according to the deal which was hammered out after late-night talks sunday , healthcare contributions paid by employees and their employers will increase from the beginning of next year by around half a percentage point to help close a massive funding gap . in addition , around 1.5 billion in tax revenue will go toward health insurance for children in 2008 and double that amount in 2009 . " this is an important breakthrough we have succeeded in making , " merkel said monday after the late-night huddle . however , a day later finance minister peer steinbrück said the financing plans for children 's healthcare were not yet fixed .
in tuesday 's edition of the handelsblatt daily , steinbrück said " we have not yet agreed to the finance format . " merkel 's health reform thwarts the plan by the spd coalition partners , who had sought an increase in tax to meet the funding shortfall .

the central council of jews in germany has called for the country 's nazi history to be taught as a separate subject .

" the president will participate in the 2010 handover ceremony and launch the logo for the world cup that we are hosting , " pahad said at a media briefing .
" his visit comes in the context of south africa 's stated commitment to making the 2010 soccer world cup a truly african event , " he said . south africa on sunday are taking over the reigns from germany , having been two years ago awarded the hosting of the first ever world cup to come to the african continent . local officials this week reacted with outrage at a weekend newspaper report which stated fifa was working on a back-up plan to host the event in australia should south africa not be ready in time or fail to curb its perceived high levels of violent crime . world cup 2010 local organizing chief danny jordaan earlier this week described any suggestion to have the world cup moved off the continent as a " laughable notion " and " absolute nonsense .

it was n't until a 3-0 win against ukraine and a spot in the semi-finals that honking , flag-waving cars hit the italian streets . while celebrations are normal occurrences at any point in an international tournament in other countries , a serious match-fixing scandal has had italians restrained about honoring their soccer stars . until now . even after juventus coach fabio capello stepped down from his position after testifying at a match-fixing hearing on tuesday , many in italy expect a win over germany in the semi-finals would make rome erupt in a party atmosphere that would make the previous celebrations look like matchbox motorcades and could even bring back a sense of pride to a soccer-crazed people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calls for and against italy have been closely watched extra attention being paid to italians the azzurri are desperate to put in a solid showing and prove to their fans that even while a match-fixing trial is underway back home , not all of italian soccer deserves to be condemned .
the italians are paying close attention to their behavior at the same time an investigation involving four top clubs that employ half the national team continues . " they 're going to have to be attentive to their behavior , " italian players ' association president sergio campana said when the team arrived in germany .
" with all that 's going on in our sport , this team is going to be kept under the microscope even more than usual . " whenever they return home , the italians will likely be seen as in a light similar to the stage 's other tragic heroes - and not for their theatrical dives and acting on the field - after trudging through an opera set with everything from fixing team rosters to wiretaps and betting on matches . italian soccer federation prosecutor stefano palazzi called for the relegation of ac milan , juventus , lazio and fiorentina on the third day of a trial in rome where 25 people are also suspected of sporting fraud . after a short period of being embarrassed and humiliated by their players ' presence in germany during such a scandal , many italians have come to believe in their national team again . " the -lrb- italian -rrb- players here are playing for the game 's conscience and the game 's future back home , " a corriere della sera reporter told the bbc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wo n't be alone if italy beat germany returning to the team initially divided on whether to support the national team , italy 's advancement has made it harder for italy 's soccer-loving public not to support the team . " germany , we 're going to beat you ! " read a corriere dello sport headline . the daily il corriere della sera also played up support for marcello lippi 's side .
" germany against italy : we are making history . " fans outside of italy have also proved willing to spur on the azzurri . " germany won the 1990 world cup in italy , now italy have to become world champions in germany , " said rinaldo luongo , the italian owner of a dortmund pizzeria .
" that would be fair . " looking back at the history of 1982 cup victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy beat germany in 1982 to claim the title italian commentators have become more and more willing to examine , without over hyping , the similarities between the 2006 tournament and the last time italy claimed the world cup title in 1982 . though the italians also entered that tournament in spain embroiled in a match fixing scandal , it was two years old and long forgotten history as the team took the field and won the final match against germany with paolo rossi , who had earlier served a suspension for his role , claiming the cup 's golden boot . two of the four italian clubs accused of corruption , milan and lazio , where relegated in 1980 . in 2006 , it 's juventus coach capello who made the first step by resigning after the club was set to be relegated at least two divisions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.07.2006 poland marks 60th anniversary of anti-semitic pogrom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a new memorial for those killed in the largest postwar pogrom poland on tuesday marked the 60th anniversary of the biggest pogrom to take place after world war ii .
it killed about 40 jews in kielce and led to an exodus of polish jews who survived the holocaust . first came the rumors ; then came the violence .
in the end , 42 people , all but three jewish , were murdered in the polish town of kielce , in what is known as europe 's last pogrom , one year after the surrender of the nazis . for decades , this event in poland 's past lay unexamined by many poles themselves .
but now that is changing as the eu member prepares to unveil a new monument and hold ceremonies marking the day that set off an exodus of jews into exile . " each and every country has its history , " piotr kadlczik , chairman of the union of jewish communities , told polish radio .
" and in this history , it has moments of which it can be proud or ashamed .
to make a selection by thinking only about the proud moments makes this history poorer . "
one violent night on july 4 , 1946 , a rumor began to circulate that a jewish family had kidnapped a christian child and held him in a cellar overnight .
the rumor soon grew and , as rumors do , took on incredible dimensions .
word had it that the small jewish community of kielce needed to have blood transfusions from christians to exist , to make matzos , jewish unleavened bread ; skulls and skeletons were in the cellar of jewish families , due to ritual killings . the father of the missing boy - who was actually sleeping at a friend 's house - asked police to investigate .
the father , neighbors , police and members of the communist militia went to planty street , home to the town 's jews . soon after , a police officer ordered the jews to hand over their weapons , and it was then that the first shots were fired .
no one can say with certainty who opened fire on whom , but the resulting battle with guns and clubs drew in soldiers , the police and civilians , who either shot the jews or beat them to death .
some were thrown out of the windows of apartment blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only about 250,000 polish jews out of 3.5 million survived the holocaust thirty-seven jews and three non-jewish poles were killed that day .
the incident was followed by other attacks on jews in the city several days later that killed up to 1,500 jews . and it prompted polish jews - once the largest jewish community in europe numbering 3.5 million before the nazis killed 90 percent of them - to flee in droves after surviving the holocaust : in the three months following the pogrom , around 70,000 jews left poland - more than the 50,000 who had emigrated during the entire year before . " after the kielce pogrom , the situation had inexorably changed , " historian bozena szaynok of wroclaw university told afp .
" right after the war , many jews emigrated to palestine , because they saw poland as a huge cemetery where they could no longer live .
after the pogrom , there was a real atmosphere of panic among jews .
they no longer felt that poland was safe for them . " ripe for violence even though there were other smaller pogroms in hungary and romania , the post-war atmosphere in poland was particularly ripe for the kielce pogrom , historians say . " the pogrom would never have happened if not for the climate of anti-semitism in poland at the time , where jews were dehumanized , seen as having been ' punished ' in the war , and the myth of the communist jew , who brought the hated communists to power , was freely spread , " historian andrzej paczkowski told afp . " poles feared that jews who survived the war would return and demand that the homes they abandoned when they fled the nazis be returned to them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new polish jewish museum is planned in 2008 for warsaw and even though the polish government apologized for the pogrom 10 years ago , many say that poles still largely see themselves as victims during and after the war and have failed to come to terms with anti-semitism , even today . " the tragic death of polish jews is something that has never been properly mourned here , " jan t. gross , a polish-american author of books on poles and jews told the associated press .
" and the absence of mourning is something that has to be remedied because it weighs on the collective consciousness of the society . " his latest book , " fear , " is largely about the kielce pogrom and post-war anti-semitism in poland . modern anti-semitism more recently , the recent entry of the far-right league of polish families party - which has its origins in a pre-war anti-semitic party - into the conservative coalition government has raised concerns about anti-semitism in poland .
even pope benedict has warned the far right and its religious radio station , radio maryja , about its questionable comments regarding jews . and in may , poland 's chief rabbi michael schudrich was attacked in warsaw by a pole who allegedly has ties to neo-nazi groups . " there is anti-semitism in poland today , " he told the bbc .
" it , however , still does not play a significant role in society , in large measure thanks to the teachings of john paul ii .
the level of anti-semitism here is actually far less than in almost any other european country today . " after sirens wailed at 4 p.m.
tuesday , schudrich led jewish prayers at the ceremonies after the unveiling of a monument to the victims - and trees commemorating the victims have also been planted as a reminder of the town 's sad history . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former polish skinhead appointed to high public post the former editor of a polish neo-nazi magazine has been appointed as deputy chairman of poland 's public tv network , sending shockwaves through the new eu member country .

over 90 percent of visitors said it really is " a time to make friends . " millions of fans descended on germany during the opening stages of the world cup , and while some have already followed their teams home and others look for last-minute bargains on airfare to berlin , a study published monday showed nearly all of them enjoyed their time in the country . " germany has created an excellent atmosphere and image of itself , " said alfons madeja , a sports scientist , while presenting the study .
" the world cup has also contributed to a new , natural and healthy german sense of self-confidence . " just over 93 percent of the 5,000 soccer fans from around the world who took part in the study gave the host country an overall grade of good to very good , madeja told the german dpa news agency . eating , drinking and partying win out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are one of you in the wrong section ?
friendship and the bare necessities proved to be what most fans were looking to get out of their trip to germany .
at 88.7 percent , meeting people from other countries was nearly as important as the triumvirate of " eating , drinking and partying , " according to the study . the venues ' elaborate cultural programs , on the other hand , did n't fare as well .
music concerts were the most popular part of the non-soccer program , catching the interest of 43.1 percent of foreign visitors . " art and culture are , however , an important factor in repeat visits , " according to a study of the 2004 european championships . only 4 percent of the respondents came to germany alone while 64 percent came in with friends . " there were a lot of men coming in clubs who had previously traveled to several world and european cups in the past , " madeja said , adding that the rest of the visitors came with family members . changing the image of germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are n't used to taking shelter under the flag the stereotypical view of germans as orderly and reserved also changed in a number of minds , according to madeja . " we showed emotion and finally were not afraid to be happy , express our pride and joy and show our national colors , " he added . but germans still held on to their image as organized and efficient while presenting the country as a safe place to visit with a short supply of good cooks . safety , ease of transportation and organization all ranked well in the survey , while the quality of food left about one of four people looking for something else to eat . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer 's gain is the entertainment and travel industry 's loss the world cup has made homebodies of film buffs and theatergoers , who stay glued to the tube instead of going out .

" the president will participate in the 2010 handover ceremony and launch the logo for the world cup that we are hosting , " pahad said at a media briefing .
" his visit comes in the context of south africa 's stated commitment to making the 2010 soccer world cup a truly african event , " he said . south africa on sunday are taking over the reigns from germany , having been two years ago awarded the hosting of the first ever world cup to come to the african continent . local officials this week reacted with outrage at a weekend newspaper report which stated fifa was working on a back-up plan to host the event in australia should south africa not be ready in time or fail to curb its perceived high levels of violent crime . world cup 2010 local organizing chief danny jordaan earlier this week described any suggestion to have the world cup moved off the continent as a " laughable notion " and " absolute nonsense .

the whole country goes into mourning but dw-world.de believes germany still has plenty to celebrate even though the dream is now over . " we 're going to berlin " the euphoric fans were singing .
even those travelling to fan fests and bars all over germany were singing the refrain ; not a joyous exclamation of their actual destination but a song proclaiming the widely held belief that germany 's destiny was the world cup final in the capital on july 9 . they did get to berlin , on june 30 .
and they won there - beating argentina in a nail-biting , quarter-final climax - but they wo n't be going back to contest the world cup in the final .
germany 's dream of watching their home team raise the golden trophy in triumph ended when italy not only crashed the party but ate all the food , drank all the champagne and went home with the family silver stuffed up their shirts . for this was a smash-and-grab raid of the most heartless kind .
germany - not so much a country in the last few weeks , but a living , breathing unified entity - was ready to follows its team along its pre-destined path to the title and to then fall into a rapture which would quite possibly never end . that was the belief .
the country was riding a wave unlike anything felt in the last 15 years .
it was not only a hope that germany would win but it seemed to be a very poorly kept secret among the white-shirted millions which had turned a recently depressed and morose nation into the world 's biggest festival site .
no one doubted the outcome . klinsi 's kids came from nowhere to bring hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was supposed to be so different it was all very different before the world cup .
jürgen klinsmann 's team was already written-off before the first ball was kicked in anger .
but when the action started , this team of youngsters showed a desire and flair that no-one , not even the most enthusiastic fan , would have expected . but when the players started to deliver in such style , the country started to wonder .
and then they started to hope .
then they started to believe .
it was infectious and the team 's performances seemed to flow with an energy generated from hamburg to munich , from cologne to berlin . this is why the italian victory is such a blow to germany .
any team would be deflated by defeat , leaving the world stage to others who will compete for the trophy they thought they were destined to lift .
a country which wanted a world cup win on home soil so badly can only feel an emotion close to bereavement after such a loss . positive vibe must continue in host nation but while the bubble has so cruelly burst , there are huge positives to take from germany 's world cup experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans should be proud of their team and their world cup as a team , germany actually performed above all expectations and should be honoured and proud of their showing .
they should harness this new attacking flair , nurture it further and come back even stronger , possibly creating a new german legacy of soccer dominance in the future . as a people , the germans should refuse to let such a defeat rob them of their new enthusiasm and to channel the pride in their country and the new respect from outside their borders into a new positive way of living .
they have showed that germany can be an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the germans have consigned many of their stereotypes to a history pre-2006 through welcoming the world and showing it how to party . while the post-match trauma will no doubt lead to a river of tears which will flow through the country , germany must get a grip as soon as possible if this world cup is n't going to deflate entirely .
the germans now have a responsibility to put on their make-up once more , hold the flags proudly aloft again and continue to sing of travelling to berlin .
because the final party is not going to be anywhere near as fun without the hosts in attendance . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hope win in germany eases scandal at home after an initial ambivalence concerning their team 's world cup chances , italians have come around to supporting the azzurri in their semi-final match against hosts germany .

german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- has come under fire over a new health reform deal proposed on monday . according to the deal which was hammered out after late-night talks sunday , healthcare contributions paid by employees and their employers will increase from the beginning of next year by around half a percentage point to help close a massive funding gap . in addition , around 1.5 billion in tax revenue will go toward health insurance for children in 2008 and double that amount in 2009 . " this is an important breakthrough we have succeeded in making , " merkel said monday after the late-night huddle . however , a day later finance minister peer steinbrück said the financing plans for children 's healthcare were not yet fixed .
in tuesday 's edition of the handelsblatt daily , steinbrück said " we have not yet agreed to the finance format . " merkel 's health reform thwarts the plan by the spd coalition partners , who had sought an increase in tax to meet the funding shortfall .
merkel rejected the tax hike partly because the electorate already faces a rise in sales tax next year . spd critical of health reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat leader , kurt beck on tuesday , the leader of the spd , kurt beck , told the daily mainzer allgemeinen zeitung he had hoped to be able to lower contributions but that " one has to make compromises in a coalition . "
in the end , " patients would be the winners " of the deal , he said . the reforms drew the ire of guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , the biggest opposition group .
westerwelle said the proposals reminded him of a planned economy and had " nothing to do with free competition . "
westerwelle accused the coalition government of using the distraction around the football world cup to " cash up . " industry says health reforms stifle employment big business has argued that the reforms will make it even more expensive to hire new employees .
statutory healthcare costs are currently 14 percent of an employee 's wage , split between worker and employer . the president of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , ludwig georg braun told the daily neuen osnabrücker zeitung on tuesday that the increase in non-wage labor costs means that firms wo n't be able afford to expand their workforce .
he called for set health care contributions independent of wages . the head of the panel of six economic advisors to the government , bert rürup , called the reform a " rather modest compromise based on the lowest common denominator . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics says germany 's health care system is too bureaucratic germany 's 123-year-old public health system is widely criticized for its bloated bureaucracy and lack of transparency . according the organization for economic co-operation and development , germany spends close to 11 percent of its gross domestic product on healthcare , more than france , austria , the netherlands , italy , britain and spain . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government agrees on health , corporate tax reform germany 's ruling coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- said after all-night talks that it had agreed on parts of key reforms to healthcare and corporate taxation .
-lrb- july 3 , 2006 -rrb- german health system not quite in intensive care going by media reports and public opinion in germany , one might think the country 's health care system is sclerotic and near collapse .
but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- vat increase puts germany closer to eu average the 3 percent value-added tax increase that was part of chancellor angela merkel 's election campaign did n't come as a surprise to anyone in germany , but that does n't mean everyone is willing to accept it .

surrounded by the euphoria of seeing the national team move into the semi-finals , germans are going to unusual lengths to make sure they enjoy the game and - hopefully - post-match celebrations . an event that comes around only once every four years , germany is pulling out all the stops to make sure as many people as possible experience the world cup on home soil to the fullest . take the example of a munich politician concerned about school kids ' sleeping habits . worried that students ' mathematical ability will be limited to tallying goals after a late night of watching germany play italy in the world cup semi-finals , munich social democrat franz maget wanted students get some extra sleep after the game and before trudging off to school . maget suggested starting the state 's schools 30 minutes later to cut down on eye rubbing after tuesday night 's 9:00 p.m. kick-off . " school children also want to see the game , " he said , adding that a penalty shoot-out , such as the one germany needed to beat argentina , could keep kids up long past their bedtime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one last look , then i 'm headed to watch the game soccer mania surpasses car craze some german car companies have also come to terms with the fact that , even in a country as automobile crazy as germany , repair rates for cars made after tuesday 's 9:00 p.m. kick-off could skyrocket as employees ' ability to concentrate on the job plummets when die mannschaft take on the azzurri in dortmund . daimlerchrysler decided to cut one shift from the production schedule in sindelfingen so some 10,000 workers can watch the game .

some crafty stores have even skirted the sunday shopping ban by claiming tourists as shoppers as these shops are allowed an exemption . but now , germany 's parliament , busy with federal reform , has decided to repeal a 1956 " store closing law " and make it easier for consumers to spend their money when they please . " germany has a too complicated and protracted decision-making process , " chancellor angela merkel told parliament last week . regional decisions the repeal of the ladenschlussgesetz -lrb- store closing law -rrb- is part of a series of 25 measures to reform the federal system to give the 16 states more power in matters of health , education , wages and prisons .

" it would be good if the states do not approve more than four sundays a year that stores can stay open , " said merkel . changes ahead the reform package will be voted on july 7 by germany 's upper house of parliament .

it was n't until a 3-0 win against ukraine and a spot in the semi-finals that honking , flag-waving cars hit the italian streets . while celebrations are normal occurrences at any point in an international tournament in other countries , a serious match-fixing scandal has had italians restrained about honoring their soccer stars . until now . even after juventus coach fabio capello stepped down from his position after testifying at a match-fixing hearing on tuesday , many in italy expect a win over germany in the semi-finals would make rome erupt in a party atmosphere that would make the previous celebrations look like matchbox motorcades and could even bring back a sense of pride to a soccer-crazed people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calls for and against italy have been closely watched extra attention being paid to italians the azzurri are desperate to put in a solid showing and prove to their fans that even while a match-fixing trial is underway back home , not all of italian soccer deserves to be condemned .
the italians are paying close attention to their behavior at the same time an investigation involving four top clubs that employ half the national team continues . " they 're going to have to be attentive to their behavior , " italian players ' association president sergio campana said when the team arrived in germany .
" with all that 's going on in our sport , this team is going to be kept under the microscope even more than usual . " whenever they return home , the italians will likely be seen as in a light similar to the stage 's other tragic heroes - and not for their theatrical dives and acting on the field - after trudging through an opera set with everything from fixing team rosters to wiretaps and betting on matches . italian soccer federation prosecutor stefano palazzi called for the relegation of ac milan , juventus , lazio and fiorentina on the third day of a trial in rome where 25 people are also suspected of sporting fraud . after a short period of being embarrassed and humiliated by their players ' presence in germany during such a scandal , many italians have come to believe in their national team again . " the -lrb- italian -rrb- players here are playing for the game 's conscience and the game 's future back home , " a corriere della sera reporter told the bbc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wo n't be alone if italy beat germany returning to the team initially divided on whether to support the national team , italy 's advancement has made it harder for italy 's soccer-loving public not to support the team . " germany , we 're going to beat you ! " read a corriere dello sport headline . the daily il corriere della sera also played up support for marcello lippi 's side .
" germany against italy : we are making history . " fans outside of italy have also proved willing to spur on the azzurri . " germany won the 1990 world cup in italy , now italy have to become world champions in germany , " said rinaldo luongo , the italian owner of a dortmund pizzeria .
" that would be fair . " looking back at the history of 1982 cup victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy beat germany in 1982 to claim the title italian commentators have become more and more willing to examine , without over hyping , the similarities between the 2006 tournament and the last time italy claimed the world cup title in 1982 . though the italians also entered that tournament in spain embroiled in a match fixing scandal , it was two years old and long forgotten history as the team took the field and won the final match against germany with paolo rossi , who had earlier served a suspension for his role , claiming the cup 's golden boot . two of the four italian clubs accused of corruption , milan and lazio , where relegated in 1980 . in 2006 , it 's juventus coach capello who made the first step by resigning after the club was set to be relegated at least two divisions .
palazzi recommended the other three teams be relegated to the second division . the jury is still out on what will exactly will happen to all four teams - and the italian national team . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : who should win the world cup and why germany , italy , portugal and france .
one of these teams will win the 2006 world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de features -pipe- 04.07.2006 the world cup is over for germany but the party must continue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's world cup dream died in the last two minutes of extra-time despite the prayers hosts germany are out of the world cup after losing to italy .
the whole country goes into mourning but dw-world.de believes germany still has plenty to celebrate even though the dream is now over . " we 're going to berlin " the euphoric fans were singing .
even those travelling to fan fests and bars all over germany were singing the refrain ; not a joyous exclamation of their actual destination but a song proclaiming the widely held belief that germany 's destiny was the world cup final in the capital on july 9 . they did get to berlin , on june 30 .
and they won there - beating argentina in a nail-biting , quarter-final climax - but they wo n't be going back to contest the world cup in the final .
germany 's dream of watching their home team raise the golden trophy in triumph ended when italy not only crashed the party but ate all the food , drank all the champagne and went home with the family silver stuffed up their shirts . for this was a smash-and-grab raid of the most heartless kind .
germany - not so much a country in the last few weeks , but a living , breathing unified entity - was ready to follows its team along its pre-destined path to the title and to then fall into a rapture which would quite possibly never end . that was the belief .
the country was riding a wave unlike anything felt in the last 15 years .
it was not only a hope that germany would win but it seemed to be a very poorly kept secret among the white-shirted millions which had turned a recently depressed and morose nation into the world 's biggest festival site .
no one doubted the outcome . klinsi 's kids came from nowhere to bring hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was supposed to be so different it was all very different before the world cup .
jürgen klinsmann 's team was already written-off before the first ball was kicked in anger .
but when the action started , this team of youngsters showed a desire and flair that no-one , not even the most enthusiastic fan , would have expected . but when the players started to deliver in such style , the country started to wonder .
and then they started to hope .
then they started to believe .
it was infectious and the team 's performances seemed to flow with an energy generated from hamburg to munich , from cologne to berlin . this is why the italian victory is such a blow to germany .
any team would be deflated by defeat , leaving the world stage to others who will compete for the trophy they thought they were destined to lift .
a country which wanted a world cup win on home soil so badly can only feel an emotion close to bereavement after such a loss . positive vibe must continue in host nation but while the bubble has so cruelly burst , there are huge positives to take from germany 's world cup experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans should be proud of their team and their world cup as a team , germany actually performed above all expectations and should be honoured and proud of their showing .
they should harness this new attacking flair , nurture it further and come back even stronger , possibly creating a new german legacy of soccer dominance in the future . as a people , the germans should refuse to let such a defeat rob them of their new enthusiasm and to channel the pride in their country and the new respect from outside their borders into a new positive way of living .
they have showed that germany can be an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .

" we 're already highly focused , " germany team manager oliver bierhoff said .
" we 're really looking forward to playing in dortmund .
that 'll really be an advantage for us , since the atmosphere should be unbelievable . " germany have never lost in dortmund , winning 13 of their 14 internationals played there . but italy can take heart from their excellent record against germany in the world cup with two wins and two draws in four meetings , including epic victories in the 1970 semi-final and the 1982 final . francesco totti , whose performance in the 3-0 quarter-final win over ukraine was his best of the tournament so far , wants italy to emulate the great azzurri teams of the past by adding another famous victory against their old foes . dortmund crowd a boost for germans , challenge for italians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans have great memories of the 1-0 win against poland in dortmund " on tuesday we want to write another chapter in the duel , " said the roma captain .
" to beat germany in their own country in front of a hostile crowd , well it could n't get any better than that . " despite some unconvincing performances on their way to the semis , italy boast a 23-match unbeaten run - their best streak since 1939 - and defender fabio grosso believes they can break german hearts at the westfalenstadion . " we 're taking on a great team that has the backing of the whole country , but we believe in ourselves , " grosso said .
" we need to play like we know how and put them in difficulty . " friendly defeat belongs in history books bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans are convinced they wo n't be leaving the field with the heads against italy again italy showed the germans just how difficult they can be with a humiliating 4-1 drubbing in a friendly four months ago , leading much of the german press to call for coach jürgen klinsmann 's head .
but italian trainer marcello lippi insisted that result will have no bearing on tuesday 's clash . " we wo n't score four goals against germany again , " lippi said .
" they 're not the same side we met in march .
now they are exploiting the enthusiasm of the whole nation and it has transformed them . " bierhoff added that 4-1 loss was " no longer a reference point " for the german team . " the defeat really scarred us , and we played absolutely awfully , " he said .
" now we 're on top form though , both mentally and physically , and there 's no way that something like that could ever happen again . " klinsmann , who stated winning the tournament on home soil is his only goal , added that his side is capable of beating the azzurri . " italy are one of the best teams in the world , and that is why they are in the final four , " said klinsmann .
" but we think if we play our own game we can beat them .
i believe the confidence that we have built over the last six weeks is enough to win the next two games and become world champions . " crucial players missing on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings was suspended for having a role in a post-match brawl italy defender alessandro nesta is almost certain to miss his third straight match due to a groin strain , while germany will be without midfielder torsten frings , who was suspended for the semi-final by fifa , world soccer 's governing body , for his role in a scuffle following germany 's match against argentina . the hosts will be able to keep captain michael ballack on the roster .
a question mark remained next to his name after serious cramps during the team 's quarter-final . fifa statistics show the germans are the most offensively minded of the teams in the 2006 tournament with 88 shots on goal , while the italians have proved to be nearly unbeatable in their own penalty area by giving up just one goal - an own goal . the winner of tuesday 's game will go on to face either portugal or france in the final in berlin on july 9 .

it killed about 40 jews in kielce and led to an exodus of polish jews who survived the holocaust . first came the rumors ; then came the violence .
in the end , 42 people , all but three jewish , were murdered in the polish town of kielce , in what is known as europe 's last pogrom , one year after the surrender of the nazis . for decades , this event in poland 's past lay unexamined by many poles themselves .
but now that is changing as the eu member prepares to unveil a new monument and hold ceremonies marking the day that set off an exodus of jews into exile . " each and every country has its history , " piotr kadlczik , chairman of the union of jewish communities , told polish radio .
" and in this history , it has moments of which it can be proud or ashamed .
to make a selection by thinking only about the proud moments makes this history poorer . "
one violent night on july 4 , 1946 , a rumor began to circulate that a jewish family had kidnapped a christian child and held him in a cellar overnight .
the rumor soon grew and , as rumors do , took on incredible dimensions .
word had it that the small jewish community of kielce needed to have blood transfusions from christians to exist , to make matzos , jewish unleavened bread ; skulls and skeletons were in the cellar of jewish families , due to ritual killings . the father of the missing boy - who was actually sleeping at a friend 's house - asked police to investigate .
the father , neighbors , police and members of the communist militia went to planty street , home to the town 's jews . soon after , a police officer ordered the jews to hand over their weapons , and it was then that the first shots were fired .
no one can say with certainty who opened fire on whom , but the resulting battle with guns and clubs drew in soldiers , the police and civilians , who either shot the jews or beat them to death .
some were thrown out of the windows of apartment blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only about 250,000 polish jews out of 3.5 million survived the holocaust thirty-seven jews and three non-jewish poles were killed that day .
the incident was followed by other attacks on jews in the city several days later that killed up to 1,500 jews . and it prompted polish jews - once the largest jewish community in europe numbering 3.5 million before the nazis killed 90 percent of them - to flee in droves after surviving the holocaust : in the three months following the pogrom , around 70,000 jews left poland - more than the 50,000 who had emigrated during the entire year before . " after the kielce pogrom , the situation had inexorably changed , " historian bozena szaynok of wroclaw university told afp .
" right after the war , many jews emigrated to palestine , because they saw poland as a huge cemetery where they could no longer live .
after the pogrom , there was a real atmosphere of panic among jews .
they no longer felt that poland was safe for them . " ripe for violence even though there were other smaller pogroms in hungary and romania , the post-war atmosphere in poland was particularly ripe for the kielce pogrom , historians say . " the pogrom would never have happened if not for the climate of anti-semitism in poland at the time , where jews were dehumanized , seen as having been ' punished ' in the war , and the myth of the communist jew , who brought the hated communists to power , was freely spread , " historian andrzej paczkowski told afp . " poles feared that jews who survived the war would return and demand that the homes they abandoned when they fled the nazis be returned to them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new polish jewish museum is planned in 2008 for warsaw and even though the polish government apologized for the pogrom 10 years ago , many say that poles still largely see themselves as victims during and after the war and have failed to come to terms with anti-semitism , even today . " the tragic death of polish jews is something that has never been properly mourned here , " jan t. gross , a polish-american author of books on poles and jews told the associated press .
" and the absence of mourning is something that has to be remedied because it weighs on the collective consciousness of the society . " his latest book , " fear , " is largely about the kielce pogrom and post-war anti-semitism in poland . modern anti-semitism more recently , the recent entry of the far-right league of polish families party - which has its origins in a pre-war anti-semitic party - into the conservative coalition government has raised concerns about anti-semitism in poland .
even pope benedict has warned the far right and its religious radio station , radio maryja , about its questionable comments regarding jews . and in may , poland 's chief rabbi michael schudrich was attacked in warsaw by a pole who allegedly has ties to neo-nazi groups . " there is anti-semitism in poland today , " he told the bbc .
" it , however , still does not play a significant role in society , in large measure thanks to the teachings of john paul ii .
the level of anti-semitism here is actually far less than in almost any other european country today . " after sirens wailed at 4 p.m.

it killed about 40 jews in kielce and led to an exodus of polish jews who survived the holocaust . first came the rumors ; then came the violence .
in the end , 42 people , all but three jewish , were murdered in the polish town of kielce , in what is known as europe 's last pogrom , one year after the surrender of the nazis . for decades , this event in poland 's past lay unexamined by many poles themselves .
but now that is changing as the eu member prepares to unveil a new monument and hold ceremonies marking the day that set off an exodus of jews into exile . " each and every country has its history , " piotr kadlczik , chairman of the union of jewish communities , told polish radio .
" and in this history , it has moments of which it can be proud or ashamed .
to make a selection by thinking only about the proud moments makes this history poorer . "
one violent night on july 4 , 1946 , a rumor began to circulate that a jewish family had kidnapped a christian child and held him in a cellar overnight .
the rumor soon grew and , as rumors do , took on incredible dimensions .
word had it that the small jewish community of kielce needed to have blood transfusions from christians to exist , to make matzos , jewish unleavened bread ; skulls and skeletons were in the cellar of jewish families , due to ritual killings . the father of the missing boy - who was actually sleeping at a friend 's house - asked police to investigate .
the father , neighbors , police and members of the communist militia went to planty street , home to the town 's jews . soon after , a police officer ordered the jews to hand over their weapons , and it was then that the first shots were fired .
no one can say with certainty who opened fire on whom , but the resulting battle with guns and clubs drew in soldiers , the police and civilians , who either shot the jews or beat them to death .
some were thrown out of the windows of apartment blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only about 250,000 polish jews out of 3.5 million survived the holocaust thirty-seven jews and three non-jewish poles were killed that day .
the incident was followed by other attacks on jews in the city several days later that killed up to 1,500 jews . and it prompted polish jews - once the largest jewish community in europe numbering 3.5 million before the nazis killed 90 percent of them - to flee in droves after surviving the holocaust : in the three months following the pogrom , around 70,000 jews left poland - more than the 50,000 who had emigrated during the entire year before . " after the kielce pogrom , the situation had inexorably changed , " historian bozena szaynok of wroclaw university told afp .
" right after the war , many jews emigrated to palestine , because they saw poland as a huge cemetery where they could no longer live .
after the pogrom , there was a real atmosphere of panic among jews .
they no longer felt that poland was safe for them . " ripe for violence even though there were other smaller pogroms in hungary and romania , the post-war atmosphere in poland was particularly ripe for the kielce pogrom , historians say . " the pogrom would never have happened if not for the climate of anti-semitism in poland at the time , where jews were dehumanized , seen as having been ' punished ' in the war , and the myth of the communist jew , who brought the hated communists to power , was freely spread , " historian andrzej paczkowski told afp .

" germany have never lost in dortmund , winning 13 of their 14 internationals played there . but italy can take heart from their excellent record against germany in the world cup with two wins and two draws in four meetings , including epic victories in the 1970 semi-final and the 1982 final . francesco totti , whose performance in the 3-0 quarter-final win over ukraine was his best of the tournament so far , wants italy to emulate the great azzurri teams of the past by adding another famous victory against their old foes . dortmund crowd a boost for germans , challenge for italians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans have great memories of the 1-0 win against poland in dortmund " on tuesday we want to write another chapter in the duel , " said the roma captain .
" to beat germany in their own country in front of a hostile crowd , well it could n't get any better than that . " despite some unconvincing performances on their way to the semis , italy boast a 23-match unbeaten run - their best streak since 1939 - and defender fabio grosso believes they can break german hearts at the westfalenstadion . " we 're taking on a great team that has the backing of the whole country , but we believe in ourselves , " grosso said .
" we need to play like we know how and put them in difficulty . " friendly defeat belongs in history books bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans are convinced they wo n't be leaving the field with the heads against italy again italy showed the germans just how difficult they can be with a humiliating 4-1 drubbing in a friendly four months ago , leading much of the german press to call for coach jürgen klinsmann 's head .
but italian trainer marcello lippi insisted that result will have no bearing on tuesday 's clash . " we wo n't score four goals against germany again , " lippi said .
" they 're not the same side we met in march .
now they are exploiting the enthusiasm of the whole nation and it has transformed them . " bierhoff added that 4-1 loss was " no longer a reference point " for the german team . " the defeat really scarred us , and we played absolutely awfully , " he said .
" now we 're on top form though , both mentally and physically , and there 's no way that something like that could ever happen again . " klinsmann , who stated winning the tournament on home soil is his only goal , added that his side is capable of beating the azzurri . " italy are one of the best teams in the world , and that is why they are in the final four , " said klinsmann .
" but we think if we play our own game we can beat them .
i believe the confidence that we have built over the last six weeks is enough to win the next two games and become world champions . " crucial players missing on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings was suspended for having a role in a post-match brawl italy defender alessandro nesta is almost certain to miss his third straight match due to a groin strain , while germany will be without midfielder torsten frings , who was suspended for the semi-final by fifa , world soccer 's governing body , for his role in a scuffle following germany 's match against argentina . the hosts will be able to keep captain michael ballack on the roster .
a question mark remained next to his name after serious cramps during the team 's quarter-final . fifa statistics show the germans are the most offensively minded of the teams in the 2006 tournament with 88 shots on goal , while the italians have proved to be nearly unbeatable in their own penalty area by giving up just one goal - an own goal . the winner of tuesday 's game will go on to face either portugal or france in the final in berlin on july 9 .

the central council of jews in germany has called for the country 's nazi history to be taught as a separate subject .
but teachers ' representatives remain skeptical . charlotte knobloch , the president of the council , said students were taught far too little about the rule of adolf hitler and the holocaust , particularly in the former communist east germany , the online netzeitung reported . " we urgently need to overhaul the way history is taught because far too little attention is paid to national socialism , " knobloch said , adding that the solution would be to devote a course to this chapter of history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch wants to overhaul teaching about the holocaust " it should be made legally binding to do so throughout all of germany 's states , " she added . knobloch , a 73-year-old holocaust survivor , said there were teachers in the former german democratic republic who " hardly know anything about history " .

" no other era of german history is studied as intensively in german schools as national socialism , " kraus said . new dialogue with jews ? however , erdsiek added that in the face of new political challenges such as the rise of right-wing extremism and increasing multiculturalism in society , the council of regional educational ministries was readily prepared to open a dialogue with the central council of jews about a contemporary and didactic revamping of history lessons about the holocaust . the central council of jews in germany is the highest body representing the country 's 110,000 jews .

the central council of jews in germany has called for the country 's nazi history to be taught as a separate subject .
but teachers ' representatives remain skeptical . charlotte knobloch , the president of the council , said students were taught far too little about the rule of adolf hitler and the holocaust , particularly in the former communist east germany , the online netzeitung reported . " we urgently need to overhaul the way history is taught because far too little attention is paid to national socialism , " knobloch said , adding that the solution would be to devote a course to this chapter of history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch wants to overhaul teaching about the holocaust " it should be made legally binding to do so throughout all of germany 's states , " she added . knobloch , a 73-year-old holocaust survivor , said there were teachers in the former german democratic republic who " hardly know anything about history " .
she added that the system of training school teachers in germany had to be overhauled towards that purpose . teachers dismissive of proposal but knobloch 's comments have met with indignation and skepticism from teachers ' unions as well as the council of regional educational ministries . ute erdsiek , president of the council and education minister of the state of schleswig-holstein told news agency ap that the nazi era and the holocaust were a " mandatory , integral and exhaustive " part of history lessons in all forms of schools in germany .
nazism is also a permanent chapter of the teachers ' training program both in western germany as well as the former communist east germany , erdsiek added . the german teachers ' union described knobloch 's proposals as " wrong and not justified . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students near the holocaust memorial in berlin union president josef kraus said teachers were dedicated to teaching the period between 1933 and 1945 " with the necessary time frame and with necessary discernment . "
" no other era of german history is studied as intensively in german schools as national socialism , " kraus said . new dialogue with jews ? however , erdsiek added that in the face of new political challenges such as the rise of right-wing extremism and increasing multiculturalism in society , the council of regional educational ministries was readily prepared to open a dialogue with the central council of jews about a contemporary and didactic revamping of history lessons about the holocaust . the central council of jews in germany is the highest body representing the country 's 110,000 jews .

it was n't until a 3-0 win against ukraine and a spot in the semi-finals that honking , flag-waving cars hit the italian streets . while celebrations are normal occurrences at any point in an international tournament in other countries , a serious match-fixing scandal has had italians restrained about honoring their soccer stars . until now . even after juventus coach fabio capello stepped down from his position after testifying at a match-fixing hearing on tuesday , many in italy expect a win over germany in the semi-finals would make rome erupt in a party atmosphere that would make the previous celebrations look like matchbox motorcades and could even bring back a sense of pride to a soccer-crazed people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calls for and against italy have been closely watched extra attention being paid to italians the azzurri are desperate to put in a solid showing and prove to their fans that even while a match-fixing trial is underway back home , not all of italian soccer deserves to be condemned .
the italians are paying close attention to their behavior at the same time an investigation involving four top clubs that employ half the national team continues . " they 're going to have to be attentive to their behavior , " italian players ' association president sergio campana said when the team arrived in germany .
" with all that 's going on in our sport , this team is going to be kept under the microscope even more than usual . " whenever they return home , the italians will likely be seen as in a light similar to the stage 's other tragic heroes - and not for their theatrical dives and acting on the field - after trudging through an opera set with everything from fixing team rosters to wiretaps and betting on matches . italian soccer federation prosecutor stefano palazzi called for the relegation of ac milan , juventus , lazio and fiorentina on the third day of a trial in rome where 25 people are also suspected of sporting fraud . after a short period of being embarrassed and humiliated by their players ' presence in germany during such a scandal , many italians have come to believe in their national team again . " the -lrb- italian -rrb- players here are playing for the game 's conscience and the game 's future back home , " a corriere della sera reporter told the bbc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wo n't be alone if italy beat germany returning to the team initially divided on whether to support the national team , italy 's advancement has made it harder for italy 's soccer-loving public not to support the team . " germany , we 're going to beat you ! " read a corriere dello sport headline . the daily il corriere della sera also played up support for marcello lippi 's side .
" germany against italy : we are making history . " fans outside of italy have also proved willing to spur on the azzurri . " germany won the 1990 world cup in italy , now italy have to become world champions in germany , " said rinaldo luongo , the italian owner of a dortmund pizzeria .
" that would be fair . " looking back at the history of 1982 cup victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy beat germany in 1982 to claim the title italian commentators have become more and more willing to examine , without over hyping , the similarities between the 2006 tournament and the last time italy claimed the world cup title in 1982 . though the italians also entered that tournament in spain embroiled in a match fixing scandal , it was two years old and long forgotten history as the team took the field and won the final match against germany with paolo rossi , who had earlier served a suspension for his role , claiming the cup 's golden boot . two of the four italian clubs accused of corruption , milan and lazio , where relegated in 1980 . in 2006 , it 's juventus coach capello who made the first step by resigning after the club was set to be relegated at least two divisions .

" the expectations from the whole of the world placed on the brazilians was enormous , " said pele , a world cup winner in 1958 , ' 62 and ' 70 .
" the psychological pressure , too little time to prepare physically and the lack of strategy on the pitch did not help them . " i really hope that this unexpected defeat will be a big lesson for the next world cups , " he added . though pele refused to single out parreira or any individual player he did say that the top players had failed to put in the performances and be motivated the way brazil needed . " the feebleness of the best players at the most important moments did not help , " said pele , who added that despite a poor campaign barcelona ace ronaldinho remained the best player in the world . however , pele recalled that before the finals he had said the favorite for the world cup never takes the biggest prize of them all . " that was always my biggest fear because in 1974 the netherlands were favorites but west germany won , " he said .
" in 1982 , brazil with coach tele santana and a superb squad were favorites , but it was italy who won .

the central council of jews in germany has called for the country 's nazi history to be taught as a separate subject .
but teachers ' representatives remain skeptical . charlotte knobloch , the president of the council , said students were taught far too little about the rule of adolf hitler and the holocaust , particularly in the former communist east germany , the online netzeitung reported . " we urgently need to overhaul the way history is taught because far too little attention is paid to national socialism , " knobloch said , adding that the solution would be to devote a course to this chapter of history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch wants to overhaul teaching about the holocaust " it should be made legally binding to do so throughout all of germany 's states , " she added . knobloch , a 73-year-old holocaust survivor , said there were teachers in the former german democratic republic who " hardly know anything about history " .
she added that the system of training school teachers in germany had to be overhauled towards that purpose . teachers dismissive of proposal but knobloch 's comments have met with indignation and skepticism from teachers ' unions as well as the council of regional educational ministries . ute erdsiek , president of the council and education minister of the state of schleswig-holstein told news agency ap that the nazi era and the holocaust were a " mandatory , integral and exhaustive " part of history lessons in all forms of schools in germany .
nazism is also a permanent chapter of the teachers ' training program both in western germany as well as the former communist east germany , erdsiek added . the german teachers ' union described knobloch 's proposals as " wrong and not justified . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students near the holocaust memorial in berlin union president josef kraus said teachers were dedicated to teaching the period between 1933 and 1945 " with the necessary time frame and with necessary discernment . "
" no other era of german history is studied as intensively in german schools as national socialism , " kraus said . new dialogue with jews ? however , erdsiek added that in the face of new political challenges such as the rise of right-wing extremism and increasing multiculturalism in society , the council of regional educational ministries was readily prepared to open a dialogue with the central council of jews about a contemporary and didactic revamping of history lessons about the holocaust . the central council of jews in germany is the highest body representing the country 's 110,000 jews .

surrounded by the euphoria of seeing the national team move into the semi-finals , germans are going to unusual lengths to make sure they enjoy the game and - hopefully - post-match celebrations . an event that comes around only once every four years , germany is pulling out all the stops to make sure as many people as possible experience the world cup on home soil to the fullest . take the example of a munich politician concerned about school kids ' sleeping habits . worried that students ' mathematical ability will be limited to tallying goals after a late night of watching germany play italy in the world cup semi-finals , munich social democrat franz maget wanted students get some extra sleep after the game and before trudging off to school . maget suggested starting the state 's schools 30 minutes later to cut down on eye rubbing after tuesday night 's 9:00 p.m. kick-off . " school children also want to see the game , " he said , adding that a penalty shoot-out , such as the one germany needed to beat argentina , could keep kids up long past their bedtime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one last look , then i 'm headed to watch the game soccer mania surpasses car craze some german car companies have also come to terms with the fact that , even in a country as automobile crazy as germany , repair rates for cars made after tuesday 's 9:00 p.m. kick-off could skyrocket as employees ' ability to concentrate on the job plummets when die mannschaft take on the azzurri in dortmund . daimlerchrysler decided to cut one shift from the production schedule in sindelfingen so some 10,000 workers can watch the game .
porsche and bmw are also fiddling with their shifts times to allow staff to clock out in time to catch the game . many deutsche bahn employees , however , will be stuck listening to the radio as the rail company puts about 100 more trains on the tracks to help soccer fans get where they are going , and dortmund airport has registered 107 extra flights with more than 1,500 passengers , many of which are coming from italy , according to airport and border control officials . " everything we have that has wheels on it will be rolling on july 4 , " said hubert jung , head of dortmund 's local transportation authority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's nothing quite like cracking open a can of stadium air !
a breath of sweaty , beery arena air even with the extra transportation , not everyone is going to make it to the city , but a bochum-based company wants to make sure soccer fans still get a whiff of the action . stadionluft has filled 25,000 cans with " original stadium air " from the dortmund grounds and put them on sale for 4.95 euros -lrb- $ 6.34 -rrb- per can for the people who are stuck without a ticket but still want to experience the scent that can comes from a fresh pitch mixed with beer and sausages . regardless of where people watch , the german red cross has three tips for fans watching the games outside : put on sunscreen ; choose sturdy footwear over flip flops ; and drink lots of water instead of alcohol . at least two out of three should n't prove too difficult . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de offsides from the fringe soccer : it 's a funny ol ' game .

it killed about 40 jews in kielce and led to an exodus of polish jews who survived the holocaust . first came the rumors ; then came the violence .
in the end , 42 people , all but three jewish , were murdered in the polish town of kielce , in what is known as europe 's last pogrom , one year after the surrender of the nazis . for decades , this event in poland 's past lay unexamined by many poles themselves .
but now that is changing as the eu member prepares to unveil a new monument and hold ceremonies marking the day that set off an exodus of jews into exile . " each and every country has its history , " piotr kadlczik , chairman of the union of jewish communities , told polish radio .
" and in this history , it has moments of which it can be proud or ashamed .
to make a selection by thinking only about the proud moments makes this history poorer . "
one violent night on july 4 , 1946 , a rumor began to circulate that a jewish family had kidnapped a christian child and held him in a cellar overnight .
the rumor soon grew and , as rumors do , took on incredible dimensions .
word had it that the small jewish community of kielce needed to have blood transfusions from christians to exist , to make matzos , jewish unleavened bread ; skulls and skeletons were in the cellar of jewish families , due to ritual killings . the father of the missing boy - who was actually sleeping at a friend 's house - asked police to investigate .
the father , neighbors , police and members of the communist militia went to planty street , home to the town 's jews . soon after , a police officer ordered the jews to hand over their weapons , and it was then that the first shots were fired .
no one can say with certainty who opened fire on whom , but the resulting battle with guns and clubs drew in soldiers , the police and civilians , who either shot the jews or beat them to death .
some were thrown out of the windows of apartment blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only about 250,000 polish jews out of 3.5 million survived the holocaust thirty-seven jews and three non-jewish poles were killed that day .
the incident was followed by other attacks on jews in the city several days later that killed up to 1,500 jews . and it prompted polish jews - once the largest jewish community in europe numbering 3.5 million before the nazis killed 90 percent of them - to flee in droves after surviving the holocaust : in the three months following the pogrom , around 70,000 jews left poland - more than the 50,000 who had emigrated during the entire year before . " after the kielce pogrom , the situation had inexorably changed , " historian bozena szaynok of wroclaw university told afp .
" right after the war , many jews emigrated to palestine , because they saw poland as a huge cemetery where they could no longer live .
after the pogrom , there was a real atmosphere of panic among jews .
they no longer felt that poland was safe for them . " ripe for violence even though there were other smaller pogroms in hungary and romania , the post-war atmosphere in poland was particularly ripe for the kielce pogrom , historians say . " the pogrom would never have happened if not for the climate of anti-semitism in poland at the time , where jews were dehumanized , seen as having been ' punished ' in the war , and the myth of the communist jew , who brought the hated communists to power , was freely spread , " historian andrzej paczkowski told afp . " poles feared that jews who survived the war would return and demand that the homes they abandoned when they fled the nazis be returned to them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new polish jewish museum is planned in 2008 for warsaw and even though the polish government apologized for the pogrom 10 years ago , many say that poles still largely see themselves as victims during and after the war and have failed to come to terms with anti-semitism , even today . " the tragic death of polish jews is something that has never been properly mourned here , " jan t. gross , a polish-american author of books on poles and jews told the associated press .
" and the absence of mourning is something that has to be remedied because it weighs on the collective consciousness of the society . " his latest book , " fear , " is largely about the kielce pogrom and post-war anti-semitism in poland . modern anti-semitism more recently , the recent entry of the far-right league of polish families party - which has its origins in a pre-war anti-semitic party - into the conservative coalition government has raised concerns about anti-semitism in poland .
even pope benedict has warned the far right and its religious radio station , radio maryja , about its questionable comments regarding jews . and in may , poland 's chief rabbi michael schudrich was attacked in warsaw by a pole who allegedly has ties to neo-nazi groups . " there is anti-semitism in poland today , " he told the bbc .
" it , however , still does not play a significant role in society , in large measure thanks to the teachings of john paul ii .
the level of anti-semitism here is actually far less than in almost any other european country today . " after sirens wailed at 4 p.m.

the central council of jews in germany has called for the country 's nazi history to be taught as a separate subject .
but teachers ' representatives remain skeptical . charlotte knobloch , the president of the council , said students were taught far too little about the rule of adolf hitler and the holocaust , particularly in the former communist east germany , the online netzeitung reported . " we urgently need to overhaul the way history is taught because far too little attention is paid to national socialism , " knobloch said , adding that the solution would be to devote a course to this chapter of history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch wants to overhaul teaching about the holocaust " it should be made legally binding to do so throughout all of germany 's states , " she added . knobloch , a 73-year-old holocaust survivor , said there were teachers in the former german democratic republic who " hardly know anything about history " .
she added that the system of training school teachers in germany had to be overhauled towards that purpose . teachers dismissive of proposal but knobloch 's comments have met with indignation and skepticism from teachers ' unions as well as the council of regional educational ministries . ute erdsiek , president of the council and education minister of the state of schleswig-holstein told news agency ap that the nazi era and the holocaust were a " mandatory , integral and exhaustive " part of history lessons in all forms of schools in germany .
nazism is also a permanent chapter of the teachers ' training program both in western germany as well as the former communist east germany , erdsiek added . the german teachers ' union described knobloch 's proposals as " wrong and not justified . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students near the holocaust memorial in berlin union president josef kraus said teachers were dedicated to teaching the period between 1933 and 1945 " with the necessary time frame and with necessary discernment . "
" no other era of german history is studied as intensively in german schools as national socialism , " kraus said . new dialogue with jews ? however , erdsiek added that in the face of new political challenges such as the rise of right-wing extremism and increasing multiculturalism in society , the council of regional educational ministries was readily prepared to open a dialogue with the central council of jews about a contemporary and didactic revamping of history lessons about the holocaust . the central council of jews in germany is the highest body representing the country 's 110,000 jews .

long known for its rigid shopping laws that force stores to close at certain times and on sundays , germany is rethinking consumerism and may abolish the rules . it 's a long tradition in germany : get up early and run to the store on saturday morning to shop for the week , because you might as well forget about picking up anything on sunday . but over the past few years , shops in large german cities have begun staying open longer on weekdays and saturdays to meet consumer demand .
some crafty stores have even skirted the sunday shopping ban by claiming tourists as shoppers as these shops are allowed an exemption . but now , germany 's parliament , busy with federal reform , has decided to repeal a 1956 " store closing law " and make it easier for consumers to spend their money when they please . " germany has a too complicated and protracted decision-making process , " chancellor angela merkel told parliament last week . regional decisions the repeal of the ladenschlussgesetz -lrb- store closing law -rrb- is part of a series of 25 measures to reform the federal system to give the 16 states more power in matters of health , education , wages and prisons .
in exchange for the devolution , the federal government 's power is enhanced by cutting in half the number of laws that must be approved by state legislatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some stores such as ones in train stations are already allowed to stay open on sundays as a result , the states will be able to set their own shopping hours .
currently , stores are required to close by 8 p.m. and stay closed on sundays .
that is later than allowed until 1996 , when shops were required to close by 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and 1 p.m. on saturdays . trade unions have protested the proposed changes the law , saying it helps provide families time together and protects small businesses , which could be pushed out of the market by larger corporations that force their employees to work longer hours . despite the pushing for the reform , government officials said they hope the states do n't change current hours . " it would be good if the states do not approve more than four sundays a year that stores can stay open , " said merkel . changes ahead the reform package will be voted on july 7 by germany 's upper house of parliament .
if approved as expected , the measures will take effect in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup has led some shops to stay open on sundays but no one is coming in berlin , as well as a number of other states , officials said they plan to keep the sunday shopping ban on all but a few sundays each year but will leave other times up to store owners . still , even now in most large german cities such as berlin , munich and hamburg , it is possible to buy goods on sundays at gas stations , train station shops or in certain stores in tourist zones .
the immigrant communities , such as the turks , also often do business on sunday . meanwhile , during the world cup , many stores , such as swedish furniture giant ikea , have taken advantage of a temporary suspension of the shopping rules and have extended their store hours to remain open on sundays . however , a quick look at these stores is telling , as only a few customers can be seen strolling through the aisles as most people are out enjoying the unusually beautiful weather or watching matches dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shops to stay open longer for world cup while german soccer fans hope the home team will rack up the goals , businesses are counting on longer opening hours to fill their cash registers with euros , but not everyone is convinced it will work .

in exchange for the devolution , the federal government 's power is enhanced by cutting in half the number of laws that must be approved by state legislatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some stores such as ones in train stations are already allowed to stay open on sundays as a result , the states will be able to set their own shopping hours .
currently , stores are required to close by 8 p.m. and stay closed on sundays .
that is later than allowed until 1996 , when shops were required to close by 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and 1 p.m. on saturdays . trade unions have protested the proposed changes the law , saying it helps provide families time together and protects small businesses , which could be pushed out of the market by larger corporations that force their employees to work longer hours . despite the pushing for the reform , government officials said they hope the states do n't change current hours . " it would be good if the states do not approve more than four sundays a year that stores can stay open , " said merkel . changes ahead the reform package will be voted on july 7 by germany 's upper house of parliament .
if approved as expected , the measures will take effect in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup has led some shops to stay open on sundays but no one is coming in berlin , as well as a number of other states , officials said they plan to keep the sunday shopping ban on all but a few sundays each year but will leave other times up to store owners . still , even now in most large german cities such as berlin , munich and hamburg , it is possible to buy goods on sundays at gas stations , train station shops or in certain stores in tourist zones .
the immigrant communities , such as the turks , also often do business on sunday . meanwhile , during the world cup , many stores , such as swedish furniture giant ikea , have taken advantage of a temporary suspension of the shopping rules and have extended their store hours to remain open on sundays . however , a quick look at these stores is telling , as only a few customers can be seen strolling through the aisles as most people are out enjoying the unusually beautiful weather or watching matches dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shops to stay open longer for world cup while german soccer fans hope the home team will rack up the goals , businesses are counting on longer opening hours to fill their cash registers with euros , but not everyone is convinced it will work .

" the expectations from the whole of the world placed on the brazilians was enormous , " said pele , a world cup winner in 1958 , ' 62 and ' 70 .
" the psychological pressure , too little time to prepare physically and the lack of strategy on the pitch did not help them . " i really hope that this unexpected defeat will be a big lesson for the next world cups , " he added . though pele refused to single out parreira or any individual player he did say that the top players had failed to put in the performances and be motivated the way brazil needed . " the feebleness of the best players at the most important moments did not help , " said pele , who added that despite a poor campaign barcelona ace ronaldinho remained the best player in the world . however , pele recalled that before the finals he had said the favorite for the world cup never takes the biggest prize of them all . " that was always my biggest fear because in 1974 the netherlands were favorites but west germany won , " he said .
" in 1982 , brazil with coach tele santana and a superb squad were favorites , but it was italy who won . " unfortunately here in germany , it was the same thing , but there again that may be a coincidence .

over 90 percent of visitors said it really is " a time to make friends . " millions of fans descended on germany during the opening stages of the world cup , and while some have already followed their teams home and others look for last-minute bargains on airfare to berlin , a study published monday showed nearly all of them enjoyed their time in the country . " germany has created an excellent atmosphere and image of itself , " said alfons madeja , a sports scientist , while presenting the study .
" the world cup has also contributed to a new , natural and healthy german sense of self-confidence . " just over 93 percent of the 5,000 soccer fans from around the world who took part in the study gave the host country an overall grade of good to very good , madeja told the german dpa news agency . eating , drinking and partying win out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are one of you in the wrong section ?
friendship and the bare necessities proved to be what most fans were looking to get out of their trip to germany .
at 88.7 percent , meeting people from other countries was nearly as important as the triumvirate of " eating , drinking and partying , " according to the study . the venues ' elaborate cultural programs , on the other hand , did n't fare as well .

german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- has come under fire over a new health reform deal proposed on monday . according to the deal which was hammered out after late-night talks sunday , healthcare contributions paid by employees and their employers will increase from the beginning of next year by around half a percentage point to help close a massive funding gap . in addition , around 1.5 billion in tax revenue will go toward health insurance for children in 2008 and double that amount in 2009 . " this is an important breakthrough we have succeeded in making , " merkel said monday after the late-night huddle . however , a day later finance minister peer steinbrück said the financing plans for children 's healthcare were not yet fixed .
in tuesday 's edition of the handelsblatt daily , steinbrück said " we have not yet agreed to the finance format . " merkel 's health reform thwarts the plan by the spd coalition partners , who had sought an increase in tax to meet the funding shortfall .

westerwelle said the proposals reminded him of a planned economy and had " nothing to do with free competition . "
westerwelle accused the coalition government of using the distraction around the football world cup to " cash up . " industry says health reforms stifle employment big business has argued that the reforms will make it even more expensive to hire new employees .
statutory healthcare costs are currently 14 percent of an employee 's wage , split between worker and employer . the president of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , ludwig georg braun told the daily neuen osnabrücker zeitung on tuesday that the increase in non-wage labor costs means that firms wo n't be able afford to expand their workforce .

german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- has come under fire over a new health reform deal proposed on monday . according to the deal which was hammered out after late-night talks sunday , healthcare contributions paid by employees and their employers will increase from the beginning of next year by around half a percentage point to help close a massive funding gap . in addition , around 1.5 billion in tax revenue will go toward health insurance for children in 2008 and double that amount in 2009 . " this is an important breakthrough we have succeeded in making , " merkel said monday after the late-night huddle . however , a day later finance minister peer steinbrück said the financing plans for children 's healthcare were not yet fixed .
in tuesday 's edition of the handelsblatt daily , steinbrück said " we have not yet agreed to the finance format . " merkel 's health reform thwarts the plan by the spd coalition partners , who had sought an increase in tax to meet the funding shortfall .
merkel rejected the tax hike partly because the electorate already faces a rise in sales tax next year . spd critical of health reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat leader , kurt beck on tuesday , the leader of the spd , kurt beck , told the daily mainzer allgemeinen zeitung he had hoped to be able to lower contributions but that " one has to make compromises in a coalition . "
in the end , " patients would be the winners " of the deal , he said . the reforms drew the ire of guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , the biggest opposition group .
westerwelle said the proposals reminded him of a planned economy and had " nothing to do with free competition . "
westerwelle accused the coalition government of using the distraction around the football world cup to " cash up . " industry says health reforms stifle employment big business has argued that the reforms will make it even more expensive to hire new employees .
statutory healthcare costs are currently 14 percent of an employee 's wage , split between worker and employer . the president of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , ludwig georg braun told the daily neuen osnabrücker zeitung on tuesday that the increase in non-wage labor costs means that firms wo n't be able afford to expand their workforce .
he called for set health care contributions independent of wages . the head of the panel of six economic advisors to the government , bert rürup , called the reform a " rather modest compromise based on the lowest common denominator . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics says germany 's health care system is too bureaucratic germany 's 123-year-old public health system is widely criticized for its bloated bureaucracy and lack of transparency . according the organization for economic co-operation and development , germany spends close to 11 percent of its gross domestic product on healthcare , more than france , austria , the netherlands , italy , britain and spain . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government agrees on health , corporate tax reform germany 's ruling coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- said after all-night talks that it had agreed on parts of key reforms to healthcare and corporate taxation .
-lrb- july 3 , 2006 -rrb- german health system not quite in intensive care going by media reports and public opinion in germany , one might think the country 's health care system is sclerotic and near collapse .
but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- vat increase puts germany closer to eu average the 3 percent value-added tax increase that was part of chancellor angela merkel 's election campaign did n't come as a surprise to anyone in germany , but that does n't mean everyone is willing to accept it .

the whole country goes into mourning but dw-world.de believes germany still has plenty to celebrate even though the dream is now over . " we 're going to berlin " the euphoric fans were singing .
even those travelling to fan fests and bars all over germany were singing the refrain ; not a joyous exclamation of their actual destination but a song proclaiming the widely held belief that germany 's destiny was the world cup final in the capital on july 9 . they did get to berlin , on june 30 .
and they won there - beating argentina in a nail-biting , quarter-final climax - but they wo n't be going back to contest the world cup in the final .
germany 's dream of watching their home team raise the golden trophy in triumph ended when italy not only crashed the party but ate all the food , drank all the champagne and went home with the family silver stuffed up their shirts . for this was a smash-and-grab raid of the most heartless kind .
germany - not so much a country in the last few weeks , but a living , breathing unified entity - was ready to follows its team along its pre-destined path to the title and to then fall into a rapture which would quite possibly never end . that was the belief .
the country was riding a wave unlike anything felt in the last 15 years .
it was not only a hope that germany would win but it seemed to be a very poorly kept secret among the white-shirted millions which had turned a recently depressed and morose nation into the world 's biggest festival site .
no one doubted the outcome . klinsi 's kids came from nowhere to bring hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was supposed to be so different it was all very different before the world cup .
jürgen klinsmann 's team was already written-off before the first ball was kicked in anger .
but when the action started , this team of youngsters showed a desire and flair that no-one , not even the most enthusiastic fan , would have expected . but when the players started to deliver in such style , the country started to wonder .
and then they started to hope .
then they started to believe .
it was infectious and the team 's performances seemed to flow with an energy generated from hamburg to munich , from cologne to berlin . this is why the italian victory is such a blow to germany .
any team would be deflated by defeat , leaving the world stage to others who will compete for the trophy they thought they were destined to lift .
a country which wanted a world cup win on home soil so badly can only feel an emotion close to bereavement after such a loss . positive vibe must continue in host nation but while the bubble has so cruelly burst , there are huge positives to take from germany 's world cup experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans should be proud of their team and their world cup as a team , germany actually performed above all expectations and should be honoured and proud of their showing .
they should harness this new attacking flair , nurture it further and come back even stronger , possibly creating a new german legacy of soccer dominance in the future . as a people , the germans should refuse to let such a defeat rob them of their new enthusiasm and to channel the pride in their country and the new respect from outside their borders into a new positive way of living .
they have showed that germany can be an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the germans have consigned many of their stereotypes to a history pre-2006 through welcoming the world and showing it how to party . while the post-match trauma will no doubt lead to a river of tears which will flow through the country , germany must get a grip as soon as possible if this world cup is n't going to deflate entirely .
the germans now have a responsibility to put on their make-up once more , hold the flags proudly aloft again and continue to sing of travelling to berlin .

the whole country goes into mourning but dw-world.de believes germany still has plenty to celebrate even though the dream is now over . " we 're going to berlin " the euphoric fans were singing .
even those travelling to fan fests and bars all over germany were singing the refrain ; not a joyous exclamation of their actual destination but a song proclaiming the widely held belief that germany 's destiny was the world cup final in the capital on july 9 . they did get to berlin , on june 30 .
and they won there - beating argentina in a nail-biting , quarter-final climax - but they wo n't be going back to contest the world cup in the final .
germany 's dream of watching their home team raise the golden trophy in triumph ended when italy not only crashed the party but ate all the food , drank all the champagne and went home with the family silver stuffed up their shirts . for this was a smash-and-grab raid of the most heartless kind .
germany - not so much a country in the last few weeks , but a living , breathing unified entity - was ready to follows its team along its pre-destined path to the title and to then fall into a rapture which would quite possibly never end . that was the belief .
the country was riding a wave unlike anything felt in the last 15 years .
it was not only a hope that germany would win but it seemed to be a very poorly kept secret among the white-shirted millions which had turned a recently depressed and morose nation into the world 's biggest festival site .
no one doubted the outcome . klinsi 's kids came from nowhere to bring hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was supposed to be so different it was all very different before the world cup .
jürgen klinsmann 's team was already written-off before the first ball was kicked in anger .
but when the action started , this team of youngsters showed a desire and flair that no-one , not even the most enthusiastic fan , would have expected . but when the players started to deliver in such style , the country started to wonder .
and then they started to hope .
then they started to believe .
it was infectious and the team 's performances seemed to flow with an energy generated from hamburg to munich , from cologne to berlin . this is why the italian victory is such a blow to germany .
any team would be deflated by defeat , leaving the world stage to others who will compete for the trophy they thought they were destined to lift .
a country which wanted a world cup win on home soil so badly can only feel an emotion close to bereavement after such a loss . positive vibe must continue in host nation but while the bubble has so cruelly burst , there are huge positives to take from germany 's world cup experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans should be proud of their team and their world cup as a team , germany actually performed above all expectations and should be honoured and proud of their showing .
they should harness this new attacking flair , nurture it further and come back even stronger , possibly creating a new german legacy of soccer dominance in the future . as a people , the germans should refuse to let such a defeat rob them of their new enthusiasm and to channel the pride in their country and the new respect from outside their borders into a new positive way of living .
they have showed that germany can be an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the germans have consigned many of their stereotypes to a history pre-2006 through welcoming the world and showing it how to party . while the post-match trauma will no doubt lead to a river of tears which will flow through the country , germany must get a grip as soon as possible if this world cup is n't going to deflate entirely .
the germans now have a responsibility to put on their make-up once more , hold the flags proudly aloft again and continue to sing of travelling to berlin .

german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- has come under fire over a new health reform deal proposed on monday . according to the deal which was hammered out after late-night talks sunday , healthcare contributions paid by employees and their employers will increase from the beginning of next year by around half a percentage point to help close a massive funding gap . in addition , around 1.5 billion in tax revenue will go toward health insurance for children in 2008 and double that amount in 2009 . " this is an important breakthrough we have succeeded in making , " merkel said monday after the late-night huddle . however , a day later finance minister peer steinbrück said the financing plans for children 's healthcare were not yet fixed .
in tuesday 's edition of the handelsblatt daily , steinbrück said " we have not yet agreed to the finance format . " merkel 's health reform thwarts the plan by the spd coalition partners , who had sought an increase in tax to meet the funding shortfall .
merkel rejected the tax hike partly because the electorate already faces a rise in sales tax next year . spd critical of health reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat leader , kurt beck on tuesday , the leader of the spd , kurt beck , told the daily mainzer allgemeinen zeitung he had hoped to be able to lower contributions but that " one has to make compromises in a coalition . "
in the end , " patients would be the winners " of the deal , he said . the reforms drew the ire of guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , the biggest opposition group .
westerwelle said the proposals reminded him of a planned economy and had " nothing to do with free competition . "
westerwelle accused the coalition government of using the distraction around the football world cup to " cash up . " industry says health reforms stifle employment big business has argued that the reforms will make it even more expensive to hire new employees .
statutory healthcare costs are currently 14 percent of an employee 's wage , split between worker and employer . the president of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , ludwig georg braun told the daily neuen osnabrücker zeitung on tuesday that the increase in non-wage labor costs means that firms wo n't be able afford to expand their workforce .
he called for set health care contributions independent of wages . the head of the panel of six economic advisors to the government , bert rürup , called the reform a " rather modest compromise based on the lowest common denominator . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics says germany 's health care system is too bureaucratic germany 's 123-year-old public health system is widely criticized for its bloated bureaucracy and lack of transparency . according the organization for economic co-operation and development , germany spends close to 11 percent of its gross domestic product on healthcare , more than france , austria , the netherlands , italy , britain and spain . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government agrees on health , corporate tax reform germany 's ruling coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- said after all-night talks that it had agreed on parts of key reforms to healthcare and corporate taxation .

the central council of jews in germany has called for the country 's nazi history to be taught as a separate subject .
but teachers ' representatives remain skeptical . charlotte knobloch , the president of the council , said students were taught far too little about the rule of adolf hitler and the holocaust , particularly in the former communist east germany , the online netzeitung reported . " we urgently need to overhaul the way history is taught because far too little attention is paid to national socialism , " knobloch said , adding that the solution would be to devote a course to this chapter of history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch wants to overhaul teaching about the holocaust " it should be made legally binding to do so throughout all of germany 's states , " she added . knobloch , a 73-year-old holocaust survivor , said there were teachers in the former german democratic republic who " hardly know anything about history " .
she added that the system of training school teachers in germany had to be overhauled towards that purpose . teachers dismissive of proposal but knobloch 's comments have met with indignation and skepticism from teachers ' unions as well as the council of regional educational ministries . ute erdsiek , president of the council and education minister of the state of schleswig-holstein told news agency ap that the nazi era and the holocaust were a " mandatory , integral and exhaustive " part of history lessons in all forms of schools in germany .
nazism is also a permanent chapter of the teachers ' training program both in western germany as well as the former communist east germany , erdsiek added . the german teachers ' union described knobloch 's proposals as " wrong and not justified . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students near the holocaust memorial in berlin union president josef kraus said teachers were dedicated to teaching the period between 1933 and 1945 " with the necessary time frame and with necessary discernment . "
" no other era of german history is studied as intensively in german schools as national socialism , " kraus said . new dialogue with jews ? however , erdsiek added that in the face of new political challenges such as the rise of right-wing extremism and increasing multiculturalism in society , the council of regional educational ministries was readily prepared to open a dialogue with the central council of jews about a contemporary and didactic revamping of history lessons about the holocaust . the central council of jews in germany is the highest body representing the country 's 110,000 jews .

the central council of jews in germany has called for the country 's nazi history to be taught as a separate subject .
but teachers ' representatives remain skeptical . charlotte knobloch , the president of the council , said students were taught far too little about the rule of adolf hitler and the holocaust , particularly in the former communist east germany , the online netzeitung reported . " we urgently need to overhaul the way history is taught because far too little attention is paid to national socialism , " knobloch said , adding that the solution would be to devote a course to this chapter of history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch wants to overhaul teaching about the holocaust " it should be made legally binding to do so throughout all of germany 's states , " she added . knobloch , a 73-year-old holocaust survivor , said there were teachers in the former german democratic republic who " hardly know anything about history " .
she added that the system of training school teachers in germany had to be overhauled towards that purpose . teachers dismissive of proposal but knobloch 's comments have met with indignation and skepticism from teachers ' unions as well as the council of regional educational ministries . ute erdsiek , president of the council and education minister of the state of schleswig-holstein told news agency ap that the nazi era and the holocaust were a " mandatory , integral and exhaustive " part of history lessons in all forms of schools in germany .
nazism is also a permanent chapter of the teachers ' training program both in western germany as well as the former communist east germany , erdsiek added . the german teachers ' union described knobloch 's proposals as " wrong and not justified . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students near the holocaust memorial in berlin union president josef kraus said teachers were dedicated to teaching the period between 1933 and 1945 " with the necessary time frame and with necessary discernment . "
" no other era of german history is studied as intensively in german schools as national socialism , " kraus said . new dialogue with jews ? however , erdsiek added that in the face of new political challenges such as the rise of right-wing extremism and increasing multiculturalism in society , the council of regional educational ministries was readily prepared to open a dialogue with the central council of jews about a contemporary and didactic revamping of history lessons about the holocaust . the central council of jews in germany is the highest body representing the country 's 110,000 jews .
knobloch last month became the first woman to head the council . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drawing the unimaginable for many , comics still represent the fantasy realm of mickey mouse and spider-man .

the swiss cabinet in june rejected calls to tighten restrictions on the practice , after concerns that dignitas , an organization which assists with suicides , killed a woman who had simply falsified her medical records to show a terminal illness in order to ' qualify ' for the procedure . switzerland has by far the most liberal law in this respect in europe .

" archbishop doré said the bishops did not support artificially prolonging someone 's life .

" and in this history , it has moments of which it can be proud or ashamed .
to make a selection by thinking only about the proud moments makes this history poorer . "
one violent night on july 4 , 1946 , a rumor began to circulate that a jewish family had kidnapped a christian child and held him in a cellar overnight .
the rumor soon grew and , as rumors do , took on incredible dimensions .
word had it that the small jewish community of kielce needed to have blood transfusions from christians to exist , to make matzos , jewish unleavened bread ; skulls and skeletons were in the cellar of jewish families , due to ritual killings . the father of the missing boy - who was actually sleeping at a friend 's house - asked police to investigate .
the father , neighbors , police and members of the communist militia went to planty street , home to the town 's jews . soon after , a police officer ordered the jews to hand over their weapons , and it was then that the first shots were fired .

the incident was followed by other attacks on jews in the city several days later that killed up to 1,500 jews . and it prompted polish jews - once the largest jewish community in europe numbering 3.5 million before the nazis killed 90 percent of them - to flee in droves after surviving the holocaust : in the three months following the pogrom , around 70,000 jews left poland - more than the 50,000 who had emigrated during the entire year before . " after the kielce pogrom , the situation had inexorably changed , " historian bozena szaynok of wroclaw university told afp .
" right after the war , many jews emigrated to palestine , because they saw poland as a huge cemetery where they could no longer live .
after the pogrom , there was a real atmosphere of panic among jews .
they no longer felt that poland was safe for them . " ripe for violence even though there were other smaller pogroms in hungary and romania , the post-war atmosphere in poland was particularly ripe for the kielce pogrom , historians say .

" the tragic death of polish jews is something that has never been properly mourned here , " jan t. gross , a polish-american author of books on poles and jews told the associated press .

it killed about 40 jews in kielce and led to an exodus of polish jews who survived the holocaust . first came the rumors ; then came the violence .
in the end , 42 people , all but three jewish , were murdered in the polish town of kielce , in what is known as europe 's last pogrom , one year after the surrender of the nazis . for decades , this event in poland 's past lay unexamined by many poles themselves .
but now that is changing as the eu member prepares to unveil a new monument and hold ceremonies marking the day that set off an exodus of jews into exile . " each and every country has its history , " piotr kadlczik , chairman of the union of jewish communities , told polish radio .
" and in this history , it has moments of which it can be proud or ashamed .
to make a selection by thinking only about the proud moments makes this history poorer . "
one violent night on july 4 , 1946 , a rumor began to circulate that a jewish family had kidnapped a christian child and held him in a cellar overnight .
the rumor soon grew and , as rumors do , took on incredible dimensions .
word had it that the small jewish community of kielce needed to have blood transfusions from christians to exist , to make matzos , jewish unleavened bread ; skulls and skeletons were in the cellar of jewish families , due to ritual killings . the father of the missing boy - who was actually sleeping at a friend 's house - asked police to investigate .
the father , neighbors , police and members of the communist militia went to planty street , home to the town 's jews . soon after , a police officer ordered the jews to hand over their weapons , and it was then that the first shots were fired .
no one can say with certainty who opened fire on whom , but the resulting battle with guns and clubs drew in soldiers , the police and civilians , who either shot the jews or beat them to death .
some were thrown out of the windows of apartment blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only about 250,000 polish jews out of 3.5 million survived the holocaust thirty-seven jews and three non-jewish poles were killed that day .
the incident was followed by other attacks on jews in the city several days later that killed up to 1,500 jews . and it prompted polish jews - once the largest jewish community in europe numbering 3.5 million before the nazis killed 90 percent of them - to flee in droves after surviving the holocaust : in the three months following the pogrom , around 70,000 jews left poland - more than the 50,000 who had emigrated during the entire year before . " after the kielce pogrom , the situation had inexorably changed , " historian bozena szaynok of wroclaw university told afp .
" right after the war , many jews emigrated to palestine , because they saw poland as a huge cemetery where they could no longer live .
after the pogrom , there was a real atmosphere of panic among jews .
they no longer felt that poland was safe for them . " ripe for violence even though there were other smaller pogroms in hungary and romania , the post-war atmosphere in poland was particularly ripe for the kielce pogrom , historians say . " the pogrom would never have happened if not for the climate of anti-semitism in poland at the time , where jews were dehumanized , seen as having been ' punished ' in the war , and the myth of the communist jew , who brought the hated communists to power , was freely spread , " historian andrzej paczkowski told afp . " poles feared that jews who survived the war would return and demand that the homes they abandoned when they fled the nazis be returned to them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new polish jewish museum is planned in 2008 for warsaw and even though the polish government apologized for the pogrom 10 years ago , many say that poles still largely see themselves as victims during and after the war and have failed to come to terms with anti-semitism , even today .

the whole country goes into mourning but dw-world.de believes germany still has plenty to celebrate even though the dream is now over . " we 're going to berlin " the euphoric fans were singing .
even those travelling to fan fests and bars all over germany were singing the refrain ; not a joyous exclamation of their actual destination but a song proclaiming the widely held belief that germany 's destiny was the world cup final in the capital on july 9 . they did get to berlin , on june 30 .
and they won there - beating argentina in a nail-biting , quarter-final climax - but they wo n't be going back to contest the world cup in the final .
germany 's dream of watching their home team raise the golden trophy in triumph ended when italy not only crashed the party but ate all the food , drank all the champagne and went home with the family silver stuffed up their shirts . for this was a smash-and-grab raid of the most heartless kind .
germany - not so much a country in the last few weeks , but a living , breathing unified entity - was ready to follows its team along its pre-destined path to the title and to then fall into a rapture which would quite possibly never end . that was the belief .
the country was riding a wave unlike anything felt in the last 15 years .
it was not only a hope that germany would win but it seemed to be a very poorly kept secret among the white-shirted millions which had turned a recently depressed and morose nation into the world 's biggest festival site .

and then they started to hope .
then they started to believe .
it was infectious and the team 's performances seemed to flow with an energy generated from hamburg to munich , from cologne to berlin . this is why the italian victory is such a blow to germany .
any team would be deflated by defeat , leaving the world stage to others who will compete for the trophy they thought they were destined to lift .
a country which wanted a world cup win on home soil so badly can only feel an emotion close to bereavement after such a loss . positive vibe must continue in host nation but while the bubble has so cruelly burst , there are huge positives to take from germany 's world cup experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans should be proud of their team and their world cup as a team , germany actually performed above all expectations and should be honoured and proud of their showing .
they should harness this new attacking flair , nurture it further and come back even stronger , possibly creating a new german legacy of soccer dominance in the future . as a people , the germans should refuse to let such a defeat rob them of their new enthusiasm and to channel the pride in their country and the new respect from outside their borders into a new positive way of living .
they have showed that germany can be an inclusive , friendly and welcoming nation .
the germans have consigned many of their stereotypes to a history pre-2006 through welcoming the world and showing it how to party . while the post-match trauma will no doubt lead to a river of tears which will flow through the country , germany must get a grip as soon as possible if this world cup is n't going to deflate entirely .

" school children also want to see the game , " he said , adding that a penalty shoot-out , such as the one germany needed to beat argentina , could keep kids up long past their bedtime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one last look , then i 'm headed to watch the game soccer mania surpasses car craze some german car companies have also come to terms with the fact that , even in a country as automobile crazy as germany , repair rates for cars made after tuesday 's 9:00 p.m. kick-off could skyrocket as employees ' ability to concentrate on the job plummets when die mannschaft take on the azzurri in dortmund . daimlerchrysler decided to cut one shift from the production schedule in sindelfingen so some 10,000 workers can watch the game .
porsche and bmw are also fiddling with their shifts times to allow staff to clock out in time to catch the game . many deutsche bahn employees , however , will be stuck listening to the radio as the rail company puts about 100 more trains on the tracks to help soccer fans get where they are going , and dortmund airport has registered 107 extra flights with more than 1,500 passengers , many of which are coming from italy , according to airport and border control officials . " everything we have that has wheels on it will be rolling on july 4 , " said hubert jung , head of dortmund 's local transportation authority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's nothing quite like cracking open a can of stadium air !
a breath of sweaty , beery arena air even with the extra transportation , not everyone is going to make it to the city , but a bochum-based company wants to make sure soccer fans still get a whiff of the action . stadionluft has filled 25,000 cans with " original stadium air " from the dortmund grounds and put them on sale for 4.95 euros -lrb- $ 6.34 -rrb- per can for the people who are stuck without a ticket but still want to experience the scent that can comes from a fresh pitch mixed with beer and sausages . regardless of where people watch , the german red cross has three tips for fans watching the games outside : put on sunscreen ; choose sturdy footwear over flip flops ; and drink lots of water instead of alcohol . at least two out of three should n't prove too difficult . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de offsides from the fringe soccer : it 's a funny ol ' game .

" it would be good if the states do not approve more than four sundays a year that stores can stay open , " said merkel . changes ahead the reform package will be voted on july 7 by germany 's upper house of parliament .

german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- has come under fire over a new health reform deal proposed on monday . according to the deal which was hammered out after late-night talks sunday , healthcare contributions paid by employees and their employers will increase from the beginning of next year by around half a percentage point to help close a massive funding gap . in addition , around 1.5 billion in tax revenue will go toward health insurance for children in 2008 and double that amount in 2009 . " this is an important breakthrough we have succeeded in making , " merkel said monday after the late-night huddle . however , a day later finance minister peer steinbrück said the financing plans for children 's healthcare were not yet fixed .
in tuesday 's edition of the handelsblatt daily , steinbrück said " we have not yet agreed to the finance format . " merkel 's health reform thwarts the plan by the spd coalition partners , who had sought an increase in tax to meet the funding shortfall .
merkel rejected the tax hike partly because the electorate already faces a rise in sales tax next year . spd critical of health reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat leader , kurt beck on tuesday , the leader of the spd , kurt beck , told the daily mainzer allgemeinen zeitung he had hoped to be able to lower contributions but that " one has to make compromises in a coalition . "
in the end , " patients would be the winners " of the deal , he said . the reforms drew the ire of guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , the biggest opposition group .
westerwelle said the proposals reminded him of a planned economy and had " nothing to do with free competition . "
westerwelle accused the coalition government of using the distraction around the football world cup to " cash up . " industry says health reforms stifle employment big business has argued that the reforms will make it even more expensive to hire new employees .
statutory healthcare costs are currently 14 percent of an employee 's wage , split between worker and employer . the president of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , ludwig georg braun told the daily neuen osnabrücker zeitung on tuesday that the increase in non-wage labor costs means that firms wo n't be able afford to expand their workforce .
he called for set health care contributions independent of wages . the head of the panel of six economic advisors to the government , bert rürup , called the reform a " rather modest compromise based on the lowest common denominator .

german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- has come under fire over a new health reform deal proposed on monday . according to the deal which was hammered out after late-night talks sunday , healthcare contributions paid by employees and their employers will increase from the beginning of next year by around half a percentage point to help close a massive funding gap . in addition , around 1.5 billion in tax revenue will go toward health insurance for children in 2008 and double that amount in 2009 . " this is an important breakthrough we have succeeded in making , " merkel said monday after the late-night huddle . however , a day later finance minister peer steinbrück said the financing plans for children 's healthcare were not yet fixed .
in tuesday 's edition of the handelsblatt daily , steinbrück said " we have not yet agreed to the finance format . " merkel 's health reform thwarts the plan by the spd coalition partners , who had sought an increase in tax to meet the funding shortfall .
merkel rejected the tax hike partly because the electorate already faces a rise in sales tax next year . spd critical of health reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrat leader , kurt beck on tuesday , the leader of the spd , kurt beck , told the daily mainzer allgemeinen zeitung he had hoped to be able to lower contributions but that " one has to make compromises in a coalition . "
in the end , " patients would be the winners " of the deal , he said . the reforms drew the ire of guido westerwelle , the leader of the free democrats , the biggest opposition group .
westerwelle said the proposals reminded him of a planned economy and had " nothing to do with free competition . "
westerwelle accused the coalition government of using the distraction around the football world cup to " cash up . " industry says health reforms stifle employment big business has argued that the reforms will make it even more expensive to hire new employees .
statutory healthcare costs are currently 14 percent of an employee 's wage , split between worker and employer . the president of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , ludwig georg braun told the daily neuen osnabrücker zeitung on tuesday that the increase in non-wage labor costs means that firms wo n't be able afford to expand their workforce .
he called for set health care contributions independent of wages . the head of the panel of six economic advisors to the government , bert rürup , called the reform a " rather modest compromise based on the lowest common denominator . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics says germany 's health care system is too bureaucratic germany 's 123-year-old public health system is widely criticized for its bloated bureaucracy and lack of transparency . according the organization for economic co-operation and development , germany spends close to 11 percent of its gross domestic product on healthcare , more than france , austria , the netherlands , italy , britain and spain . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government agrees on health , corporate tax reform germany 's ruling coalition of conservatives -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- said after all-night talks that it had agreed on parts of key reforms to healthcare and corporate taxation .

the central council of jews in germany has called for the country 's nazi history to be taught as a separate subject .
but teachers ' representatives remain skeptical . charlotte knobloch , the president of the council , said students were taught far too little about the rule of adolf hitler and the holocaust , particularly in the former communist east germany , the online netzeitung reported . " we urgently need to overhaul the way history is taught because far too little attention is paid to national socialism , " knobloch said , adding that the solution would be to devote a course to this chapter of history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch wants to overhaul teaching about the holocaust " it should be made legally binding to do so throughout all of germany 's states , " she added . knobloch , a 73-year-old holocaust survivor , said there were teachers in the former german democratic republic who " hardly know anything about history " .
she added that the system of training school teachers in germany had to be overhauled towards that purpose . teachers dismissive of proposal but knobloch 's comments have met with indignation and skepticism from teachers ' unions as well as the council of regional educational ministries . ute erdsiek , president of the council and education minister of the state of schleswig-holstein told news agency ap that the nazi era and the holocaust were a " mandatory , integral and exhaustive " part of history lessons in all forms of schools in germany .
nazism is also a permanent chapter of the teachers ' training program both in western germany as well as the former communist east germany , erdsiek added . the german teachers ' union described knobloch 's proposals as " wrong and not justified . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students near the holocaust memorial in berlin union president josef kraus said teachers were dedicated to teaching the period between 1933 and 1945 " with the necessary time frame and with necessary discernment . "
" no other era of german history is studied as intensively in german schools as national socialism , " kraus said . new dialogue with jews ? however , erdsiek added that in the face of new political challenges such as the rise of right-wing extremism and increasing multiculturalism in society , the council of regional educational ministries was readily prepared to open a dialogue with the central council of jews about a contemporary and didactic revamping of history lessons about the holocaust . the central council of jews in germany is the highest body representing the country 's 110,000 jews .

the child exploitation and online protection centre -lrb- ceop -rrb- will run a series of workshops in uk for parents , children and teachers .
ceop said it was concerned that children were posting personal details on so-called community sites .
the body said one in 12 children met up with someone encountered first online .
extremely popular in the uk , social sites such as bebo and myspace have become extremely popular in recent years with each website receiving more than two million visitors every month .
other sites include friendster , facebook , orkut and msn spaces .
have your say " it 's up to parents to ensure that their children use the internet sensibly and there is plenty of software out there to assist " michelle , kent , uk send us your comments jim gamble , chief executive of the ceop centre , told bbc news that the organisation would be talking to parents , children and the industry to ensure the sites were as safe as possible .
he said : " children need to understand the internet has opportunities but with that come negatives .
" do not share information online that you would not share offline .
do not meet someone offline that you met online . "
he said ceop wanted to instil in children and young people a sense of social responsibility when it came to using community sites .
" we will be using the workshops to listen to children to find out how they want to occupy these places safely , " he added .
sites such as myspace let users leave details about their lives online and encourage people to " network " with other users .
typical page a typical page will feature a user 's interests , a list of their favourite music and films , a photo gallery , video clips and a blog .
bebo 's users can also talk to each over a webcam and one newspaper in the uk printed extracts of a conversation in which a young person was encouraged to strip in front of the camera by an anonymous user .
social sites 54 % of bebo uk users are under 18 31 % of myspace uk users are under 18 myspace was bought for £ 308m by news corp myspace and bebo are the fifth and sixth biggest brands online in terms of audience size bebo is opening a london office after an £ 8m investment source : nielsen netratings social sites wrestle for top spot matt colebourne , chief executive of youth community site lunarstorm uk , said his company used computer systems , dedicated security staff and volunteers on the site to watch out for inappropriate behaviour .
he said social networks were popular " because the digital generation has part of its personality online " .
he has invited the industry to set up a safety standards group called the online community special interest group -lrb- oncomm -rrb- .
" the industry has got to decide if it wants to serve adults or children , " he said .
online communities should not be mixing content that is seen by both adults and children , he warned .
in its safety tips section , myspace reminds users that their profiles are public and says not to post information " you would n't want the world to know " .
it also warns that " people are n't always who they say they are " .
bebo tells users they can choose to let only their personal friends see their profile .
the dangers have been highlighted by the head teacher of a kent girl 's school who wrote to parents after realising that 700 of her students had signed up to a networking site .
she considered that some of the images that had been uploaded by the pupils were indecent and could be a lure for paedophiles .
linda wybar , head teacher of tunbridge wells girls ' grammar , also banned the site from her school .
more than half of bebo 's uk audience are under 18 years old , compared with a third of myspace 's users , according to latest net figures .

one year on the couple spoke about their grief , anger and belief their daughter may have lived had the emergency response been different .
" some days you feel okay and others you feel absolutely awful .
" we are not prepared to let go yet .
we neither want to let go of carrie nor let go of trying to get justice for her and everyone else , " says june taylor .
on the first anniversary , they will make their first visit to aldgate station since the london bombings to see a plaque bearing the victims ' names unveiled .
" i 'm not looking forward to that , it 's going to be hard , " said the 58-year-old .
our son was strong for us - he said unless we knew she had gone , then she had n't gone john taylor obituary : carrie taylor as with so many of the bombing victims , that thursday last summer was a routine day for the taylors .
carrie and her mother travelled to london together from their home in billericay , essex , by overland train , as they did every day .

" our son was strong for us ; he said unless we knew she had gone , then she had n't gone . "

events or milestones often take them back to that day , like getting carrie 's handbag back , making the journey to london for the first time , reading of official reports into the bombings , and dealing with media enquiries .

some of the family 's anger is channelled into a campaign to get better compensation for survivors and for a public inquiry into the bombings , and they are in touch with about 15 other affected families .

essex 07:48 - june cherishes the final cctv image of her and carrie her parents , june and john , endured a 10-day wait before dna tests confirmed their daughter was dead .
one year on the couple spoke about their grief , anger and belief their daughter may have lived had the emergency response been different .
" some days you feel okay and others you feel absolutely awful .
" we are not prepared to let go yet .
we neither want to let go of carrie nor let go of trying to get justice for her and everyone else , " says june taylor .
on the first anniversary , they will make their first visit to aldgate station since the london bombings to see a plaque bearing the victims ' names unveiled .
" i 'm not looking forward to that , it 's going to be hard , " said the 58-year-old .
our son was strong for us - he said unless we knew she had gone , then she had n't gone john taylor obituary : carrie taylor as with so many of the bombing victims , that thursday last summer was a routine day for the taylors .
carrie and her mother travelled to london together from their home in billericay , essex , by overland train , as they did every day .
carrie put her make-up on , with june holding her mascara as she applied it with a brush , and they chatted .
when they got to liverpool street , carrie headed for the tube and june walked to work .
" we always used to do the same silly stuff .
carrie would give me a peck on the cheek , and i would give her a pat on the bum .
" i always waited until she was out of sight .
that day she finally gave me a big wave and a grin as if to say : ' off you go , mother . " '
carrie loved to have fun and had lots of friends , said her family the pair usually travelled home together , but that morning june recalls : " she said i should n't wait for her that night , because she was going shopping with her friend . "
the rest of the day is a familiar story of concern , attempts to get in touch , worry then increasing panic , followed by a trawl round hospitals in the hope that carrie was dazed or at worst injured .
" we did n't know where she was .
if she had gone straight to work she would n't have been on the bombed train , but she had mentioned she had to buy something on the way which would have delayed her .
" we spent the first three days hardly eating or going to bed .
i could n't turn the tv off , " says june .
' my heart sank ' john , 57 , who works for security at london 's tate gallery , says their 29-year-old son simon was a tower of strength .
" there 's no way to describe what we went through for those 10 days , " he says .
" our son was strong for us ; he said unless we knew she had gone , then she had n't gone . "
prints and dna swabs were taken from the house by forensics experts , and then the call came from the family 's police liaison officer .
" when they rang and said they wanted to come and speak to us , my heart just sank .
you just knew what they were going to tell you , " june says .
" at first we did n't want to know about what had happened to her , it was bad enough knowing she was n't coming home , " says june .
the family still holidayed together in the usa every year but four months later , a man came forward saying he had cradled a woman he believed to be carrie , who was still alive , for about 30 minutes after the explosion .
june said : " the police came and said he could go but he did n't want to leave her .
the ambulance people arrived and put a drip into her but after four minutes she died . "
the couple say they are angry at the management of the rescue operation - not at the rescuers themselves - for " leaving our daughter down there with those injuries " and believe something could have been done to save her had help arrived sooner .
" we were mortified to hear about this , it threw us right back to 7 july , " says june .
events or milestones often take them back to that day , like getting carrie 's handbag back , making the journey to london for the first time , reading of official reports into the bombings , and dealing with media enquiries .
and not long after the bombings , the police gave the couple a grainy cctv image of june and carrie walking through billericay station an hour before the blasts - a photo june treasures .

simon , who also works at the tate , moved back in with his parents on the day of the bombings and has stayed .
" he needed to be here and we certainly needed him .
we felt stronger as a family , being together . "
june now repeats the morning routine with simon that she did with carrie , with her son disappearing down the same tube entrance every day just as her daughter once did .
" he and carrie were very close .
he used to come home at weekends and they would go to the pictures together .
the day before she died they had lunch in london , " says june .
" he was so strong at first , but in the last three months he has felt like we did last autumn .
the sudden realisation he does n't have his sister any more has hit hard .
he feels solitary now . "

" i find it so hard coming home to an empty house .
carrie and i used to come home together , she would feed the cats and we would start dinner . "
the family always made time to go on holiday together to florida each year .
john said this year 's trip in february was " tough but necessary " .
" if we had n't gone , then the bombers would have won . "
some of the family 's anger is channelled into a campaign to get better compensation for survivors and for a public inquiry into the bombings , and they are in touch with about 15 other affected families .
to some extent , the attacks have made them more political .
" we were very much in favour of the -lrb- defeated proposal to hold terror suspects without charge for -rrb- 90 days and think there is too much political correctness about human rights , " says june .
" after carrie died we were in a void , not knowing where to turn , not knowing why she had to be the one it happened to .

" there 's no way to describe what we went through for those 10 days , " he says .
" our son was strong for us ; he said unless we knew she had gone , then she had n't gone . "
prints and dna swabs were taken from the house by forensics experts , and then the call came from the family 's police liaison officer .
" when they rang and said they wanted to come and speak to us , my heart just sank .
you just knew what they were going to tell you , " june says .
" at first we did n't want to know about what had happened to her , it was bad enough knowing she was n't coming home , " says june .
the family still holidayed together in the usa every year but four months later , a man came forward saying he had cradled a woman he believed to be carrie , who was still alive , for about 30 minutes after the explosion .
june said : " the police came and said he could go but he did n't want to leave her .
the ambulance people arrived and put a drip into her but after four minutes she died . "
the couple say they are angry at the management of the rescue operation - not at the rescuers themselves - for " leaving our daughter down there with those injuries " and believe something could have been done to save her had help arrived sooner .
" we were mortified to hear about this , it threw us right back to 7 july , " says june .
events or milestones often take them back to that day , like getting carrie 's handbag back , making the journey to london for the first time , reading of official reports into the bombings , and dealing with media enquiries .
and not long after the bombings , the police gave the couple a grainy cctv image of june and carrie walking through billericay station an hour before the blasts - a photo june treasures .

simon , who also works at the tate , moved back in with his parents on the day of the bombings and has stayed .
" he needed to be here and we certainly needed him .

june now repeats the morning routine with simon that she did with carrie , with her son disappearing down the same tube entrance every day just as her daughter once did .
" he and carrie were very close .
he used to come home at weekends and they would go to the pictures together .
the day before she died they had lunch in london , " says june .
" he was so strong at first , but in the last three months he has felt like we did last autumn .

the family always made time to go on holiday together to florida each year .
john said this year 's trip in february was " tough but necessary " .
" if we had n't gone , then the bombers would have won . "
some of the family 's anger is channelled into a campaign to get better compensation for survivors and for a public inquiry into the bombings , and they are in touch with about 15 other affected families .
to some extent , the attacks have made them more political .
" we were very much in favour of the -lrb- defeated proposal to hold terror suspects without charge for -rrb- 90 days and think there is too much political correctness about human rights , " says june .

the bank is widely expected to raise rates from zero for the first time in five years at its meeting on 14 july .
on tuesday , japan 's economy minister kaoru yosano appeared to back the rise , but finance minister sadakazu tanigaki said the bank needed to hold fire .
both ministers stressed that the choice was down to the bank , not them .
japan 's monetary policy of zero interest rates was introduced in march 2001 in an attempt to revive the economy , which had been in long-term recession since the early 1990s .
one of the main problems was deflation - falling prices - which meant that consumers and businesses were reluctant to spend or invest because any purchase was likely to be cheaper in the future .
whether it is in july or august , the bank of japan will make its decision kaoru yosano , japanese economy minister the zero interest rate was designed to make it cheaper for consumers and companies to borrow money for spending , and less attractive for them to save .
deflation threat although he did not say that deflation had gone for good , mr yosano said that the conditions for dropping japan 's extreme form of monetary policy were coming into place .
" whether it is in july or august , the bank of japan will make its decision as an independent institution of the nation . "
however , mr tanigaki was much more cautious , and said that the bank of japan needed to keep rates at zero for longer .
" at this juncture , the bank of japan needs to continue its zero-rate policy to support the economy from the monetary side and ensure the economy does not go back into deflation . "
the bank of japan has promised not to raise rates until the threat of deflation has gone and there is strong evidence that retail prices are rising year-on-year .
the bank 's most recent quarterly tankan business confidence survey showed that businesses grew in confidence during the past three months and had big investment plans .
at the end of june government figures showed that prices rose 0.6 % in may compared with the same period in 2005 , the seventh consecutive monthly rise .

one of the main problems was deflation - falling prices - which meant that consumers and businesses were reluctant to spend or invest because any purchase was likely to be cheaper in the future .
whether it is in july or august , the bank of japan will make its decision kaoru yosano , japanese economy minister the zero interest rate was designed to make it cheaper for consumers and companies to borrow money for spending , and less attractive for them to save .
deflation threat although he did not say that deflation had gone for good , mr yosano said that the conditions for dropping japan 's extreme form of monetary policy were coming into place .
" whether it is in july or august , the bank of japan will make its decision as an independent institution of the nation . "
however , mr tanigaki was much more cautious , and said that the bank of japan needed to keep rates at zero for longer .
" at this juncture , the bank of japan needs to continue its zero-rate policy to support the economy from the monetary side and ensure the economy does not go back into deflation . "
the bank of japan has promised not to raise rates until the threat of deflation has gone and there is strong evidence that retail prices are rising year-on-year .
the bank 's most recent quarterly tankan business confidence survey showed that businesses grew in confidence during the past three months and had big investment plans .
at the end of june government figures showed that prices rose 0.6 % in may compared with the same period in 2005 , the seventh consecutive monthly rise .

in a trading update , rank said it had decided to review the potential options for hard rock to assess " if it should remain part of the rank group " .
rank added that its mecca bingo chain had seen revenues hit by the ban on smoking in public places in scotland .
during the 13 weeks since the ban began , rank said that revenue fell 14 % at its 14 mecca clubs in scotland .
the clubs also saw admissions down 6 % and spending per head fall 9 % .
new phase hard rock 's like-for-like revenue - which strips out the impact of new outlets - rose 8 % in the six months to 25 june .
the hard rock brand is seeking to expand in the restaurant , casino and hotel markets , and rank is now looking at whether it would be better to let the business operate independently .
" hard rock has performed strongly as part of the rank group and is now entering a new phase of its development , " rank said .
although rank 's mecca business suffered from the scottish smoking ban , its grosvenor casinos business achieved 8 % growth in revenues .
however , it noted that the number of people coming to the casinos had fallen in recent weeks , as a result of the warmer weather and the beginning of the world cup tournament .
