program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 20.11.2006 german town pins revival hopes on corpse workshop großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' dr. death ' opens a new center to process corpses a struggling eastern german town is now home to the " plastinarium , " a workshop set up by the controversial anatomist behind the " body world " exhibitions , where dissected human corpses were displayed in lifelike poses . anatomist gunther von hagens made a name for himself dissecting corpses , " plastinating " them , and exhibiting them - and their viscera - doing everything from riding a horse to playing chess .
now , in the small town of guben , on the polish border , visitors to von hagens ' latest venture can see a group of corpses playing cards in a scene taken from the newest james bond film , " casino royale . " dubbed dr. death by the newsmagazine der spiegel , von hagens ' " plastinarium , " which opened to the public on friday , is half workshop , half cadaver museum .
to many , it is the height of morbidity .
but to others in the town of guben , where it has opened in a disused wool factory , it might be the ticket to at least a small economic revival after years of decline . guben may achieve renown or notoriety for cadavers in the future .
but to residents , that 's no worse than being known as a one-time industrial center that is now marked by sky-high unemployment and a fast-shrinking population , as young people leave for greener pastures further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say that von hagens is exploiting the dead there , in the four-story renovated factory he bought last year , von hagens will preserve human bodies with polymers , a process he developed and dubbed " plastination . "
thousands of plastinated body parts will then be sold to universities and medical institutes . visitors , meanwhile , can view human cadavers and body parts in various states and poses -lrb- including the bond scene -rrb- as well as study corpses of animals , such as an elephant and a giraffe .
the center 's web site says people will be exposed to the history of anatomical studies , including processes and specimens , such as " bone preparation , vascular casts , body slides , individual organ plastinates as well as whole-body plastinates . " the plastinarium is expected to draw thousands daily , according to van hagens , and provide up to 200 jobs in this town of 23,000 in which every fifth person is unemployed . but that has n't silenced critics who complain that van hagens methods are immoral and unethical .
bodies and commodities dozens turned out for the grand opening thursday to protest the plastinarium , singing " we shall overcome " and some holding placards that condemned the exhibition .
" no economic development with corpses " read one . many of von hagen 's most vocal critics come from within the religious community .
in guben , a pastor , michael domke , has been a particularly vocal critic of van hagens ' center there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal carcasses are included in the new center " this is a place where human body parts are exploited as if they are commodities , " he said .
" von hagens wants to make money by exploiting the dead . " still , many are thrilled that von hagens has made the town his base , saying that the factory he bought sat empty in the years since reunification .
the " plastinator , " as he calls himself , has spent 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.4 million -rrb- renovating the factory . " thousands of people inquired for the 41 jobs we have filled so far .
polls show that 80 percent of guben 's residents are behind this , " he said , referring to a tns emnid poll von hagens ' institute commissioned .
around 78 percent of the 3,000 respondents supported a permanent exhibit of plastinated corpses , against 21 percent who rejected the idea . von hagens said he invited critics to come take a look but they have so far rejected his offer . " i understand why it makes some people uncomfortable , " he added .
" it forces people to confront our own mortality which is not easy . " courting controversy von hagens is no stranger to controversy .
it was during his time as a researcher at the university of heidelberg , in 1977 , that he developed a method of preserving cadavers .
the process replaces body fluids with an odorless , plastic polymer . eventually , von hagens noticed that preserved body parts or even whole bodies might be interesting to the public at large .
he began assembling cadavers in various poses - playing basketball or chess - with organs and muscles visible .
his traveling exhibition , body worlds , inflamed church officials and some municipal authorities where the exhibits were held who called them immoral and disrespectful to the dead . but despite the protests and occasional prayer vigils , almost 20 million viewers have seen his exhibits in germany , belgium , england , switzerland , austria , south korea and the united states since the mid-1990s .
" the goal has always been to use the corpses as an instrument to increase awareness and knowledge of anatomy , " von hagens said . " we are trying to democratize anatomy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory has sat empty for more than a decade but others see money being made off of pure sensationalism that has little to do with science or edification .
" it is one thing to create an exhibit of anatomy to educate the public , " said werner schlaeke , director of the german pathologists association .
" but to pose corpses with cigarettes in their mouth or playing chess is not of educational value - it is entertainment , done for money and publicity and it is shameful . " under fire von hagens has had to also defend his techniques for acquiring cadavers for plastination . in 2001 , he was accused of using a body from a russian prison camp , a charge he denied and was eventually dropped .
two years later , he appeared before the kyrgyzstan parliament to answer charges of obtaining bodies illegally from central asian state hospitals and prisons .
von hagens operates a plastination center both in the kyrgyzstani capital , bishkek , and in china . in 2004 in germany , he faced allegations of tax evasion , falsifying credentials and using the bodies of condemned chinese prisoners without their consent .
he was fined for using the title " professor " but acquitted on all other charges . the bottom line von hagens may come with controversy , but many say that is irrelevant for a town such as guben and its unemployed residents , such as ilona wolfram . a former nurse , wolfram worked in the former textile factory where the plastinarium has been established until it closed in 1991 and has been unemployed ever since .
now she is going back to the factory and to a steady job . " i do n't have a problem with handling body parts of dead people , " she told the berliner zeitung .

but to residents , that 's no worse than being known as a one-time industrial center that is now marked by sky-high unemployment and a fast-shrinking population , as young people leave for greener pastures further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say that von hagens is exploiting the dead there , in the four-story renovated factory he bought last year , von hagens will preserve human bodies with polymers , a process he developed and dubbed " plastination . "
thousands of plastinated body parts will then be sold to universities and medical institutes . visitors , meanwhile , can view human cadavers and body parts in various states and poses -lrb- including the bond scene -rrb- as well as study corpses of animals , such as an elephant and a giraffe .
the center 's web site says people will be exposed to the history of anatomical studies , including processes and specimens , such as " bone preparation , vascular casts , body slides , individual organ plastinates as well as whole-body plastinates . " the plastinarium is expected to draw thousands daily , according to van hagens , and provide up to 200 jobs in this town of 23,000 in which every fifth person is unemployed . but that has n't silenced critics who complain that van hagens methods are immoral and unethical .
bodies and commodities dozens turned out for the grand opening thursday to protest the plastinarium , singing " we shall overcome " and some holding placards that condemned the exhibition .
" no economic development with corpses " read one . many of von hagen 's most vocal critics come from within the religious community .
in guben , a pastor , michael domke , has been a particularly vocal critic of van hagens ' center there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal carcasses are included in the new center " this is a place where human body parts are exploited as if they are commodities , " he said .
" von hagens wants to make money by exploiting the dead . " still , many are thrilled that von hagens has made the town his base , saying that the factory he bought sat empty in the years since reunification .
the " plastinator , " as he calls himself , has spent 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.4 million -rrb- renovating the factory . " thousands of people inquired for the 41 jobs we have filled so far .
polls show that 80 percent of guben 's residents are behind this , " he said , referring to a tns emnid poll von hagens ' institute commissioned .
around 78 percent of the 3,000 respondents supported a permanent exhibit of plastinated corpses , against 21 percent who rejected the idea . von hagens said he invited critics to come take a look but they have so far rejected his offer . " i understand why it makes some people uncomfortable , " he added .
" it forces people to confront our own mortality which is not easy . " courting controversy von hagens is no stranger to controversy .
it was during his time as a researcher at the university of heidelberg , in 1977 , that he developed a method of preserving cadavers .
the process replaces body fluids with an odorless , plastic polymer . eventually , von hagens noticed that preserved body parts or even whole bodies might be interesting to the public at large .
he began assembling cadavers in various poses - playing basketball or chess - with organs and muscles visible .
his traveling exhibition , body worlds , inflamed church officials and some municipal authorities where the exhibits were held who called them immoral and disrespectful to the dead . but despite the protests and occasional prayer vigils , almost 20 million viewers have seen his exhibits in germany , belgium , england , switzerland , austria , south korea and the united states since the mid-1990s .
" the goal has always been to use the corpses as an instrument to increase awareness and knowledge of anatomy , " von hagens said . " we are trying to democratize anatomy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory has sat empty for more than a decade but others see money being made off of pure sensationalism that has little to do with science or edification .
" it is one thing to create an exhibit of anatomy to educate the public , " said werner schlaeke , director of the german pathologists association .
" but to pose corpses with cigarettes in their mouth or playing chess is not of educational value - it is entertainment , done for money and publicity and it is shameful . " under fire von hagens has had to also defend his techniques for acquiring cadavers for plastination . in 2001 , he was accused of using a body from a russian prison camp , a charge he denied and was eventually dropped .
two years later , he appeared before the kyrgyzstan parliament to answer charges of obtaining bodies illegally from central asian state hospitals and prisons .
von hagens operates a plastination center both in the kyrgyzstani capital , bishkek , and in china . in 2004 in germany , he faced allegations of tax evasion , falsifying credentials and using the bodies of condemned chinese prisoners without their consent .
he was fined for using the title " professor " but acquitted on all other charges . the bottom line von hagens may come with controversy , but many say that is irrelevant for a town such as guben and its unemployed residents , such as ilona wolfram . a former nurse , wolfram worked in the former textile factory where the plastinarium has been established until it closed in 1991 and has been unemployed ever since .

now , in the small town of guben , on the polish border , visitors to von hagens ' latest venture can see a group of corpses playing cards in a scene taken from the newest james bond film , " casino royale . " dubbed dr. death by the newsmagazine der spiegel , von hagens ' " plastinarium , " which opened to the public on friday , is half workshop , half cadaver museum .
to many , it is the height of morbidity .
but to others in the town of guben , where it has opened in a disused wool factory , it might be the ticket to at least a small economic revival after years of decline . guben may achieve renown or notoriety for cadavers in the future .
but to residents , that 's no worse than being known as a one-time industrial center that is now marked by sky-high unemployment and a fast-shrinking population , as young people leave for greener pastures further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say that von hagens is exploiting the dead there , in the four-story renovated factory he bought last year , von hagens will preserve human bodies with polymers , a process he developed and dubbed " plastination . "
thousands of plastinated body parts will then be sold to universities and medical institutes . visitors , meanwhile , can view human cadavers and body parts in various states and poses -lrb- including the bond scene -rrb- as well as study corpses of animals , such as an elephant and a giraffe .
the center 's web site says people will be exposed to the history of anatomical studies , including processes and specimens , such as " bone preparation , vascular casts , body slides , individual organ plastinates as well as whole-body plastinates . " the plastinarium is expected to draw thousands daily , according to van hagens , and provide up to 200 jobs in this town of 23,000 in which every fifth person is unemployed . but that has n't silenced critics who complain that van hagens methods are immoral and unethical .
bodies and commodities dozens turned out for the grand opening thursday to protest the plastinarium , singing " we shall overcome " and some holding placards that condemned the exhibition .
" no economic development with corpses " read one . many of von hagen 's most vocal critics come from within the religious community .
in guben , a pastor , michael domke , has been a particularly vocal critic of van hagens ' center there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal carcasses are included in the new center " this is a place where human body parts are exploited as if they are commodities , " he said .
" von hagens wants to make money by exploiting the dead . " still , many are thrilled that von hagens has made the town his base , saying that the factory he bought sat empty in the years since reunification .
the " plastinator , " as he calls himself , has spent 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.4 million -rrb- renovating the factory . " thousands of people inquired for the 41 jobs we have filled so far .
polls show that 80 percent of guben 's residents are behind this , " he said , referring to a tns emnid poll von hagens ' institute commissioned .
around 78 percent of the 3,000 respondents supported a permanent exhibit of plastinated corpses , against 21 percent who rejected the idea . von hagens said he invited critics to come take a look but they have so far rejected his offer . " i understand why it makes some people uncomfortable , " he added .
" it forces people to confront our own mortality which is not easy . " courting controversy von hagens is no stranger to controversy .
it was during his time as a researcher at the university of heidelberg , in 1977 , that he developed a method of preserving cadavers .
the process replaces body fluids with an odorless , plastic polymer . eventually , von hagens noticed that preserved body parts or even whole bodies might be interesting to the public at large .
he began assembling cadavers in various poses - playing basketball or chess - with organs and muscles visible .
his traveling exhibition , body worlds , inflamed church officials and some municipal authorities where the exhibits were held who called them immoral and disrespectful to the dead . but despite the protests and occasional prayer vigils , almost 20 million viewers have seen his exhibits in germany , belgium , england , switzerland , austria , south korea and the united states since the mid-1990s .

there are some difficult culinary decisions facing pampered pooches in germany . dogs in wiesbaden - one of germany 's most affluent cities - have a tough life .
first , there is the arduous stroll through the haute couture stores in the luxurious wilhelmstrasse .
then there is the patient wait while owners take a flutter at the casino or a dip in the thermal springs . but , fortunately , the poor pooches have some compensation - their very own bakery offering a choice of tuna cookies , love bones , vitality bars and other tasty creations for the affluent , urban dog . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesbaden is famous for its thermal baths a former florist , janine saraniti-lagerin , set up her " dog 's goodies " bakery for canine customers three months ago after being inspired by a television report about similar us shops . in a stylish city where it just would n't do to be seen with a chubby canine , the tidbits on sale are , of course , non-fattening and sugar free .

" " germany is unreservedly committed to its moral obligation to restore art seized by the nazis , " he added .
" there will be no watering down of this obligation . " no concrete decisions were made concerning how the restitution could take place , said government spokesperson thomas steg , adding that the gathering served as a forum to exchange ideas and information . germany sees a particular moral responsibility in the matter , steg said . kirchner 's 1913 oil had belonged to the jewish art collector alfred hess before it was acquired by the nazis .
it later made its way to berlin 's brücke museum , which returned the work to hess ' heirs , who in turn auctioned it at tiffany 's . request for more art research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : works by franz marc are also subject to restitution from 1933 , nazi officials ruthlessly plundered the art collections of jewish families and experts estimate that there are some 100,000 works worldwide that have still not been returned to their rightful heirs .
more than a dozen art institutions are affected , according to some estimates . monday 's meeting heard that 1,000 german museums and galleries are bracing for restitution claims .
there are claims in the pipeline for some 100 works from the expressionist period alone . one approach is to develop a special restitution fund that would put museums in the financial position to be able to buy back restituted works , steg said . martin roth , general director of the state art collection in dresden appealed for greater investment in provenance research , which traces the origins of a work of art . " it has to be made clear to those in charge that -lrb- provenance research -rrb- ca n't just be done on the side , " said roth .
" it is criminology paired with a lot of technical knowledge . " since 1991 , the state art collection in dresden has returned over 800 objects and works of art , said the general director . second round-table planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neumann said the restitution business is highly commercialized roth has also advocated finding a european , and not purely german , solution to the matter . neumann highlighted moral responsibility and the need for transparency in restitution deals .
he said museums are complaining that the restitution business has become extremely commercialized . a second restitution summit is in the works , according to german news agency dpa .
a date has not yet been set , but it is to include organizations representing victims of nazi persecution . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany aims for better restitution process for nazi-looted art the german government has invited museum directors and legal experts to berlin on monday to discuss claims for art bought or seized by the nazis .

dw.world.de spoke with the council president lutz tillmanns . the german press council sets its goal as overseeing that journalists report accurately and working to stop discrimination and slander as well as preventing the press from using dishonest research methods .
the council , however , does not have the authority to impose sanctions and can only give out warnings and reprimands . the german press council started life in bonn in 1956 when a group of five publishers and five journalists were sitting around a pub table .
they wanted to make a stand against the federal press law .
at the time , the interior minister was planning to establish a federal press watchdog .
instead , the journalists and publishers set up their own . dw.world.de : what does the german press council do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council was founded by journalists and publishers in 1956 we defend press freedom , for example when official inquiries impact journalistic content .
we become involved when editorial offices are searched or when material is confiscated . we also become involved when there are issues such as journalists showing bias towards a particular brand or company in their work , in a deceptive and sneaky way .
or when it comes to questions of journalistic dependence , such as how far can a journalist 's relationship go .
or what are the problems concerning the protection of victims in the media .
in addition , we also work through between 600 and 800 individual complaints per year regarding individual articles . what are the issues surrounding press freedom in germany ?
does freedom of the press need to be protected in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press council in 2006 - struggles for press freedom are still continuing today press freedom and freedom of expression are enshrined in germany 's constitution , but still there are some questions that need to be resolved : how do journalists receive access to information ; who is obligated , in the government departments , to give out this information .
other issues include what happens when i receive information and want to protect my source , but the police or state prosecutors does n't consider that , what happens to press freedom then ? it is not uncommon that a journalist 's work is confiscated , and legal authorities try to find out the source or materials to then use this information in order to prosecute the case . these are points where press freedom is really pushed to the limit , and that 's when fine-tuning becomes necessary . why does the press council operate under voluntary controls , and not state control ? it would be counter-productive if we would provoke the state to tighten laws against the media .
the existence of the press council over the last 50 years has shown that the german federal government and states are very careful about the regulation of the press through laws .
i think it is right that the industry recognizes for itself that it has to work for its privileges and has to be responsible .
that is why is should be voluntary , because then there is no obligation to the state , and with the voluntary system we have greater recognition of our role . but what about with tabloid papers , such as the bild , what can an official reprimand really mean to such a media giant ? even the bild and its current editor-in-chief are annoyed when other media report that bild has been reprimanded .
they also have to print the reprimands in the paper themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild has been repremanded on various occassions complaint investigations several times a year also use considerable resources .
this means the editor-in-chief and the legal department and other departments have to address the issue .
if they could avoid complaints investigations by the press council , then they would surely do so . does the press council need to be able to give out stronger punishments ? i believe that we do n't need other punishments ; we need more effective self-control perhaps with more publicity , that we receive more response from the press .
the german president emphasized that in his speech today . what are the press council 's struggles for the future ? we will certainly be looking at the grey zone between journalism and pr .
we do that already , but we need to increase our efforts here .
the electronic press is also very important - the recognition that the code of ethics is valid for electronic press as well as printed press - that is the information that is professionally published in the internet . also the defense of freedom of the press .
when i think of how many editorial departments have been searched , how much material has been confiscated , such as at cicero magazine , or dresden 's morgenpost .
journalists have been listened to on the telephone .
there are continual injuries of the press freedom .
we have to stay on the ball and push for better regulations . kate hairsine interviewed lutz tillmanns -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reporters without borders fights censorship with online demo the international human rights organization reporters without borders is sponsoring a 24-hour cyber demonstration against internet censorship , starting tuesday , nov .

dw.world.de spoke with the council president lutz tillmanns . the german press council sets its goal as overseeing that journalists report accurately and working to stop discrimination and slander as well as preventing the press from using dishonest research methods .
the council , however , does not have the authority to impose sanctions and can only give out warnings and reprimands . the german press council started life in bonn in 1956 when a group of five publishers and five journalists were sitting around a pub table .
they wanted to make a stand against the federal press law .
at the time , the interior minister was planning to establish a federal press watchdog .
instead , the journalists and publishers set up their own . dw.world.de : what does the german press council do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council was founded by journalists and publishers in 1956 we defend press freedom , for example when official inquiries impact journalistic content .
we become involved when editorial offices are searched or when material is confiscated . we also become involved when there are issues such as journalists showing bias towards a particular brand or company in their work , in a deceptive and sneaky way .
or when it comes to questions of journalistic dependence , such as how far can a journalist 's relationship go .
or what are the problems concerning the protection of victims in the media .
in addition , we also work through between 600 and 800 individual complaints per year regarding individual articles . what are the issues surrounding press freedom in germany ?
does freedom of the press need to be protected in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press council in 2006 - struggles for press freedom are still continuing today press freedom and freedom of expression are enshrined in germany 's constitution , but still there are some questions that need to be resolved : how do journalists receive access to information ; who is obligated , in the government departments , to give out this information .
other issues include what happens when i receive information and want to protect my source , but the police or state prosecutors does n't consider that , what happens to press freedom then ? it is not uncommon that a journalist 's work is confiscated , and legal authorities try to find out the source or materials to then use this information in order to prosecute the case . these are points where press freedom is really pushed to the limit , and that 's when fine-tuning becomes necessary . why does the press council operate under voluntary controls , and not state control ? it would be counter-productive if we would provoke the state to tighten laws against the media .
the existence of the press council over the last 50 years has shown that the german federal government and states are very careful about the regulation of the press through laws .
i think it is right that the industry recognizes for itself that it has to work for its privileges and has to be responsible .
that is why is should be voluntary , because then there is no obligation to the state , and with the voluntary system we have greater recognition of our role . but what about with tabloid papers , such as the bild , what can an official reprimand really mean to such a media giant ? even the bild and its current editor-in-chief are annoyed when other media report that bild has been reprimanded .
they also have to print the reprimands in the paper themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild has been repremanded on various occassions complaint investigations several times a year also use considerable resources .
this means the editor-in-chief and the legal department and other departments have to address the issue .
if they could avoid complaints investigations by the press council , then they would surely do so . does the press council need to be able to give out stronger punishments ? i believe that we do n't need other punishments ; we need more effective self-control perhaps with more publicity , that we receive more response from the press .
the german president emphasized that in his speech today . what are the press council 's struggles for the future ? we will certainly be looking at the grey zone between journalism and pr .
we do that already , but we need to increase our efforts here .

the unnamed official said allied commanders should be able to call the germans in the morning , asking for a battalion , and it should be there by the evening . he said washington was frustrated by the mandate restrictions which were confining several foreign armies to the sidelines of conflicts in southern afghanistan . us unhappy with obstacles the us defense official was quoted in reports as saying that he did not like these stumbling blocks and that such a restrictive policy showed no solidarity with those western troops fighting the taliban in the south of the country . at present , there are some 2,700 german troops in the north of afghanistan where they hold the command of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- contingent . however , us and some european nato member countries feel german troops should also be deployed in the more dangerous southern parts of afghanistan .

" we have a large contingent on the balkans , we 're part of the unifil mission in lebanon , and german troops are also at the horn of africa to prevent the smuggling of weapons by sea to terrorists , " schulz said .

the unnamed official said allied commanders should be able to call the germans in the morning , asking for a battalion , and it should be there by the evening . he said washington was frustrated by the mandate restrictions which were confining several foreign armies to the sidelines of conflicts in southern afghanistan . us unhappy with obstacles the us defense official was quoted in reports as saying that he did not like these stumbling blocks and that such a restrictive policy showed no solidarity with those western troops fighting the taliban in the south of the country . at present , there are some 2,700 german troops in the north of afghanistan where they hold the command of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- contingent . however , us and some european nato member countries feel german troops should also be deployed in the more dangerous southern parts of afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato-led isaf troops are under german control in northern afghanistan ' germany has played a big part already ' martin schulz , leader of the social democrats in the european parliament , rejected the us criticism which had also been echoed more recently by nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . schulz insisted german troops have been doing a great job in the north , where they have played a significant role in reconstruction efforts and contributing to resolving the conflicts , and this is where they should stay . he added that german has been active in " many peace-keeping missions abroad , " and resources can only go so far . " we have a large contingent on the balkans , we 're part of the unifil mission in lebanon , and german troops are also at the horn of africa to prevent the smuggling of weapons by sea to terrorists , " schulz said .
" it 's justified to say that the german armed forces are taxed to their limits , and any criticism of their commitment in afghanistan is unfounded . " miliary efforts " not enough " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz says german troops have effectively continued to stabilize northern afganistan schulz admitted the situation in the south of the country was bordering on chaos but said military operations alone would not resolve the problem . " perhaps more troops are needed to fight the taliban in the south , but the karsai government is also called upon to ensure that the resources being pumped into the country do not end up in the pockets of warlords and are distributed more evenly , " schulz said . " what sense would it make to withdraw some of our northern troops who 've done a great job there , and deploy them in the south ?
this would only result in a partial destabilization in the north so that nothing would be gained by such a move , " he added . the us state department meanwhile has confirmed president george w. bush has raised the issue with german chancellor angela merkel . german defense minister franz josef jung said there will not be any change to germany 's afghanistan mandate . southern troop deployment a possibility but reacting to the pressure from washington , other conservative lawmakers have indicated a partial deployment of german troops in the south of afghanistan is no longer out of the question .
they have said that if the capabilities of the german troops are needed to rescue friendly forces in emergency situations in the south , then they should be dispatched there . eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's christian democrats , said up to 100 special forces soldiers could be deployed anywhere in the country at any given time but added this had not been requested for over a year . germany 's commitment to the afghanistan mission will be discussed at the nato summit in riga , latvia , on nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 20.11.2006 german press council celebrates 50 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press council members spend more time behind the microsphones than in front of them monday is the 50th anniversary of the german press council , an independent and self-regulating organization which was based on the british press council model .
dw.world.de spoke with the council president lutz tillmanns . the german press council sets its goal as overseeing that journalists report accurately and working to stop discrimination and slander as well as preventing the press from using dishonest research methods .
the council , however , does not have the authority to impose sanctions and can only give out warnings and reprimands . the german press council started life in bonn in 1956 when a group of five publishers and five journalists were sitting around a pub table .
they wanted to make a stand against the federal press law .
at the time , the interior minister was planning to establish a federal press watchdog .
instead , the journalists and publishers set up their own . dw.world.de : what does the german press council do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council was founded by journalists and publishers in 1956 we defend press freedom , for example when official inquiries impact journalistic content .
we become involved when editorial offices are searched or when material is confiscated . we also become involved when there are issues such as journalists showing bias towards a particular brand or company in their work , in a deceptive and sneaky way .
or when it comes to questions of journalistic dependence , such as how far can a journalist 's relationship go .
or what are the problems concerning the protection of victims in the media .
in addition , we also work through between 600 and 800 individual complaints per year regarding individual articles . what are the issues surrounding press freedom in germany ?
does freedom of the press need to be protected in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press council in 2006 - struggles for press freedom are still continuing today press freedom and freedom of expression are enshrined in germany 's constitution , but still there are some questions that need to be resolved : how do journalists receive access to information ; who is obligated , in the government departments , to give out this information .
other issues include what happens when i receive information and want to protect my source , but the police or state prosecutors does n't consider that , what happens to press freedom then ? it is not uncommon that a journalist 's work is confiscated , and legal authorities try to find out the source or materials to then use this information in order to prosecute the case . these are points where press freedom is really pushed to the limit , and that 's when fine-tuning becomes necessary . why does the press council operate under voluntary controls , and not state control ? it would be counter-productive if we would provoke the state to tighten laws against the media .
the existence of the press council over the last 50 years has shown that the german federal government and states are very careful about the regulation of the press through laws .
i think it is right that the industry recognizes for itself that it has to work for its privileges and has to be responsible .
that is why is should be voluntary , because then there is no obligation to the state , and with the voluntary system we have greater recognition of our role . but what about with tabloid papers , such as the bild , what can an official reprimand really mean to such a media giant ? even the bild and its current editor-in-chief are annoyed when other media report that bild has been reprimanded .
they also have to print the reprimands in the paper themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild has been repremanded on various occassions complaint investigations several times a year also use considerable resources .
this means the editor-in-chief and the legal department and other departments have to address the issue .
if they could avoid complaints investigations by the press council , then they would surely do so . does the press council need to be able to give out stronger punishments ? i believe that we do n't need other punishments ; we need more effective self-control perhaps with more publicity , that we receive more response from the press .
the german president emphasized that in his speech today . what are the press council 's struggles for the future ? we will certainly be looking at the grey zone between journalism and pr .
we do that already , but we need to increase our efforts here .
the electronic press is also very important - the recognition that the code of ethics is valid for electronic press as well as printed press - that is the information that is professionally published in the internet . also the defense of freedom of the press .
when i think of how many editorial departments have been searched , how much material has been confiscated , such as at cicero magazine , or dresden 's morgenpost .
journalists have been listened to on the telephone .
there are continual injuries of the press freedom .

dw.world.de spoke with the council president lutz tillmanns . the german press council sets its goal as overseeing that journalists report accurately and working to stop discrimination and slander as well as preventing the press from using dishonest research methods .
the council , however , does not have the authority to impose sanctions and can only give out warnings and reprimands . the german press council started life in bonn in 1956 when a group of five publishers and five journalists were sitting around a pub table .
they wanted to make a stand against the federal press law .
at the time , the interior minister was planning to establish a federal press watchdog .
instead , the journalists and publishers set up their own . dw.world.de : what does the german press council do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council was founded by journalists and publishers in 1956 we defend press freedom , for example when official inquiries impact journalistic content .
we become involved when editorial offices are searched or when material is confiscated . we also become involved when there are issues such as journalists showing bias towards a particular brand or company in their work , in a deceptive and sneaky way .
or when it comes to questions of journalistic dependence , such as how far can a journalist 's relationship go .
or what are the problems concerning the protection of victims in the media .
in addition , we also work through between 600 and 800 individual complaints per year regarding individual articles . what are the issues surrounding press freedom in germany ?
does freedom of the press need to be protected in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press council in 2006 - struggles for press freedom are still continuing today press freedom and freedom of expression are enshrined in germany 's constitution , but still there are some questions that need to be resolved : how do journalists receive access to information ; who is obligated , in the government departments , to give out this information .
other issues include what happens when i receive information and want to protect my source , but the police or state prosecutors does n't consider that , what happens to press freedom then ? it is not uncommon that a journalist 's work is confiscated , and legal authorities try to find out the source or materials to then use this information in order to prosecute the case . these are points where press freedom is really pushed to the limit , and that 's when fine-tuning becomes necessary . why does the press council operate under voluntary controls , and not state control ? it would be counter-productive if we would provoke the state to tighten laws against the media .
the existence of the press council over the last 50 years has shown that the german federal government and states are very careful about the regulation of the press through laws .
i think it is right that the industry recognizes for itself that it has to work for its privileges and has to be responsible .
that is why is should be voluntary , because then there is no obligation to the state , and with the voluntary system we have greater recognition of our role . but what about with tabloid papers , such as the bild , what can an official reprimand really mean to such a media giant ? even the bild and its current editor-in-chief are annoyed when other media report that bild has been reprimanded .
they also have to print the reprimands in the paper themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild has been repremanded on various occassions complaint investigations several times a year also use considerable resources .
this means the editor-in-chief and the legal department and other departments have to address the issue .
if they could avoid complaints investigations by the press council , then they would surely do so . does the press council need to be able to give out stronger punishments ? i believe that we do n't need other punishments ; we need more effective self-control perhaps with more publicity , that we receive more response from the press .
the german president emphasized that in his speech today . what are the press council 's struggles for the future ? we will certainly be looking at the grey zone between journalism and pr .
we do that already , but we need to increase our efforts here .
the electronic press is also very important - the recognition that the code of ethics is valid for electronic press as well as printed press - that is the information that is professionally published in the internet . also the defense of freedom of the press .
when i think of how many editorial departments have been searched , how much material has been confiscated , such as at cicero magazine , or dresden 's morgenpost .
journalists have been listened to on the telephone .
there are continual injuries of the press freedom .
we have to stay on the ball and push for better regulations . kate hairsine interviewed lutz tillmanns -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reporters without borders fights censorship with online demo the international human rights organization reporters without borders is sponsoring a 24-hour cyber demonstration against internet censorship , starting tuesday , nov .

dw.world.de spoke with the council president lutz tillmanns . the german press council sets its goal as overseeing that journalists report accurately and working to stop discrimination and slander as well as preventing the press from using dishonest research methods .
the council , however , does not have the authority to impose sanctions and can only give out warnings and reprimands . the german press council started life in bonn in 1956 when a group of five publishers and five journalists were sitting around a pub table .
they wanted to make a stand against the federal press law .
at the time , the interior minister was planning to establish a federal press watchdog .
instead , the journalists and publishers set up their own . dw.world.de : what does the german press council do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council was founded by journalists and publishers in 1956 we defend press freedom , for example when official inquiries impact journalistic content .
we become involved when editorial offices are searched or when material is confiscated . we also become involved when there are issues such as journalists showing bias towards a particular brand or company in their work , in a deceptive and sneaky way .
or when it comes to questions of journalistic dependence , such as how far can a journalist 's relationship go .
or what are the problems concerning the protection of victims in the media .
in addition , we also work through between 600 and 800 individual complaints per year regarding individual articles . what are the issues surrounding press freedom in germany ?
does freedom of the press need to be protected in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press council in 2006 - struggles for press freedom are still continuing today press freedom and freedom of expression are enshrined in germany 's constitution , but still there are some questions that need to be resolved : how do journalists receive access to information ; who is obligated , in the government departments , to give out this information .
other issues include what happens when i receive information and want to protect my source , but the police or state prosecutors does n't consider that , what happens to press freedom then ? it is not uncommon that a journalist 's work is confiscated , and legal authorities try to find out the source or materials to then use this information in order to prosecute the case . these are points where press freedom is really pushed to the limit , and that 's when fine-tuning becomes necessary . why does the press council operate under voluntary controls , and not state control ? it would be counter-productive if we would provoke the state to tighten laws against the media .
the existence of the press council over the last 50 years has shown that the german federal government and states are very careful about the regulation of the press through laws .
i think it is right that the industry recognizes for itself that it has to work for its privileges and has to be responsible .
that is why is should be voluntary , because then there is no obligation to the state , and with the voluntary system we have greater recognition of our role . but what about with tabloid papers , such as the bild , what can an official reprimand really mean to such a media giant ? even the bild and its current editor-in-chief are annoyed when other media report that bild has been reprimanded .
they also have to print the reprimands in the paper themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild has been repremanded on various occassions complaint investigations several times a year also use considerable resources .
this means the editor-in-chief and the legal department and other departments have to address the issue .
if they could avoid complaints investigations by the press council , then they would surely do so . does the press council need to be able to give out stronger punishments ? i believe that we do n't need other punishments ; we need more effective self-control perhaps with more publicity , that we receive more response from the press .
the german president emphasized that in his speech today . what are the press council 's struggles for the future ? we will certainly be looking at the grey zone between journalism and pr .
we do that already , but we need to increase our efforts here .
the electronic press is also very important - the recognition that the code of ethics is valid for electronic press as well as printed press - that is the information that is professionally published in the internet . also the defense of freedom of the press .
when i think of how many editorial departments have been searched , how much material has been confiscated , such as at cicero magazine , or dresden 's morgenpost .
journalists have been listened to on the telephone .
there are continual injuries of the press freedom .
we have to stay on the ball and push for better regulations . kate hairsine interviewed lutz tillmanns -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reporters without borders fights censorship with online demo the international human rights organization reporters without borders is sponsoring a 24-hour cyber demonstration against internet censorship , starting tuesday , nov .

now , in the small town of guben , on the polish border , visitors to von hagens ' latest venture can see a group of corpses playing cards in a scene taken from the newest james bond film , " casino royale . " dubbed dr. death by the newsmagazine der spiegel , von hagens ' " plastinarium , " which opened to the public on friday , is half workshop , half cadaver museum .
to many , it is the height of morbidity .
but to others in the town of guben , where it has opened in a disused wool factory , it might be the ticket to at least a small economic revival after years of decline . guben may achieve renown or notoriety for cadavers in the future .
but to residents , that 's no worse than being known as a one-time industrial center that is now marked by sky-high unemployment and a fast-shrinking population , as young people leave for greener pastures further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say that von hagens is exploiting the dead there , in the four-story renovated factory he bought last year , von hagens will preserve human bodies with polymers , a process he developed and dubbed " plastination . "
thousands of plastinated body parts will then be sold to universities and medical institutes . visitors , meanwhile , can view human cadavers and body parts in various states and poses -lrb- including the bond scene -rrb- as well as study corpses of animals , such as an elephant and a giraffe .
the center 's web site says people will be exposed to the history of anatomical studies , including processes and specimens , such as " bone preparation , vascular casts , body slides , individual organ plastinates as well as whole-body plastinates . " the plastinarium is expected to draw thousands daily , according to van hagens , and provide up to 200 jobs in this town of 23,000 in which every fifth person is unemployed . but that has n't silenced critics who complain that van hagens methods are immoral and unethical .
bodies and commodities dozens turned out for the grand opening thursday to protest the plastinarium , singing " we shall overcome " and some holding placards that condemned the exhibition .
" no economic development with corpses " read one . many of von hagen 's most vocal critics come from within the religious community .
in guben , a pastor , michael domke , has been a particularly vocal critic of van hagens ' center there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal carcasses are included in the new center " this is a place where human body parts are exploited as if they are commodities , " he said .
" von hagens wants to make money by exploiting the dead . " still , many are thrilled that von hagens has made the town his base , saying that the factory he bought sat empty in the years since reunification .
the " plastinator , " as he calls himself , has spent 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.4 million -rrb- renovating the factory . " thousands of people inquired for the 41 jobs we have filled so far .
polls show that 80 percent of guben 's residents are behind this , " he said , referring to a tns emnid poll von hagens ' institute commissioned .
around 78 percent of the 3,000 respondents supported a permanent exhibit of plastinated corpses , against 21 percent who rejected the idea . von hagens said he invited critics to come take a look but they have so far rejected his offer . " i understand why it makes some people uncomfortable , " he added .
" it forces people to confront our own mortality which is not easy . " courting controversy von hagens is no stranger to controversy .
it was during his time as a researcher at the university of heidelberg , in 1977 , that he developed a method of preserving cadavers .
the process replaces body fluids with an odorless , plastic polymer . eventually , von hagens noticed that preserved body parts or even whole bodies might be interesting to the public at large .
he began assembling cadavers in various poses - playing basketball or chess - with organs and muscles visible .
his traveling exhibition , body worlds , inflamed church officials and some municipal authorities where the exhibits were held who called them immoral and disrespectful to the dead . but despite the protests and occasional prayer vigils , almost 20 million viewers have seen his exhibits in germany , belgium , england , switzerland , austria , south korea and the united states since the mid-1990s .
" the goal has always been to use the corpses as an instrument to increase awareness and knowledge of anatomy , " von hagens said . " we are trying to democratize anatomy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory has sat empty for more than a decade but others see money being made off of pure sensationalism that has little to do with science or edification .
" it is one thing to create an exhibit of anatomy to educate the public , " said werner schlaeke , director of the german pathologists association .
" but to pose corpses with cigarettes in their mouth or playing chess is not of educational value - it is entertainment , done for money and publicity and it is shameful . " under fire von hagens has had to also defend his techniques for acquiring cadavers for plastination . in 2001 , he was accused of using a body from a russian prison camp , a charge he denied and was eventually dropped .
two years later , he appeared before the kyrgyzstan parliament to answer charges of obtaining bodies illegally from central asian state hospitals and prisons .
von hagens operates a plastination center both in the kyrgyzstani capital , bishkek , and in china . in 2004 in germany , he faced allegations of tax evasion , falsifying credentials and using the bodies of condemned chinese prisoners without their consent .
he was fined for using the title " professor " but acquitted on all other charges . the bottom line von hagens may come with controversy , but many say that is irrelevant for a town such as guben and its unemployed residents , such as ilona wolfram . a former nurse , wolfram worked in the former textile factory where the plastinarium has been established until it closed in 1991 and has been unemployed ever since .

now , in the small town of guben , on the polish border , visitors to von hagens ' latest venture can see a group of corpses playing cards in a scene taken from the newest james bond film , " casino royale . " dubbed dr. death by the newsmagazine der spiegel , von hagens ' " plastinarium , " which opened to the public on friday , is half workshop , half cadaver museum .
to many , it is the height of morbidity .
but to others in the town of guben , where it has opened in a disused wool factory , it might be the ticket to at least a small economic revival after years of decline . guben may achieve renown or notoriety for cadavers in the future .
but to residents , that 's no worse than being known as a one-time industrial center that is now marked by sky-high unemployment and a fast-shrinking population , as young people leave for greener pastures further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say that von hagens is exploiting the dead there , in the four-story renovated factory he bought last year , von hagens will preserve human bodies with polymers , a process he developed and dubbed " plastination . "
thousands of plastinated body parts will then be sold to universities and medical institutes . visitors , meanwhile , can view human cadavers and body parts in various states and poses -lrb- including the bond scene -rrb- as well as study corpses of animals , such as an elephant and a giraffe .
the center 's web site says people will be exposed to the history of anatomical studies , including processes and specimens , such as " bone preparation , vascular casts , body slides , individual organ plastinates as well as whole-body plastinates . " the plastinarium is expected to draw thousands daily , according to van hagens , and provide up to 200 jobs in this town of 23,000 in which every fifth person is unemployed . but that has n't silenced critics who complain that van hagens methods are immoral and unethical .
bodies and commodities dozens turned out for the grand opening thursday to protest the plastinarium , singing " we shall overcome " and some holding placards that condemned the exhibition .
" no economic development with corpses " read one . many of von hagen 's most vocal critics come from within the religious community .
in guben , a pastor , michael domke , has been a particularly vocal critic of van hagens ' center there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal carcasses are included in the new center " this is a place where human body parts are exploited as if they are commodities , " he said .
" von hagens wants to make money by exploiting the dead . " still , many are thrilled that von hagens has made the town his base , saying that the factory he bought sat empty in the years since reunification .
the " plastinator , " as he calls himself , has spent 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.4 million -rrb- renovating the factory . " thousands of people inquired for the 41 jobs we have filled so far .
polls show that 80 percent of guben 's residents are behind this , " he said , referring to a tns emnid poll von hagens ' institute commissioned .
around 78 percent of the 3,000 respondents supported a permanent exhibit of plastinated corpses , against 21 percent who rejected the idea . von hagens said he invited critics to come take a look but they have so far rejected his offer . " i understand why it makes some people uncomfortable , " he added .
" it forces people to confront our own mortality which is not easy . " courting controversy von hagens is no stranger to controversy .
it was during his time as a researcher at the university of heidelberg , in 1977 , that he developed a method of preserving cadavers .
the process replaces body fluids with an odorless , plastic polymer . eventually , von hagens noticed that preserved body parts or even whole bodies might be interesting to the public at large .
he began assembling cadavers in various poses - playing basketball or chess - with organs and muscles visible .
his traveling exhibition , body worlds , inflamed church officials and some municipal authorities where the exhibits were held who called them immoral and disrespectful to the dead . but despite the protests and occasional prayer vigils , almost 20 million viewers have seen his exhibits in germany , belgium , england , switzerland , austria , south korea and the united states since the mid-1990s .
" the goal has always been to use the corpses as an instrument to increase awareness and knowledge of anatomy , " von hagens said . " we are trying to democratize anatomy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory has sat empty for more than a decade but others see money being made off of pure sensationalism that has little to do with science or edification .
" it is one thing to create an exhibit of anatomy to educate the public , " said werner schlaeke , director of the german pathologists association .
" but to pose corpses with cigarettes in their mouth or playing chess is not of educational value - it is entertainment , done for money and publicity and it is shameful . " under fire von hagens has had to also defend his techniques for acquiring cadavers for plastination . in 2001 , he was accused of using a body from a russian prison camp , a charge he denied and was eventually dropped .
two years later , he appeared before the kyrgyzstan parliament to answer charges of obtaining bodies illegally from central asian state hospitals and prisons .
von hagens operates a plastination center both in the kyrgyzstani capital , bishkek , and in china . in 2004 in germany , he faced allegations of tax evasion , falsifying credentials and using the bodies of condemned chinese prisoners without their consent .
he was fined for using the title " professor " but acquitted on all other charges . the bottom line von hagens may come with controversy , but many say that is irrelevant for a town such as guben and its unemployed residents , such as ilona wolfram . a former nurse , wolfram worked in the former textile factory where the plastinarium has been established until it closed in 1991 and has been unemployed ever since .
now she is going back to the factory and to a steady job . " i do n't have a problem with handling body parts of dead people , " she told the berliner zeitung .

but to residents , that 's no worse than being known as a one-time industrial center that is now marked by sky-high unemployment and a fast-shrinking population , as young people leave for greener pastures further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say that von hagens is exploiting the dead there , in the four-story renovated factory he bought last year , von hagens will preserve human bodies with polymers , a process he developed and dubbed " plastination . "
thousands of plastinated body parts will then be sold to universities and medical institutes . visitors , meanwhile , can view human cadavers and body parts in various states and poses -lrb- including the bond scene -rrb- as well as study corpses of animals , such as an elephant and a giraffe .
the center 's web site says people will be exposed to the history of anatomical studies , including processes and specimens , such as " bone preparation , vascular casts , body slides , individual organ plastinates as well as whole-body plastinates . " the plastinarium is expected to draw thousands daily , according to van hagens , and provide up to 200 jobs in this town of 23,000 in which every fifth person is unemployed . but that has n't silenced critics who complain that van hagens methods are immoral and unethical .
bodies and commodities dozens turned out for the grand opening thursday to protest the plastinarium , singing " we shall overcome " and some holding placards that condemned the exhibition .
" no economic development with corpses " read one . many of von hagen 's most vocal critics come from within the religious community .
in guben , a pastor , michael domke , has been a particularly vocal critic of van hagens ' center there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal carcasses are included in the new center " this is a place where human body parts are exploited as if they are commodities , " he said .
" von hagens wants to make money by exploiting the dead . " still , many are thrilled that von hagens has made the town his base , saying that the factory he bought sat empty in the years since reunification .
the " plastinator , " as he calls himself , has spent 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.4 million -rrb- renovating the factory . " thousands of people inquired for the 41 jobs we have filled so far .
polls show that 80 percent of guben 's residents are behind this , " he said , referring to a tns emnid poll von hagens ' institute commissioned .
around 78 percent of the 3,000 respondents supported a permanent exhibit of plastinated corpses , against 21 percent who rejected the idea . von hagens said he invited critics to come take a look but they have so far rejected his offer . " i understand why it makes some people uncomfortable , " he added .
" it forces people to confront our own mortality which is not easy . " courting controversy von hagens is no stranger to controversy .
it was during his time as a researcher at the university of heidelberg , in 1977 , that he developed a method of preserving cadavers .
the process replaces body fluids with an odorless , plastic polymer . eventually , von hagens noticed that preserved body parts or even whole bodies might be interesting to the public at large .
he began assembling cadavers in various poses - playing basketball or chess - with organs and muscles visible .
his traveling exhibition , body worlds , inflamed church officials and some municipal authorities where the exhibits were held who called them immoral and disrespectful to the dead . but despite the protests and occasional prayer vigils , almost 20 million viewers have seen his exhibits in germany , belgium , england , switzerland , austria , south korea and the united states since the mid-1990s .
" the goal has always been to use the corpses as an instrument to increase awareness and knowledge of anatomy , " von hagens said . " we are trying to democratize anatomy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory has sat empty for more than a decade but others see money being made off of pure sensationalism that has little to do with science or edification .
" it is one thing to create an exhibit of anatomy to educate the public , " said werner schlaeke , director of the german pathologists association .
" but to pose corpses with cigarettes in their mouth or playing chess is not of educational value - it is entertainment , done for money and publicity and it is shameful . " under fire von hagens has had to also defend his techniques for acquiring cadavers for plastination . in 2001 , he was accused of using a body from a russian prison camp , a charge he denied and was eventually dropped .
two years later , he appeared before the kyrgyzstan parliament to answer charges of obtaining bodies illegally from central asian state hospitals and prisons .
von hagens operates a plastination center both in the kyrgyzstani capital , bishkek , and in china . in 2004 in germany , he faced allegations of tax evasion , falsifying credentials and using the bodies of condemned chinese prisoners without their consent .
he was fined for using the title " professor " but acquitted on all other charges . the bottom line von hagens may come with controversy , but many say that is irrelevant for a town such as guben and its unemployed residents , such as ilona wolfram . a former nurse , wolfram worked in the former textile factory where the plastinarium has been established until it closed in 1991 and has been unemployed ever since .
now she is going back to the factory and to a steady job . " i do n't have a problem with handling body parts of dead people , " she told the berliner zeitung .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 20.11.2006 german town pins revival hopes on corpse workshop großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' dr. death ' opens a new center to process corpses a struggling eastern german town is now home to the " plastinarium , " a workshop set up by the controversial anatomist behind the " body world " exhibitions , where dissected human corpses were displayed in lifelike poses . anatomist gunther von hagens made a name for himself dissecting corpses , " plastinating " them , and exhibiting them - and their viscera - doing everything from riding a horse to playing chess .
now , in the small town of guben , on the polish border , visitors to von hagens ' latest venture can see a group of corpses playing cards in a scene taken from the newest james bond film , " casino royale . " dubbed dr. death by the newsmagazine der spiegel , von hagens ' " plastinarium , " which opened to the public on friday , is half workshop , half cadaver museum .
to many , it is the height of morbidity .
but to others in the town of guben , where it has opened in a disused wool factory , it might be the ticket to at least a small economic revival after years of decline . guben may achieve renown or notoriety for cadavers in the future .
but to residents , that 's no worse than being known as a one-time industrial center that is now marked by sky-high unemployment and a fast-shrinking population , as young people leave for greener pastures further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say that von hagens is exploiting the dead there , in the four-story renovated factory he bought last year , von hagens will preserve human bodies with polymers , a process he developed and dubbed " plastination . "
thousands of plastinated body parts will then be sold to universities and medical institutes . visitors , meanwhile , can view human cadavers and body parts in various states and poses -lrb- including the bond scene -rrb- as well as study corpses of animals , such as an elephant and a giraffe .
the center 's web site says people will be exposed to the history of anatomical studies , including processes and specimens , such as " bone preparation , vascular casts , body slides , individual organ plastinates as well as whole-body plastinates . " the plastinarium is expected to draw thousands daily , according to van hagens , and provide up to 200 jobs in this town of 23,000 in which every fifth person is unemployed . but that has n't silenced critics who complain that van hagens methods are immoral and unethical .
bodies and commodities dozens turned out for the grand opening thursday to protest the plastinarium , singing " we shall overcome " and some holding placards that condemned the exhibition .
" no economic development with corpses " read one . many of von hagen 's most vocal critics come from within the religious community .
in guben , a pastor , michael domke , has been a particularly vocal critic of van hagens ' center there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal carcasses are included in the new center " this is a place where human body parts are exploited as if they are commodities , " he said .
" von hagens wants to make money by exploiting the dead . " still , many are thrilled that von hagens has made the town his base , saying that the factory he bought sat empty in the years since reunification .
the " plastinator , " as he calls himself , has spent 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.4 million -rrb- renovating the factory . " thousands of people inquired for the 41 jobs we have filled so far .
polls show that 80 percent of guben 's residents are behind this , " he said , referring to a tns emnid poll von hagens ' institute commissioned .
around 78 percent of the 3,000 respondents supported a permanent exhibit of plastinated corpses , against 21 percent who rejected the idea . von hagens said he invited critics to come take a look but they have so far rejected his offer . " i understand why it makes some people uncomfortable , " he added .
" it forces people to confront our own mortality which is not easy . " courting controversy von hagens is no stranger to controversy .
it was during his time as a researcher at the university of heidelberg , in 1977 , that he developed a method of preserving cadavers .
the process replaces body fluids with an odorless , plastic polymer . eventually , von hagens noticed that preserved body parts or even whole bodies might be interesting to the public at large .
he began assembling cadavers in various poses - playing basketball or chess - with organs and muscles visible .
his traveling exhibition , body worlds , inflamed church officials and some municipal authorities where the exhibits were held who called them immoral and disrespectful to the dead . but despite the protests and occasional prayer vigils , almost 20 million viewers have seen his exhibits in germany , belgium , england , switzerland , austria , south korea and the united states since the mid-1990s .
" the goal has always been to use the corpses as an instrument to increase awareness and knowledge of anatomy , " von hagens said . " we are trying to democratize anatomy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory has sat empty for more than a decade but others see money being made off of pure sensationalism that has little to do with science or edification .
" it is one thing to create an exhibit of anatomy to educate the public , " said werner schlaeke , director of the german pathologists association .
" but to pose corpses with cigarettes in their mouth or playing chess is not of educational value - it is entertainment , done for money and publicity and it is shameful . " under fire von hagens has had to also defend his techniques for acquiring cadavers for plastination . in 2001 , he was accused of using a body from a russian prison camp , a charge he denied and was eventually dropped .
two years later , he appeared before the kyrgyzstan parliament to answer charges of obtaining bodies illegally from central asian state hospitals and prisons .
von hagens operates a plastination center both in the kyrgyzstani capital , bishkek , and in china . in 2004 in germany , he faced allegations of tax evasion , falsifying credentials and using the bodies of condemned chinese prisoners without their consent .
he was fined for using the title " professor " but acquitted on all other charges . the bottom line von hagens may come with controversy , but many say that is irrelevant for a town such as guben and its unemployed residents , such as ilona wolfram . a former nurse , wolfram worked in the former textile factory where the plastinarium has been established until it closed in 1991 and has been unemployed ever since .
now she is going back to the factory and to a steady job . " i do n't have a problem with handling body parts of dead people , " she told the berliner zeitung .

" von hagens wants to make money by exploiting the dead . " still , many are thrilled that von hagens has made the town his base , saying that the factory he bought sat empty in the years since reunification .
the " plastinator , " as he calls himself , has spent 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.4 million -rrb- renovating the factory . " thousands of people inquired for the 41 jobs we have filled so far .
polls show that 80 percent of guben 's residents are behind this , " he said , referring to a tns emnid poll von hagens ' institute commissioned .
around 78 percent of the 3,000 respondents supported a permanent exhibit of plastinated corpses , against 21 percent who rejected the idea . von hagens said he invited critics to come take a look but they have so far rejected his offer . " i understand why it makes some people uncomfortable , " he added .
" it forces people to confront our own mortality which is not easy . " courting controversy von hagens is no stranger to controversy .
it was during his time as a researcher at the university of heidelberg , in 1977 , that he developed a method of preserving cadavers .
the process replaces body fluids with an odorless , plastic polymer . eventually , von hagens noticed that preserved body parts or even whole bodies might be interesting to the public at large .
he began assembling cadavers in various poses - playing basketball or chess - with organs and muscles visible .
his traveling exhibition , body worlds , inflamed church officials and some municipal authorities where the exhibits were held who called them immoral and disrespectful to the dead . but despite the protests and occasional prayer vigils , almost 20 million viewers have seen his exhibits in germany , belgium , england , switzerland , austria , south korea and the united states since the mid-1990s .
" the goal has always been to use the corpses as an instrument to increase awareness and knowledge of anatomy , " von hagens said . " we are trying to democratize anatomy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory has sat empty for more than a decade but others see money being made off of pure sensationalism that has little to do with science or edification .
" it is one thing to create an exhibit of anatomy to educate the public , " said werner schlaeke , director of the german pathologists association .
" but to pose corpses with cigarettes in their mouth or playing chess is not of educational value - it is entertainment , done for money and publicity and it is shameful . " under fire von hagens has had to also defend his techniques for acquiring cadavers for plastination . in 2001 , he was accused of using a body from a russian prison camp , a charge he denied and was eventually dropped .
two years later , he appeared before the kyrgyzstan parliament to answer charges of obtaining bodies illegally from central asian state hospitals and prisons .
von hagens operates a plastination center both in the kyrgyzstani capital , bishkek , and in china . in 2004 in germany , he faced allegations of tax evasion , falsifying credentials and using the bodies of condemned chinese prisoners without their consent .
he was fined for using the title " professor " but acquitted on all other charges . the bottom line von hagens may come with controversy , but many say that is irrelevant for a town such as guben and its unemployed residents , such as ilona wolfram . a former nurse , wolfram worked in the former textile factory where the plastinarium has been established until it closed in 1991 and has been unemployed ever since .

now , in the small town of guben , on the polish border , visitors to von hagens ' latest venture can see a group of corpses playing cards in a scene taken from the newest james bond film , " casino royale . " dubbed dr. death by the newsmagazine der spiegel , von hagens ' " plastinarium , " which opened to the public on friday , is half workshop , half cadaver museum .
to many , it is the height of morbidity .
but to others in the town of guben , where it has opened in a disused wool factory , it might be the ticket to at least a small economic revival after years of decline . guben may achieve renown or notoriety for cadavers in the future .
but to residents , that 's no worse than being known as a one-time industrial center that is now marked by sky-high unemployment and a fast-shrinking population , as young people leave for greener pastures further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say that von hagens is exploiting the dead there , in the four-story renovated factory he bought last year , von hagens will preserve human bodies with polymers , a process he developed and dubbed " plastination .

thousands of plastinated body parts will then be sold to universities and medical institutes . visitors , meanwhile , can view human cadavers and body parts in various states and poses -lrb- including the bond scene -rrb- as well as study corpses of animals , such as an elephant and a giraffe .
the center 's web site says people will be exposed to the history of anatomical studies , including processes and specimens , such as " bone preparation , vascular casts , body slides , individual organ plastinates as well as whole-body plastinates . " the plastinarium is expected to draw thousands daily , according to van hagens , and provide up to 200 jobs in this town of 23,000 in which every fifth person is unemployed . but that has n't silenced critics who complain that van hagens methods are immoral and unethical .

now , in the small town of guben , on the polish border , visitors to von hagens ' latest venture can see a group of corpses playing cards in a scene taken from the newest james bond film , " casino royale . " dubbed dr. death by the newsmagazine der spiegel , von hagens ' " plastinarium , " which opened to the public on friday , is half workshop , half cadaver museum .
to many , it is the height of morbidity .
but to others in the town of guben , where it has opened in a disused wool factory , it might be the ticket to at least a small economic revival after years of decline . guben may achieve renown or notoriety for cadavers in the future .
but to residents , that 's no worse than being known as a one-time industrial center that is now marked by sky-high unemployment and a fast-shrinking population , as young people leave for greener pastures further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say that von hagens is exploiting the dead there , in the four-story renovated factory he bought last year , von hagens will preserve human bodies with polymers , a process he developed and dubbed " plastination . "
thousands of plastinated body parts will then be sold to universities and medical institutes . visitors , meanwhile , can view human cadavers and body parts in various states and poses -lrb- including the bond scene -rrb- as well as study corpses of animals , such as an elephant and a giraffe .
the center 's web site says people will be exposed to the history of anatomical studies , including processes and specimens , such as " bone preparation , vascular casts , body slides , individual organ plastinates as well as whole-body plastinates . " the plastinarium is expected to draw thousands daily , according to van hagens , and provide up to 200 jobs in this town of 23,000 in which every fifth person is unemployed . but that has n't silenced critics who complain that van hagens methods are immoral and unethical .
bodies and commodities dozens turned out for the grand opening thursday to protest the plastinarium , singing " we shall overcome " and some holding placards that condemned the exhibition .
" no economic development with corpses " read one . many of von hagen 's most vocal critics come from within the religious community .
in guben , a pastor , michael domke , has been a particularly vocal critic of van hagens ' center there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal carcasses are included in the new center " this is a place where human body parts are exploited as if they are commodities , " he said .
" von hagens wants to make money by exploiting the dead . " still , many are thrilled that von hagens has made the town his base , saying that the factory he bought sat empty in the years since reunification .
the " plastinator , " as he calls himself , has spent 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.4 million -rrb- renovating the factory . " thousands of people inquired for the 41 jobs we have filled so far .
polls show that 80 percent of guben 's residents are behind this , " he said , referring to a tns emnid poll von hagens ' institute commissioned .
around 78 percent of the 3,000 respondents supported a permanent exhibit of plastinated corpses , against 21 percent who rejected the idea . von hagens said he invited critics to come take a look but they have so far rejected his offer . " i understand why it makes some people uncomfortable , " he added .
" it forces people to confront our own mortality which is not easy . " courting controversy von hagens is no stranger to controversy .
it was during his time as a researcher at the university of heidelberg , in 1977 , that he developed a method of preserving cadavers .
the process replaces body fluids with an odorless , plastic polymer . eventually , von hagens noticed that preserved body parts or even whole bodies might be interesting to the public at large .
he began assembling cadavers in various poses - playing basketball or chess - with organs and muscles visible .
his traveling exhibition , body worlds , inflamed church officials and some municipal authorities where the exhibits were held who called them immoral and disrespectful to the dead . but despite the protests and occasional prayer vigils , almost 20 million viewers have seen his exhibits in germany , belgium , england , switzerland , austria , south korea and the united states since the mid-1990s .
" the goal has always been to use the corpses as an instrument to increase awareness and knowledge of anatomy , " von hagens said . " we are trying to democratize anatomy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory has sat empty for more than a decade but others see money being made off of pure sensationalism that has little to do with science or edification .
" it is one thing to create an exhibit of anatomy to educate the public , " said werner schlaeke , director of the german pathologists association .
" but to pose corpses with cigarettes in their mouth or playing chess is not of educational value - it is entertainment , done for money and publicity and it is shameful . " under fire von hagens has had to also defend his techniques for acquiring cadavers for plastination . in 2001 , he was accused of using a body from a russian prison camp , a charge he denied and was eventually dropped .
two years later , he appeared before the kyrgyzstan parliament to answer charges of obtaining bodies illegally from central asian state hospitals and prisons .

the unnamed official said allied commanders should be able to call the germans in the morning , asking for a battalion , and it should be there by the evening . he said washington was frustrated by the mandate restrictions which were confining several foreign armies to the sidelines of conflicts in southern afghanistan . us unhappy with obstacles the us defense official was quoted in reports as saying that he did not like these stumbling blocks and that such a restrictive policy showed no solidarity with those western troops fighting the taliban in the south of the country . at present , there are some 2,700 german troops in the north of afghanistan where they hold the command of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- contingent . however , us and some european nato member countries feel german troops should also be deployed in the more dangerous southern parts of afghanistan .

" we have a large contingent on the balkans , we 're part of the unifil mission in lebanon , and german troops are also at the horn of africa to prevent the smuggling of weapons by sea to terrorists , " schulz said .

" during the summer , several suspects made contact with an individual who had access to the security-restricted zone of an airport , " said a statement from the federal prosecutor 's office . the plan , however , fell apart when the unidentified suspects failed to reach agreement with the airport employee on the payment he was to receive .
it was not clear if the helper was someone employed by the airport , an airline or a subcontractor . prosecutors have questioned six suspects they believe were involved in bomb plot , which reportedly was to take place at frankfurt airport , a hub of international air traffic . " with the exception of one suspect who is in prison for another offense , the other suspects were released on saturday , " the statement said . police also searched nine houses in the german states of rhineland-palatinate and hesse over the weekend . suspected of belonging to terrorist organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new regulations for liquids in carry-on luggage went into effect earlier this month according to the prosecutor 's office , the suspects had made contact several times with members of an unknown group without coming to an agreement on the size of the fee for smuggling the suitcase onto the plane . the prosecutor 's office gave no details about the nationality of the suspects , nor would they reveal the planned timing of the attack . an aircraft belonging to the israeli airline el al may have been targeted , reported die welt daily .

some 60,000 passengers have to pass through security checks each day . " with 60,000 passengers every day , 100 percent security is n't possible , " said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble last week , reported ap . the german government on monday said it would not increase its security warning in light of the new investigation . " we always have to count on there being groups of people who are considering real plans , " an interior ministry spokesperson said in berlin . germany must remain vigilant germany was shaken in the summer after it was discovered that homemade bombs hidden in suitcases failed to explode on two regional passenger trains in an apparent bid to copy the devastating train bombings in madrid and london . two lebanese men have been charged with planting the devices on trains heading for the western cities of hamm , near dortmund , and koblenz , on july 31 . germany 's federal prosecutor monika harms warned last week that although no attack had taken place on german soil recently , the apparent peace " could be deceptive " and the country must remain vigilant . dw staff -lrb- kh / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making sense of new eu airport security regulations the eu 's new airport security rules regarding hand baggage and liquids came into force monday .

" during the summer , several suspects made contact with an individual who had access to the security-restricted zone of an airport , " said a statement from the federal prosecutor 's office . the plan , however , fell apart when the unidentified suspects failed to reach agreement with the airport employee on the payment he was to receive .
it was not clear if the helper was someone employed by the airport , an airline or a subcontractor . prosecutors have questioned six suspects they believe were involved in bomb plot , which reportedly was to take place at frankfurt airport , a hub of international air traffic . " with the exception of one suspect who is in prison for another offense , the other suspects were released on saturday , " the statement said . police also searched nine houses in the german states of rhineland-palatinate and hesse over the weekend . suspected of belonging to terrorist organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new regulations for liquids in carry-on luggage went into effect earlier this month according to the prosecutor 's office , the suspects had made contact several times with members of an unknown group without coming to an agreement on the size of the fee for smuggling the suitcase onto the plane . the prosecutor 's office gave no details about the nationality of the suspects , nor would they reveal the planned timing of the attack . an aircraft belonging to the israeli airline el al may have been targeted , reported die welt daily .
the airline has been a target of islamic terrorists for decades and its planes are accompanied by armored police vehicles at some airports . new reports wo n't affect security warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testers smuggled dangerous materials through frankfurt , according to media reports frankfurt is a busy hub for many flights to israel , as well as the us , great britain and other potentially targeted countries .

" with 60,000 passengers every day , 100 percent security is n't possible , " said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble last week , reported ap . the german government on monday said it would not increase its security warning in light of the new investigation . " we always have to count on there being groups of people who are considering real plans , " an interior ministry spokesperson said in berlin . germany must remain vigilant germany was shaken in the summer after it was discovered that homemade bombs hidden in suitcases failed to explode on two regional passenger trains in an apparent bid to copy the devastating train bombings in madrid and london . two lebanese men have been charged with planting the devices on trains heading for the western cities of hamm , near dortmund , and koblenz , on july 31 . germany 's federal prosecutor monika harms warned last week that although no attack had taken place on german soil recently , the apparent peace " could be deceptive " and the country must remain vigilant . dw staff -lrb- kh / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making sense of new eu airport security regulations the eu 's new airport security rules regarding hand baggage and liquids came into force monday .

dw.world.de spoke with the council president lutz tillmanns . the german press council sets its goal as overseeing that journalists report accurately and working to stop discrimination and slander as well as preventing the press from using dishonest research methods .
the council , however , does not have the authority to impose sanctions and can only give out warnings and reprimands . the german press council started life in bonn in 1956 when a group of five publishers and five journalists were sitting around a pub table .
they wanted to make a stand against the federal press law .
at the time , the interior minister was planning to establish a federal press watchdog .
instead , the journalists and publishers set up their own . dw.world.de : what does the german press council do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council was founded by journalists and publishers in 1956 we defend press freedom , for example when official inquiries impact journalistic content .
we become involved when editorial offices are searched or when material is confiscated . we also become involved when there are issues such as journalists showing bias towards a particular brand or company in their work , in a deceptive and sneaky way .
or when it comes to questions of journalistic dependence , such as how far can a journalist 's relationship go .
or what are the problems concerning the protection of victims in the media .
in addition , we also work through between 600 and 800 individual complaints per year regarding individual articles . what are the issues surrounding press freedom in germany ?
does freedom of the press need to be protected in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press council in 2006 - struggles for press freedom are still continuing today press freedom and freedom of expression are enshrined in germany 's constitution , but still there are some questions that need to be resolved : how do journalists receive access to information ; who is obligated , in the government departments , to give out this information .
other issues include what happens when i receive information and want to protect my source , but the police or state prosecutors does n't consider that , what happens to press freedom then ? it is not uncommon that a journalist 's work is confiscated , and legal authorities try to find out the source or materials to then use this information in order to prosecute the case . these are points where press freedom is really pushed to the limit , and that 's when fine-tuning becomes necessary . why does the press council operate under voluntary controls , and not state control ? it would be counter-productive if we would provoke the state to tighten laws against the media .
the existence of the press council over the last 50 years has shown that the german federal government and states are very careful about the regulation of the press through laws .
i think it is right that the industry recognizes for itself that it has to work for its privileges and has to be responsible .
that is why is should be voluntary , because then there is no obligation to the state , and with the voluntary system we have greater recognition of our role . but what about with tabloid papers , such as the bild , what can an official reprimand really mean to such a media giant ? even the bild and its current editor-in-chief are annoyed when other media report that bild has been reprimanded .
they also have to print the reprimands in the paper themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild has been repremanded on various occassions complaint investigations several times a year also use considerable resources .
this means the editor-in-chief and the legal department and other departments have to address the issue .
if they could avoid complaints investigations by the press council , then they would surely do so . does the press council need to be able to give out stronger punishments ? i believe that we do n't need other punishments ; we need more effective self-control perhaps with more publicity , that we receive more response from the press .
the german president emphasized that in his speech today . what are the press council 's struggles for the future ? we will certainly be looking at the grey zone between journalism and pr .
we do that already , but we need to increase our efforts here .
the electronic press is also very important - the recognition that the code of ethics is valid for electronic press as well as printed press - that is the information that is professionally published in the internet . also the defense of freedom of the press .
when i think of how many editorial departments have been searched , how much material has been confiscated , such as at cicero magazine , or dresden 's morgenpost .
journalists have been listened to on the telephone .
there are continual injuries of the press freedom .
we have to stay on the ball and push for better regulations . kate hairsine interviewed lutz tillmanns -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reporters without borders fights censorship with online demo the international human rights organization reporters without borders is sponsoring a 24-hour cyber demonstration against internet censorship , starting tuesday , nov .

at the time , the interior minister was planning to establish a federal press watchdog .
instead , the journalists and publishers set up their own . dw.world.de : what does the german press council do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council was founded by journalists and publishers in 1956 we defend press freedom , for example when official inquiries impact journalistic content .
we become involved when editorial offices are searched or when material is confiscated . we also become involved when there are issues such as journalists showing bias towards a particular brand or company in their work , in a deceptive and sneaky way .
or when it comes to questions of journalistic dependence , such as how far can a journalist 's relationship go .
or what are the problems concerning the protection of victims in the media .
in addition , we also work through between 600 and 800 individual complaints per year regarding individual articles . what are the issues surrounding press freedom in germany ?
does freedom of the press need to be protected in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press council in 2006 - struggles for press freedom are still continuing today press freedom and freedom of expression are enshrined in germany 's constitution , but still there are some questions that need to be resolved : how do journalists receive access to information ; who is obligated , in the government departments , to give out this information .
other issues include what happens when i receive information and want to protect my source , but the police or state prosecutors does n't consider that , what happens to press freedom then ? it is not uncommon that a journalist 's work is confiscated , and legal authorities try to find out the source or materials to then use this information in order to prosecute the case . these are points where press freedom is really pushed to the limit , and that 's when fine-tuning becomes necessary . why does the press council operate under voluntary controls , and not state control ? it would be counter-productive if we would provoke the state to tighten laws against the media .
the existence of the press council over the last 50 years has shown that the german federal government and states are very careful about the regulation of the press through laws .
i think it is right that the industry recognizes for itself that it has to work for its privileges and has to be responsible .
that is why is should be voluntary , because then there is no obligation to the state , and with the voluntary system we have greater recognition of our role . but what about with tabloid papers , such as the bild , what can an official reprimand really mean to such a media giant ? even the bild and its current editor-in-chief are annoyed when other media report that bild has been reprimanded .
they also have to print the reprimands in the paper themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild has been repremanded on various occassions complaint investigations several times a year also use considerable resources .
this means the editor-in-chief and the legal department and other departments have to address the issue .
if they could avoid complaints investigations by the press council , then they would surely do so . does the press council need to be able to give out stronger punishments ? i believe that we do n't need other punishments ; we need more effective self-control perhaps with more publicity , that we receive more response from the press .
the german president emphasized that in his speech today . what are the press council 's struggles for the future ? we will certainly be looking at the grey zone between journalism and pr .
we do that already , but we need to increase our efforts here .
the electronic press is also very important - the recognition that the code of ethics is valid for electronic press as well as printed press - that is the information that is professionally published in the internet . also the defense of freedom of the press .
when i think of how many editorial departments have been searched , how much material has been confiscated , such as at cicero magazine , or dresden 's morgenpost .
journalists have been listened to on the telephone .

" schumann , winner of the olympic gold medal at the 2000 olympics in sydney , former 400-meter runner breuer and the unknown athlete have been asked to give statements to the german athletics federation -lrb- dlv -rrb- . " the dlv have taken the case to their disciplinary commission because of breach of rules relating to the use of medications by these two athletes , " dlv president clemens prokop said . a complaint has also been filed with state prosecutors by the dlv in magdeburg against spanish doctor miguel angel peraita and dutch agent jos hermens , implicated in the affair of german coach thomas springstein . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumann , after winning the olympic gold , is suspected of doping peraita has reportedly been linked with madrid doctor eufemiano fuentes , who is under investigation in spain in a high-profile doping scandal that involved former tour de france winner jan ulrich and giro d 'italia winner ivan basso . springstein , who is breuer 's partner and a former coach of schumann 's , was sentenced to a suspended sentence of 16 months in jail last march after being found guilty of giving performance enhancing drugs to minors . enforcing zero-tolerance policy the dlv said the complaint was based on the importation and distribution of medical products for use in doping .

" " germany is unreservedly committed to its moral obligation to restore art seized by the nazis , " he added .
" there will be no watering down of this obligation . " no concrete decisions were made concerning how the restitution could take place , said government spokesperson thomas steg , adding that the gathering served as a forum to exchange ideas and information . germany sees a particular moral responsibility in the matter , steg said . kirchner 's 1913 oil had belonged to the jewish art collector alfred hess before it was acquired by the nazis .

" it has to be made clear to those in charge that -lrb- provenance research -rrb- ca n't just be done on the side , " said roth .
" it is criminology paired with a lot of technical knowledge . " since 1991 , the state art collection in dresden has returned over 800 objects and works of art , said the general director . second round-table planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neumann said the restitution business is highly commercialized roth has also advocated finding a european , and not purely german , solution to the matter . neumann highlighted moral responsibility and the need for transparency in restitution deals .
he said museums are complaining that the restitution business has become extremely commercialized . a second restitution summit is in the works , according to german news agency dpa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 20.11.2006 german town pins revival hopes on corpse workshop großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' dr. death ' opens a new center to process corpses a struggling eastern german town is now home to the " plastinarium , " a workshop set up by the controversial anatomist behind the " body world " exhibitions , where dissected human corpses were displayed in lifelike poses . anatomist gunther von hagens made a name for himself dissecting corpses , " plastinating " them , and exhibiting them - and their viscera - doing everything from riding a horse to playing chess .
now , in the small town of guben , on the polish border , visitors to von hagens ' latest venture can see a group of corpses playing cards in a scene taken from the newest james bond film , " casino royale . " dubbed dr. death by the newsmagazine der spiegel , von hagens ' " plastinarium , " which opened to the public on friday , is half workshop , half cadaver museum .
to many , it is the height of morbidity .
but to others in the town of guben , where it has opened in a disused wool factory , it might be the ticket to at least a small economic revival after years of decline . guben may achieve renown or notoriety for cadavers in the future .
but to residents , that 's no worse than being known as a one-time industrial center that is now marked by sky-high unemployment and a fast-shrinking population , as young people leave for greener pastures further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say that von hagens is exploiting the dead there , in the four-story renovated factory he bought last year , von hagens will preserve human bodies with polymers , a process he developed and dubbed " plastination . "
thousands of plastinated body parts will then be sold to universities and medical institutes . visitors , meanwhile , can view human cadavers and body parts in various states and poses -lrb- including the bond scene -rrb- as well as study corpses of animals , such as an elephant and a giraffe .
the center 's web site says people will be exposed to the history of anatomical studies , including processes and specimens , such as " bone preparation , vascular casts , body slides , individual organ plastinates as well as whole-body plastinates . " the plastinarium is expected to draw thousands daily , according to van hagens , and provide up to 200 jobs in this town of 23,000 in which every fifth person is unemployed . but that has n't silenced critics who complain that van hagens methods are immoral and unethical .
bodies and commodities dozens turned out for the grand opening thursday to protest the plastinarium , singing " we shall overcome " and some holding placards that condemned the exhibition .
" no economic development with corpses " read one . many of von hagen 's most vocal critics come from within the religious community .
in guben , a pastor , michael domke , has been a particularly vocal critic of van hagens ' center there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal carcasses are included in the new center " this is a place where human body parts are exploited as if they are commodities , " he said .
" von hagens wants to make money by exploiting the dead . " still , many are thrilled that von hagens has made the town his base , saying that the factory he bought sat empty in the years since reunification .
the " plastinator , " as he calls himself , has spent 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.4 million -rrb- renovating the factory . " thousands of people inquired for the 41 jobs we have filled so far .
polls show that 80 percent of guben 's residents are behind this , " he said , referring to a tns emnid poll von hagens ' institute commissioned .
around 78 percent of the 3,000 respondents supported a permanent exhibit of plastinated corpses , against 21 percent who rejected the idea . von hagens said he invited critics to come take a look but they have so far rejected his offer . " i understand why it makes some people uncomfortable , " he added .
" it forces people to confront our own mortality which is not easy . " courting controversy von hagens is no stranger to controversy .
it was during his time as a researcher at the university of heidelberg , in 1977 , that he developed a method of preserving cadavers .
the process replaces body fluids with an odorless , plastic polymer . eventually , von hagens noticed that preserved body parts or even whole bodies might be interesting to the public at large .
he began assembling cadavers in various poses - playing basketball or chess - with organs and muscles visible .
his traveling exhibition , body worlds , inflamed church officials and some municipal authorities where the exhibits were held who called them immoral and disrespectful to the dead . but despite the protests and occasional prayer vigils , almost 20 million viewers have seen his exhibits in germany , belgium , england , switzerland , austria , south korea and the united states since the mid-1990s .
" the goal has always been to use the corpses as an instrument to increase awareness and knowledge of anatomy , " von hagens said . " we are trying to democratize anatomy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory has sat empty for more than a decade but others see money being made off of pure sensationalism that has little to do with science or edification .
" it is one thing to create an exhibit of anatomy to educate the public , " said werner schlaeke , director of the german pathologists association .
" but to pose corpses with cigarettes in their mouth or playing chess is not of educational value - it is entertainment , done for money and publicity and it is shameful . " under fire von hagens has had to also defend his techniques for acquiring cadavers for plastination . in 2001 , he was accused of using a body from a russian prison camp , a charge he denied and was eventually dropped .
two years later , he appeared before the kyrgyzstan parliament to answer charges of obtaining bodies illegally from central asian state hospitals and prisons .
von hagens operates a plastination center both in the kyrgyzstani capital , bishkek , and in china . in 2004 in germany , he faced allegations of tax evasion , falsifying credentials and using the bodies of condemned chinese prisoners without their consent .
he was fined for using the title " professor " but acquitted on all other charges . the bottom line von hagens may come with controversy , but many say that is irrelevant for a town such as guben and its unemployed residents , such as ilona wolfram . a former nurse , wolfram worked in the former textile factory where the plastinarium has been established until it closed in 1991 and has been unemployed ever since .
now she is going back to the factory and to a steady job . " i do n't have a problem with handling body parts of dead people , " she told the berliner zeitung .

" " germany is unreservedly committed to its moral obligation to restore art seized by the nazis , " he added .
" there will be no watering down of this obligation . " no concrete decisions were made concerning how the restitution could take place , said government spokesperson thomas steg , adding that the gathering served as a forum to exchange ideas and information . germany sees a particular moral responsibility in the matter , steg said . kirchner 's 1913 oil had belonged to the jewish art collector alfred hess before it was acquired by the nazis .

more than a dozen art institutions are affected , according to some estimates . monday 's meeting heard that 1,000 german museums and galleries are bracing for restitution claims .
there are claims in the pipeline for some 100 works from the expressionist period alone . one approach is to develop a special restitution fund that would put museums in the financial position to be able to buy back restituted works , steg said . martin roth , general director of the state art collection in dresden appealed for greater investment in provenance research , which traces the origins of a work of art . " it has to be made clear to those in charge that -lrb- provenance research -rrb- ca n't just be done on the side , " said roth .
" it is criminology paired with a lot of technical knowledge . " since 1991 , the state art collection in dresden has returned over 800 objects and works of art , said the general director . second round-table planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neumann said the restitution business is highly commercialized roth has also advocated finding a european , and not purely german , solution to the matter . neumann highlighted moral responsibility and the need for transparency in restitution deals .
he said museums are complaining that the restitution business has become extremely commercialized . a second restitution summit is in the works , according to german news agency dpa .

" " germany is unreservedly committed to its moral obligation to restore art seized by the nazis , " he added .
" there will be no watering down of this obligation . " no concrete decisions were made concerning how the restitution could take place , said government spokesperson thomas steg , adding that the gathering served as a forum to exchange ideas and information . germany sees a particular moral responsibility in the matter , steg said . kirchner 's 1913 oil had belonged to the jewish art collector alfred hess before it was acquired by the nazis .

more than a dozen art institutions are affected , according to some estimates . monday 's meeting heard that 1,000 german museums and galleries are bracing for restitution claims .
there are claims in the pipeline for some 100 works from the expressionist period alone . one approach is to develop a special restitution fund that would put museums in the financial position to be able to buy back restituted works , steg said . martin roth , general director of the state art collection in dresden appealed for greater investment in provenance research , which traces the origins of a work of art . " it has to be made clear to those in charge that -lrb- provenance research -rrb- ca n't just be done on the side , " said roth .
" it is criminology paired with a lot of technical knowledge . " since 1991 , the state art collection in dresden has returned over 800 objects and works of art , said the general director . second round-table planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neumann said the restitution business is highly commercialized roth has also advocated finding a european , and not purely german , solution to the matter . neumann highlighted moral responsibility and the need for transparency in restitution deals .
he said museums are complaining that the restitution business has become extremely commercialized . a second restitution summit is in the works , according to german news agency dpa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 20.11.2006 german town pins revival hopes on corpse workshop großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' dr. death ' opens a new center to process corpses a struggling eastern german town is now home to the " plastinarium , " a workshop set up by the controversial anatomist behind the " body world " exhibitions , where dissected human corpses were displayed in lifelike poses . anatomist gunther von hagens made a name for himself dissecting corpses , " plastinating " them , and exhibiting them - and their viscera - doing everything from riding a horse to playing chess .
now , in the small town of guben , on the polish border , visitors to von hagens ' latest venture can see a group of corpses playing cards in a scene taken from the newest james bond film , " casino royale . " dubbed dr. death by the newsmagazine der spiegel , von hagens ' " plastinarium , " which opened to the public on friday , is half workshop , half cadaver museum .
to many , it is the height of morbidity .
but to others in the town of guben , where it has opened in a disused wool factory , it might be the ticket to at least a small economic revival after years of decline . guben may achieve renown or notoriety for cadavers in the future .
but to residents , that 's no worse than being known as a one-time industrial center that is now marked by sky-high unemployment and a fast-shrinking population , as young people leave for greener pastures further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say that von hagens is exploiting the dead there , in the four-story renovated factory he bought last year , von hagens will preserve human bodies with polymers , a process he developed and dubbed " plastination . "
thousands of plastinated body parts will then be sold to universities and medical institutes . visitors , meanwhile , can view human cadavers and body parts in various states and poses -lrb- including the bond scene -rrb- as well as study corpses of animals , such as an elephant and a giraffe .
the center 's web site says people will be exposed to the history of anatomical studies , including processes and specimens , such as " bone preparation , vascular casts , body slides , individual organ plastinates as well as whole-body plastinates . " the plastinarium is expected to draw thousands daily , according to van hagens , and provide up to 200 jobs in this town of 23,000 in which every fifth person is unemployed . but that has n't silenced critics who complain that van hagens methods are immoral and unethical .
bodies and commodities dozens turned out for the grand opening thursday to protest the plastinarium , singing " we shall overcome " and some holding placards that condemned the exhibition .
" no economic development with corpses " read one . many of von hagen 's most vocal critics come from within the religious community .
in guben , a pastor , michael domke , has been a particularly vocal critic of van hagens ' center there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal carcasses are included in the new center " this is a place where human body parts are exploited as if they are commodities , " he said .
" von hagens wants to make money by exploiting the dead . " still , many are thrilled that von hagens has made the town his base , saying that the factory he bought sat empty in the years since reunification .
the " plastinator , " as he calls himself , has spent 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.4 million -rrb- renovating the factory . " thousands of people inquired for the 41 jobs we have filled so far .
polls show that 80 percent of guben 's residents are behind this , " he said , referring to a tns emnid poll von hagens ' institute commissioned .
around 78 percent of the 3,000 respondents supported a permanent exhibit of plastinated corpses , against 21 percent who rejected the idea . von hagens said he invited critics to come take a look but they have so far rejected his offer . " i understand why it makes some people uncomfortable , " he added .
" it forces people to confront our own mortality which is not easy . " courting controversy von hagens is no stranger to controversy .
it was during his time as a researcher at the university of heidelberg , in 1977 , that he developed a method of preserving cadavers .
the process replaces body fluids with an odorless , plastic polymer . eventually , von hagens noticed that preserved body parts or even whole bodies might be interesting to the public at large .
he began assembling cadavers in various poses - playing basketball or chess - with organs and muscles visible .
his traveling exhibition , body worlds , inflamed church officials and some municipal authorities where the exhibits were held who called them immoral and disrespectful to the dead . but despite the protests and occasional prayer vigils , almost 20 million viewers have seen his exhibits in germany , belgium , england , switzerland , austria , south korea and the united states since the mid-1990s .
" the goal has always been to use the corpses as an instrument to increase awareness and knowledge of anatomy , " von hagens said . " we are trying to democratize anatomy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory has sat empty for more than a decade but others see money being made off of pure sensationalism that has little to do with science or edification .
" it is one thing to create an exhibit of anatomy to educate the public , " said werner schlaeke , director of the german pathologists association .
" but to pose corpses with cigarettes in their mouth or playing chess is not of educational value - it is entertainment , done for money and publicity and it is shameful . " under fire von hagens has had to also defend his techniques for acquiring cadavers for plastination . in 2001 , he was accused of using a body from a russian prison camp , a charge he denied and was eventually dropped .
two years later , he appeared before the kyrgyzstan parliament to answer charges of obtaining bodies illegally from central asian state hospitals and prisons .
von hagens operates a plastination center both in the kyrgyzstani capital , bishkek , and in china . in 2004 in germany , he faced allegations of tax evasion , falsifying credentials and using the bodies of condemned chinese prisoners without their consent .
he was fined for using the title " professor " but acquitted on all other charges . the bottom line von hagens may come with controversy , but many say that is irrelevant for a town such as guben and its unemployed residents , such as ilona wolfram . a former nurse , wolfram worked in the former textile factory where the plastinarium has been established until it closed in 1991 and has been unemployed ever since .
now she is going back to the factory and to a steady job . " i do n't have a problem with handling body parts of dead people , " she told the berliner zeitung .

now , in the small town of guben , on the polish border , visitors to von hagens ' latest venture can see a group of corpses playing cards in a scene taken from the newest james bond film , " casino royale . " dubbed dr. death by the newsmagazine der spiegel , von hagens ' " plastinarium , " which opened to the public on friday , is half workshop , half cadaver museum .
to many , it is the height of morbidity .
but to others in the town of guben , where it has opened in a disused wool factory , it might be the ticket to at least a small economic revival after years of decline . guben may achieve renown or notoriety for cadavers in the future .
but to residents , that 's no worse than being known as a one-time industrial center that is now marked by sky-high unemployment and a fast-shrinking population , as young people leave for greener pastures further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say that von hagens is exploiting the dead there , in the four-story renovated factory he bought last year , von hagens will preserve human bodies with polymers , a process he developed and dubbed " plastination . "
thousands of plastinated body parts will then be sold to universities and medical institutes . visitors , meanwhile , can view human cadavers and body parts in various states and poses -lrb- including the bond scene -rrb- as well as study corpses of animals , such as an elephant and a giraffe .
the center 's web site says people will be exposed to the history of anatomical studies , including processes and specimens , such as " bone preparation , vascular casts , body slides , individual organ plastinates as well as whole-body plastinates . " the plastinarium is expected to draw thousands daily , according to van hagens , and provide up to 200 jobs in this town of 23,000 in which every fifth person is unemployed . but that has n't silenced critics who complain that van hagens methods are immoral and unethical .
bodies and commodities dozens turned out for the grand opening thursday to protest the plastinarium , singing " we shall overcome " and some holding placards that condemned the exhibition .
" no economic development with corpses " read one . many of von hagen 's most vocal critics come from within the religious community .
in guben , a pastor , michael domke , has been a particularly vocal critic of van hagens ' center there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal carcasses are included in the new center " this is a place where human body parts are exploited as if they are commodities , " he said .
" von hagens wants to make money by exploiting the dead . " still , many are thrilled that von hagens has made the town his base , saying that the factory he bought sat empty in the years since reunification .
the " plastinator , " as he calls himself , has spent 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.4 million -rrb- renovating the factory . " thousands of people inquired for the 41 jobs we have filled so far .
polls show that 80 percent of guben 's residents are behind this , " he said , referring to a tns emnid poll von hagens ' institute commissioned .
around 78 percent of the 3,000 respondents supported a permanent exhibit of plastinated corpses , against 21 percent who rejected the idea . von hagens said he invited critics to come take a look but they have so far rejected his offer . " i understand why it makes some people uncomfortable , " he added .
" it forces people to confront our own mortality which is not easy . " courting controversy von hagens is no stranger to controversy .
it was during his time as a researcher at the university of heidelberg , in 1977 , that he developed a method of preserving cadavers .
the process replaces body fluids with an odorless , plastic polymer . eventually , von hagens noticed that preserved body parts or even whole bodies might be interesting to the public at large .
he began assembling cadavers in various poses - playing basketball or chess - with organs and muscles visible .
his traveling exhibition , body worlds , inflamed church officials and some municipal authorities where the exhibits were held who called them immoral and disrespectful to the dead . but despite the protests and occasional prayer vigils , almost 20 million viewers have seen his exhibits in germany , belgium , england , switzerland , austria , south korea and the united states since the mid-1990s .
" the goal has always been to use the corpses as an instrument to increase awareness and knowledge of anatomy , " von hagens said . " we are trying to democratize anatomy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory has sat empty for more than a decade but others see money being made off of pure sensationalism that has little to do with science or edification .
" it is one thing to create an exhibit of anatomy to educate the public , " said werner schlaeke , director of the german pathologists association .
" but to pose corpses with cigarettes in their mouth or playing chess is not of educational value - it is entertainment , done for money and publicity and it is shameful . " under fire von hagens has had to also defend his techniques for acquiring cadavers for plastination . in 2001 , he was accused of using a body from a russian prison camp , a charge he denied and was eventually dropped .
two years later , he appeared before the kyrgyzstan parliament to answer charges of obtaining bodies illegally from central asian state hospitals and prisons .
von hagens operates a plastination center both in the kyrgyzstani capital , bishkek , and in china . in 2004 in germany , he faced allegations of tax evasion , falsifying credentials and using the bodies of condemned chinese prisoners without their consent .
he was fined for using the title " professor " but acquitted on all other charges . the bottom line von hagens may come with controversy , but many say that is irrelevant for a town such as guben and its unemployed residents , such as ilona wolfram . a former nurse , wolfram worked in the former textile factory where the plastinarium has been established until it closed in 1991 and has been unemployed ever since .
now she is going back to the factory and to a steady job . " i do n't have a problem with handling body parts of dead people , " she told the berliner zeitung .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 20.11.2006 german town pins revival hopes on corpse workshop großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' dr. death ' opens a new center to process corpses a struggling eastern german town is now home to the " plastinarium , " a workshop set up by the controversial anatomist behind the " body world " exhibitions , where dissected human corpses were displayed in lifelike poses . anatomist gunther von hagens made a name for himself dissecting corpses , " plastinating " them , and exhibiting them - and their viscera - doing everything from riding a horse to playing chess .
now , in the small town of guben , on the polish border , visitors to von hagens ' latest venture can see a group of corpses playing cards in a scene taken from the newest james bond film , " casino royale . " dubbed dr. death by the newsmagazine der spiegel , von hagens ' " plastinarium , " which opened to the public on friday , is half workshop , half cadaver museum .
to many , it is the height of morbidity .
but to others in the town of guben , where it has opened in a disused wool factory , it might be the ticket to at least a small economic revival after years of decline . guben may achieve renown or notoriety for cadavers in the future .
but to residents , that 's no worse than being known as a one-time industrial center that is now marked by sky-high unemployment and a fast-shrinking population , as young people leave for greener pastures further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say that von hagens is exploiting the dead there , in the four-story renovated factory he bought last year , von hagens will preserve human bodies with polymers , a process he developed and dubbed " plastination . "
thousands of plastinated body parts will then be sold to universities and medical institutes . visitors , meanwhile , can view human cadavers and body parts in various states and poses -lrb- including the bond scene -rrb- as well as study corpses of animals , such as an elephant and a giraffe .
the center 's web site says people will be exposed to the history of anatomical studies , including processes and specimens , such as " bone preparation , vascular casts , body slides , individual organ plastinates as well as whole-body plastinates . " the plastinarium is expected to draw thousands daily , according to van hagens , and provide up to 200 jobs in this town of 23,000 in which every fifth person is unemployed . but that has n't silenced critics who complain that van hagens methods are immoral and unethical .
bodies and commodities dozens turned out for the grand opening thursday to protest the plastinarium , singing " we shall overcome " and some holding placards that condemned the exhibition .
" no economic development with corpses " read one . many of von hagen 's most vocal critics come from within the religious community .
in guben , a pastor , michael domke , has been a particularly vocal critic of van hagens ' center there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal carcasses are included in the new center " this is a place where human body parts are exploited as if they are commodities , " he said .
" von hagens wants to make money by exploiting the dead . " still , many are thrilled that von hagens has made the town his base , saying that the factory he bought sat empty in the years since reunification .
the " plastinator , " as he calls himself , has spent 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.4 million -rrb- renovating the factory . " thousands of people inquired for the 41 jobs we have filled so far .
polls show that 80 percent of guben 's residents are behind this , " he said , referring to a tns emnid poll von hagens ' institute commissioned .
around 78 percent of the 3,000 respondents supported a permanent exhibit of plastinated corpses , against 21 percent who rejected the idea . von hagens said he invited critics to come take a look but they have so far rejected his offer . " i understand why it makes some people uncomfortable , " he added .
" it forces people to confront our own mortality which is not easy . " courting controversy von hagens is no stranger to controversy .
it was during his time as a researcher at the university of heidelberg , in 1977 , that he developed a method of preserving cadavers .
the process replaces body fluids with an odorless , plastic polymer . eventually , von hagens noticed that preserved body parts or even whole bodies might be interesting to the public at large .
he began assembling cadavers in various poses - playing basketball or chess - with organs and muscles visible .
his traveling exhibition , body worlds , inflamed church officials and some municipal authorities where the exhibits were held who called them immoral and disrespectful to the dead . but despite the protests and occasional prayer vigils , almost 20 million viewers have seen his exhibits in germany , belgium , england , switzerland , austria , south korea and the united states since the mid-1990s .
" the goal has always been to use the corpses as an instrument to increase awareness and knowledge of anatomy , " von hagens said . " we are trying to democratize anatomy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory has sat empty for more than a decade but others see money being made off of pure sensationalism that has little to do with science or edification .
" it is one thing to create an exhibit of anatomy to educate the public , " said werner schlaeke , director of the german pathologists association .
" but to pose corpses with cigarettes in their mouth or playing chess is not of educational value - it is entertainment , done for money and publicity and it is shameful . " under fire von hagens has had to also defend his techniques for acquiring cadavers for plastination . in 2001 , he was accused of using a body from a russian prison camp , a charge he denied and was eventually dropped .
two years later , he appeared before the kyrgyzstan parliament to answer charges of obtaining bodies illegally from central asian state hospitals and prisons .
von hagens operates a plastination center both in the kyrgyzstani capital , bishkek , and in china . in 2004 in germany , he faced allegations of tax evasion , falsifying credentials and using the bodies of condemned chinese prisoners without their consent .
he was fined for using the title " professor " but acquitted on all other charges . the bottom line von hagens may come with controversy , but many say that is irrelevant for a town such as guben and its unemployed residents , such as ilona wolfram . a former nurse , wolfram worked in the former textile factory where the plastinarium has been established until it closed in 1991 and has been unemployed ever since .
now she is going back to the factory and to a steady job . " i do n't have a problem with handling body parts of dead people , " she told the berliner zeitung .

the unnamed official said allied commanders should be able to call the germans in the morning , asking for a battalion , and it should be there by the evening . he said washington was frustrated by the mandate restrictions which were confining several foreign armies to the sidelines of conflicts in southern afghanistan . us unhappy with obstacles the us defense official was quoted in reports as saying that he did not like these stumbling blocks and that such a restrictive policy showed no solidarity with those western troops fighting the taliban in the south of the country . at present , there are some 2,700 german troops in the north of afghanistan where they hold the command of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- contingent . however , us and some european nato member countries feel german troops should also be deployed in the more dangerous southern parts of afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato-led isaf troops are under german control in northern afghanistan ' germany has played a big part already ' martin schulz , leader of the social democrats in the european parliament , rejected the us criticism which had also been echoed more recently by nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . schulz insisted german troops have been doing a great job in the north , where they have played a significant role in reconstruction efforts and contributing to resolving the conflicts , and this is where they should stay . he added that german has been active in " many peace-keeping missions abroad , " and resources can only go so far . " we have a large contingent on the balkans , we 're part of the unifil mission in lebanon , and german troops are also at the horn of africa to prevent the smuggling of weapons by sea to terrorists , " schulz said .
" it 's justified to say that the german armed forces are taxed to their limits , and any criticism of their commitment in afghanistan is unfounded . " miliary efforts " not enough " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz says german troops have effectively continued to stabilize northern afganistan schulz admitted the situation in the south of the country was bordering on chaos but said military operations alone would not resolve the problem . " perhaps more troops are needed to fight the taliban in the south , but the karsai government is also called upon to ensure that the resources being pumped into the country do not end up in the pockets of warlords and are distributed more evenly , " schulz said . " what sense would it make to withdraw some of our northern troops who 've done a great job there , and deploy them in the south ?
this would only result in a partial destabilization in the north so that nothing would be gained by such a move , " he added . the us state department meanwhile has confirmed president george w. bush has raised the issue with german chancellor angela merkel . german defense minister franz josef jung said there will not be any change to germany 's afghanistan mandate . southern troop deployment a possibility but reacting to the pressure from washington , other conservative lawmakers have indicated a partial deployment of german troops in the south of afghanistan is no longer out of the question .
they have said that if the capabilities of the german troops are needed to rescue friendly forces in emergency situations in the south , then they should be dispatched there . eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's christian democrats , said up to 100 special forces soldiers could be deployed anywhere in the country at any given time but added this had not been requested for over a year . germany 's commitment to the afghanistan mission will be discussed at the nato summit in riga , latvia , on nov .

the unnamed official said allied commanders should be able to call the germans in the morning , asking for a battalion , and it should be there by the evening . he said washington was frustrated by the mandate restrictions which were confining several foreign armies to the sidelines of conflicts in southern afghanistan . us unhappy with obstacles the us defense official was quoted in reports as saying that he did not like these stumbling blocks and that such a restrictive policy showed no solidarity with those western troops fighting the taliban in the south of the country . at present , there are some 2,700 german troops in the north of afghanistan where they hold the command of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- contingent . however , us and some european nato member countries feel german troops should also be deployed in the more dangerous southern parts of afghanistan .

" we have a large contingent on the balkans , we 're part of the unifil mission in lebanon , and german troops are also at the horn of africa to prevent the smuggling of weapons by sea to terrorists , " schulz said .

" perhaps more troops are needed to fight the taliban in the south , but the karsai government is also called upon to ensure that the resources being pumped into the country do not end up in the pockets of warlords and are distributed more evenly , " schulz said . " what sense would it make to withdraw some of our northern troops who 've done a great job there , and deploy them in the south ?
this would only result in a partial destabilization in the north so that nothing would be gained by such a move , " he added . the us state department meanwhile has confirmed president george w. bush has raised the issue with german chancellor angela merkel . german defense minister franz josef jung said there will not be any change to germany 's afghanistan mandate . southern troop deployment a possibility but reacting to the pressure from washington , other conservative lawmakers have indicated a partial deployment of german troops in the south of afghanistan is no longer out of the question .

dw.world.de spoke with the council president lutz tillmanns . the german press council sets its goal as overseeing that journalists report accurately and working to stop discrimination and slander as well as preventing the press from using dishonest research methods .
the council , however , does not have the authority to impose sanctions and can only give out warnings and reprimands . the german press council started life in bonn in 1956 when a group of five publishers and five journalists were sitting around a pub table .
they wanted to make a stand against the federal press law .
at the time , the interior minister was planning to establish a federal press watchdog .
instead , the journalists and publishers set up their own . dw.world.de : what does the german press council do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council was founded by journalists and publishers in 1956 we defend press freedom , for example when official inquiries impact journalistic content .
we become involved when editorial offices are searched or when material is confiscated . we also become involved when there are issues such as journalists showing bias towards a particular brand or company in their work , in a deceptive and sneaky way .
or when it comes to questions of journalistic dependence , such as how far can a journalist 's relationship go .
or what are the problems concerning the protection of victims in the media .
in addition , we also work through between 600 and 800 individual complaints per year regarding individual articles . what are the issues surrounding press freedom in germany ?
does freedom of the press need to be protected in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press council in 2006 - struggles for press freedom are still continuing today press freedom and freedom of expression are enshrined in germany 's constitution , but still there are some questions that need to be resolved : how do journalists receive access to information ; who is obligated , in the government departments , to give out this information .
other issues include what happens when i receive information and want to protect my source , but the police or state prosecutors does n't consider that , what happens to press freedom then ? it is not uncommon that a journalist 's work is confiscated , and legal authorities try to find out the source or materials to then use this information in order to prosecute the case . these are points where press freedom is really pushed to the limit , and that 's when fine-tuning becomes necessary . why does the press council operate under voluntary controls , and not state control ? it would be counter-productive if we would provoke the state to tighten laws against the media .
the existence of the press council over the last 50 years has shown that the german federal government and states are very careful about the regulation of the press through laws .
i think it is right that the industry recognizes for itself that it has to work for its privileges and has to be responsible .
that is why is should be voluntary , because then there is no obligation to the state , and with the voluntary system we have greater recognition of our role . but what about with tabloid papers , such as the bild , what can an official reprimand really mean to such a media giant ? even the bild and its current editor-in-chief are annoyed when other media report that bild has been reprimanded .
they also have to print the reprimands in the paper themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild has been repremanded on various occassions complaint investigations several times a year also use considerable resources .
this means the editor-in-chief and the legal department and other departments have to address the issue .
if they could avoid complaints investigations by the press council , then they would surely do so . does the press council need to be able to give out stronger punishments ? i believe that we do n't need other punishments ; we need more effective self-control perhaps with more publicity , that we receive more response from the press .
the german president emphasized that in his speech today . what are the press council 's struggles for the future ? we will certainly be looking at the grey zone between journalism and pr .
we do that already , but we need to increase our efforts here .
the electronic press is also very important - the recognition that the code of ethics is valid for electronic press as well as printed press - that is the information that is professionally published in the internet . also the defense of freedom of the press .
when i think of how many editorial departments have been searched , how much material has been confiscated , such as at cicero magazine , or dresden 's morgenpost .
journalists have been listened to on the telephone .
there are continual injuries of the press freedom .
we have to stay on the ball and push for better regulations . kate hairsine interviewed lutz tillmanns -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reporters without borders fights censorship with online demo the international human rights organization reporters without borders is sponsoring a 24-hour cyber demonstration against internet censorship , starting tuesday , nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 20.11.2006 german press council celebrates 50 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press council members spend more time behind the microsphones than in front of them monday is the 50th anniversary of the german press council , an independent and self-regulating organization which was based on the british press council model .
dw.world.de spoke with the council president lutz tillmanns . the german press council sets its goal as overseeing that journalists report accurately and working to stop discrimination and slander as well as preventing the press from using dishonest research methods .
the council , however , does not have the authority to impose sanctions and can only give out warnings and reprimands . the german press council started life in bonn in 1956 when a group of five publishers and five journalists were sitting around a pub table .
they wanted to make a stand against the federal press law .
at the time , the interior minister was planning to establish a federal press watchdog .
instead , the journalists and publishers set up their own . dw.world.de : what does the german press council do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council was founded by journalists and publishers in 1956 we defend press freedom , for example when official inquiries impact journalistic content .
we become involved when editorial offices are searched or when material is confiscated . we also become involved when there are issues such as journalists showing bias towards a particular brand or company in their work , in a deceptive and sneaky way .
or when it comes to questions of journalistic dependence , such as how far can a journalist 's relationship go .
or what are the problems concerning the protection of victims in the media .
in addition , we also work through between 600 and 800 individual complaints per year regarding individual articles . what are the issues surrounding press freedom in germany ?
does freedom of the press need to be protected in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press council in 2006 - struggles for press freedom are still continuing today press freedom and freedom of expression are enshrined in germany 's constitution , but still there are some questions that need to be resolved : how do journalists receive access to information ; who is obligated , in the government departments , to give out this information .
other issues include what happens when i receive information and want to protect my source , but the police or state prosecutors does n't consider that , what happens to press freedom then ? it is not uncommon that a journalist 's work is confiscated , and legal authorities try to find out the source or materials to then use this information in order to prosecute the case . these are points where press freedom is really pushed to the limit , and that 's when fine-tuning becomes necessary . why does the press council operate under voluntary controls , and not state control ? it would be counter-productive if we would provoke the state to tighten laws against the media .
the existence of the press council over the last 50 years has shown that the german federal government and states are very careful about the regulation of the press through laws .

dw.world.de spoke with the council president lutz tillmanns . the german press council sets its goal as overseeing that journalists report accurately and working to stop discrimination and slander as well as preventing the press from using dishonest research methods .
the council , however , does not have the authority to impose sanctions and can only give out warnings and reprimands . the german press council started life in bonn in 1956 when a group of five publishers and five journalists were sitting around a pub table .
they wanted to make a stand against the federal press law .
at the time , the interior minister was planning to establish a federal press watchdog .
instead , the journalists and publishers set up their own . dw.world.de : what does the german press council do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council was founded by journalists and publishers in 1956 we defend press freedom , for example when official inquiries impact journalistic content .
we become involved when editorial offices are searched or when material is confiscated . we also become involved when there are issues such as journalists showing bias towards a particular brand or company in their work , in a deceptive and sneaky way .
or when it comes to questions of journalistic dependence , such as how far can a journalist 's relationship go .
or what are the problems concerning the protection of victims in the media .
in addition , we also work through between 600 and 800 individual complaints per year regarding individual articles . what are the issues surrounding press freedom in germany ?
does freedom of the press need to be protected in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press council in 2006 - struggles for press freedom are still continuing today press freedom and freedom of expression are enshrined in germany 's constitution , but still there are some questions that need to be resolved : how do journalists receive access to information ; who is obligated , in the government departments , to give out this information .
other issues include what happens when i receive information and want to protect my source , but the police or state prosecutors does n't consider that , what happens to press freedom then ? it is not uncommon that a journalist 's work is confiscated , and legal authorities try to find out the source or materials to then use this information in order to prosecute the case . these are points where press freedom is really pushed to the limit , and that 's when fine-tuning becomes necessary . why does the press council operate under voluntary controls , and not state control ? it would be counter-productive if we would provoke the state to tighten laws against the media .
the existence of the press council over the last 50 years has shown that the german federal government and states are very careful about the regulation of the press through laws .
i think it is right that the industry recognizes for itself that it has to work for its privileges and has to be responsible .
that is why is should be voluntary , because then there is no obligation to the state , and with the voluntary system we have greater recognition of our role . but what about with tabloid papers , such as the bild , what can an official reprimand really mean to such a media giant ? even the bild and its current editor-in-chief are annoyed when other media report that bild has been reprimanded .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 20.11.2006 german press council celebrates 50 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press council members spend more time behind the microsphones than in front of them monday is the 50th anniversary of the german press council , an independent and self-regulating organization which was based on the british press council model .
dw.world.de spoke with the council president lutz tillmanns . the german press council sets its goal as overseeing that journalists report accurately and working to stop discrimination and slander as well as preventing the press from using dishonest research methods .
the council , however , does not have the authority to impose sanctions and can only give out warnings and reprimands . the german press council started life in bonn in 1956 when a group of five publishers and five journalists were sitting around a pub table .
they wanted to make a stand against the federal press law .
at the time , the interior minister was planning to establish a federal press watchdog .
instead , the journalists and publishers set up their own . dw.world.de : what does the german press council do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council was founded by journalists and publishers in 1956 we defend press freedom , for example when official inquiries impact journalistic content .
we become involved when editorial offices are searched or when material is confiscated . we also become involved when there are issues such as journalists showing bias towards a particular brand or company in their work , in a deceptive and sneaky way .
or when it comes to questions of journalistic dependence , such as how far can a journalist 's relationship go .
or what are the problems concerning the protection of victims in the media .
in addition , we also work through between 600 and 800 individual complaints per year regarding individual articles . what are the issues surrounding press freedom in germany ?
does freedom of the press need to be protected in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press council in 2006 - struggles for press freedom are still continuing today press freedom and freedom of expression are enshrined in germany 's constitution , but still there are some questions that need to be resolved : how do journalists receive access to information ; who is obligated , in the government departments , to give out this information .
other issues include what happens when i receive information and want to protect my source , but the police or state prosecutors does n't consider that , what happens to press freedom then ? it is not uncommon that a journalist 's work is confiscated , and legal authorities try to find out the source or materials to then use this information in order to prosecute the case . these are points where press freedom is really pushed to the limit , and that 's when fine-tuning becomes necessary . why does the press council operate under voluntary controls , and not state control ? it would be counter-productive if we would provoke the state to tighten laws against the media .
the existence of the press council over the last 50 years has shown that the german federal government and states are very careful about the regulation of the press through laws .
i think it is right that the industry recognizes for itself that it has to work for its privileges and has to be responsible .
that is why is should be voluntary , because then there is no obligation to the state , and with the voluntary system we have greater recognition of our role . but what about with tabloid papers , such as the bild , what can an official reprimand really mean to such a media giant ? even the bild and its current editor-in-chief are annoyed when other media report that bild has been reprimanded .
they also have to print the reprimands in the paper themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild has been repremanded on various occassions complaint investigations several times a year also use considerable resources .
this means the editor-in-chief and the legal department and other departments have to address the issue .
if they could avoid complaints investigations by the press council , then they would surely do so . does the press council need to be able to give out stronger punishments ? i believe that we do n't need other punishments ; we need more effective self-control perhaps with more publicity , that we receive more response from the press .
the german president emphasized that in his speech today . what are the press council 's struggles for the future ? we will certainly be looking at the grey zone between journalism and pr .
we do that already , but we need to increase our efforts here .
the electronic press is also very important - the recognition that the code of ethics is valid for electronic press as well as printed press - that is the information that is professionally published in the internet . also the defense of freedom of the press .
when i think of how many editorial departments have been searched , how much material has been confiscated , such as at cicero magazine , or dresden 's morgenpost .
journalists have been listened to on the telephone .
there are continual injuries of the press freedom .
we have to stay on the ball and push for better regulations . kate hairsine interviewed lutz tillmanns -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reporters without borders fights censorship with online demo the international human rights organization reporters without borders is sponsoring a 24-hour cyber demonstration against internet censorship , starting tuesday , nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 20.11.2006 german town pins revival hopes on corpse workshop großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' dr. death ' opens a new center to process corpses a struggling eastern german town is now home to the " plastinarium , " a workshop set up by the controversial anatomist behind the " body world " exhibitions , where dissected human corpses were displayed in lifelike poses . anatomist gunther von hagens made a name for himself dissecting corpses , " plastinating " them , and exhibiting them - and their viscera - doing everything from riding a horse to playing chess .
now , in the small town of guben , on the polish border , visitors to von hagens ' latest venture can see a group of corpses playing cards in a scene taken from the newest james bond film , " casino royale . " dubbed dr. death by the newsmagazine der spiegel , von hagens ' " plastinarium , " which opened to the public on friday , is half workshop , half cadaver museum .
to many , it is the height of morbidity .
but to others in the town of guben , where it has opened in a disused wool factory , it might be the ticket to at least a small economic revival after years of decline . guben may achieve renown or notoriety for cadavers in the future .
but to residents , that 's no worse than being known as a one-time industrial center that is now marked by sky-high unemployment and a fast-shrinking population , as young people leave for greener pastures further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say that von hagens is exploiting the dead there , in the four-story renovated factory he bought last year , von hagens will preserve human bodies with polymers , a process he developed and dubbed " plastination . "
thousands of plastinated body parts will then be sold to universities and medical institutes . visitors , meanwhile , can view human cadavers and body parts in various states and poses -lrb- including the bond scene -rrb- as well as study corpses of animals , such as an elephant and a giraffe .
the center 's web site says people will be exposed to the history of anatomical studies , including processes and specimens , such as " bone preparation , vascular casts , body slides , individual organ plastinates as well as whole-body plastinates . " the plastinarium is expected to draw thousands daily , according to van hagens , and provide up to 200 jobs in this town of 23,000 in which every fifth person is unemployed . but that has n't silenced critics who complain that van hagens methods are immoral and unethical .
bodies and commodities dozens turned out for the grand opening thursday to protest the plastinarium , singing " we shall overcome " and some holding placards that condemned the exhibition .
" no economic development with corpses " read one . many of von hagen 's most vocal critics come from within the religious community .
in guben , a pastor , michael domke , has been a particularly vocal critic of van hagens ' center there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal carcasses are included in the new center " this is a place where human body parts are exploited as if they are commodities , " he said .
" von hagens wants to make money by exploiting the dead . " still , many are thrilled that von hagens has made the town his base , saying that the factory he bought sat empty in the years since reunification .
the " plastinator , " as he calls himself , has spent 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.4 million -rrb- renovating the factory . " thousands of people inquired for the 41 jobs we have filled so far .
polls show that 80 percent of guben 's residents are behind this , " he said , referring to a tns emnid poll von hagens ' institute commissioned .
around 78 percent of the 3,000 respondents supported a permanent exhibit of plastinated corpses , against 21 percent who rejected the idea . von hagens said he invited critics to come take a look but they have so far rejected his offer . " i understand why it makes some people uncomfortable , " he added .
" it forces people to confront our own mortality which is not easy . " courting controversy von hagens is no stranger to controversy .
it was during his time as a researcher at the university of heidelberg , in 1977 , that he developed a method of preserving cadavers .
the process replaces body fluids with an odorless , plastic polymer . eventually , von hagens noticed that preserved body parts or even whole bodies might be interesting to the public at large .
he began assembling cadavers in various poses - playing basketball or chess - with organs and muscles visible .
his traveling exhibition , body worlds , inflamed church officials and some municipal authorities where the exhibits were held who called them immoral and disrespectful to the dead . but despite the protests and occasional prayer vigils , almost 20 million viewers have seen his exhibits in germany , belgium , england , switzerland , austria , south korea and the united states since the mid-1990s .
" the goal has always been to use the corpses as an instrument to increase awareness and knowledge of anatomy , " von hagens said . " we are trying to democratize anatomy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory has sat empty for more than a decade but others see money being made off of pure sensationalism that has little to do with science or edification .
" it is one thing to create an exhibit of anatomy to educate the public , " said werner schlaeke , director of the german pathologists association .
" but to pose corpses with cigarettes in their mouth or playing chess is not of educational value - it is entertainment , done for money and publicity and it is shameful . " under fire von hagens has had to also defend his techniques for acquiring cadavers for plastination . in 2001 , he was accused of using a body from a russian prison camp , a charge he denied and was eventually dropped .
two years later , he appeared before the kyrgyzstan parliament to answer charges of obtaining bodies illegally from central asian state hospitals and prisons .
von hagens operates a plastination center both in the kyrgyzstani capital , bishkek , and in china . in 2004 in germany , he faced allegations of tax evasion , falsifying credentials and using the bodies of condemned chinese prisoners without their consent .
he was fined for using the title " professor " but acquitted on all other charges . the bottom line von hagens may come with controversy , but many say that is irrelevant for a town such as guben and its unemployed residents , such as ilona wolfram . a former nurse , wolfram worked in the former textile factory where the plastinarium has been established until it closed in 1991 and has been unemployed ever since .
now she is going back to the factory and to a steady job . " i do n't have a problem with handling body parts of dead people , " she told the berliner zeitung .
" it 's a job and there is nothing wrong with it .

dw.world.de spoke with the council president lutz tillmanns . the german press council sets its goal as overseeing that journalists report accurately and working to stop discrimination and slander as well as preventing the press from using dishonest research methods .
the council , however , does not have the authority to impose sanctions and can only give out warnings and reprimands . the german press council started life in bonn in 1956 when a group of five publishers and five journalists were sitting around a pub table .
they wanted to make a stand against the federal press law .
at the time , the interior minister was planning to establish a federal press watchdog .
instead , the journalists and publishers set up their own . dw.world.de : what does the german press council do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council was founded by journalists and publishers in 1956 we defend press freedom , for example when official inquiries impact journalistic content .
we become involved when editorial offices are searched or when material is confiscated . we also become involved when there are issues such as journalists showing bias towards a particular brand or company in their work , in a deceptive and sneaky way .
or when it comes to questions of journalistic dependence , such as how far can a journalist 's relationship go .
or what are the problems concerning the protection of victims in the media .
in addition , we also work through between 600 and 800 individual complaints per year regarding individual articles . what are the issues surrounding press freedom in germany ?
does freedom of the press need to be protected in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press council in 2006 - struggles for press freedom are still continuing today press freedom and freedom of expression are enshrined in germany 's constitution , but still there are some questions that need to be resolved : how do journalists receive access to information ; who is obligated , in the government departments , to give out this information .
other issues include what happens when i receive information and want to protect my source , but the police or state prosecutors does n't consider that , what happens to press freedom then ? it is not uncommon that a journalist 's work is confiscated , and legal authorities try to find out the source or materials to then use this information in order to prosecute the case . these are points where press freedom is really pushed to the limit , and that 's when fine-tuning becomes necessary . why does the press council operate under voluntary controls , and not state control ? it would be counter-productive if we would provoke the state to tighten laws against the media .
the existence of the press council over the last 50 years has shown that the german federal government and states are very careful about the regulation of the press through laws .
i think it is right that the industry recognizes for itself that it has to work for its privileges and has to be responsible .
that is why is should be voluntary , because then there is no obligation to the state , and with the voluntary system we have greater recognition of our role . but what about with tabloid papers , such as the bild , what can an official reprimand really mean to such a media giant ? even the bild and its current editor-in-chief are annoyed when other media report that bild has been reprimanded .
they also have to print the reprimands in the paper themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild has been repremanded on various occassions complaint investigations several times a year also use considerable resources .
this means the editor-in-chief and the legal department and other departments have to address the issue .
if they could avoid complaints investigations by the press council , then they would surely do so . does the press council need to be able to give out stronger punishments ? i believe that we do n't need other punishments ; we need more effective self-control perhaps with more publicity , that we receive more response from the press .
the german president emphasized that in his speech today . what are the press council 's struggles for the future ? we will certainly be looking at the grey zone between journalism and pr .
we do that already , but we need to increase our efforts here .
the electronic press is also very important - the recognition that the code of ethics is valid for electronic press as well as printed press - that is the information that is professionally published in the internet . also the defense of freedom of the press .
when i think of how many editorial departments have been searched , how much material has been confiscated , such as at cicero magazine , or dresden 's morgenpost .
journalists have been listened to on the telephone .
there are continual injuries of the press freedom .
we have to stay on the ball and push for better regulations . kate hairsine interviewed lutz tillmanns -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reporters without borders fights censorship with online demo the international human rights organization reporters without borders is sponsoring a 24-hour cyber demonstration against internet censorship , starting tuesday , nov .

dw.world.de spoke with the council president lutz tillmanns . the german press council sets its goal as overseeing that journalists report accurately and working to stop discrimination and slander as well as preventing the press from using dishonest research methods .
the council , however , does not have the authority to impose sanctions and can only give out warnings and reprimands . the german press council started life in bonn in 1956 when a group of five publishers and five journalists were sitting around a pub table .
they wanted to make a stand against the federal press law .
at the time , the interior minister was planning to establish a federal press watchdog .
instead , the journalists and publishers set up their own . dw.world.de : what does the german press council do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council was founded by journalists and publishers in 1956 we defend press freedom , for example when official inquiries impact journalistic content .
we become involved when editorial offices are searched or when material is confiscated . we also become involved when there are issues such as journalists showing bias towards a particular brand or company in their work , in a deceptive and sneaky way .
or when it comes to questions of journalistic dependence , such as how far can a journalist 's relationship go .
or what are the problems concerning the protection of victims in the media .
in addition , we also work through between 600 and 800 individual complaints per year regarding individual articles . what are the issues surrounding press freedom in germany ?
does freedom of the press need to be protected in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press council in 2006 - struggles for press freedom are still continuing today press freedom and freedom of expression are enshrined in germany 's constitution , but still there are some questions that need to be resolved : how do journalists receive access to information ; who is obligated , in the government departments , to give out this information .
other issues include what happens when i receive information and want to protect my source , but the police or state prosecutors does n't consider that , what happens to press freedom then ? it is not uncommon that a journalist 's work is confiscated , and legal authorities try to find out the source or materials to then use this information in order to prosecute the case . these are points where press freedom is really pushed to the limit , and that 's when fine-tuning becomes necessary . why does the press council operate under voluntary controls , and not state control ? it would be counter-productive if we would provoke the state to tighten laws against the media .
the existence of the press council over the last 50 years has shown that the german federal government and states are very careful about the regulation of the press through laws .
i think it is right that the industry recognizes for itself that it has to work for its privileges and has to be responsible .
that is why is should be voluntary , because then there is no obligation to the state , and with the voluntary system we have greater recognition of our role . but what about with tabloid papers , such as the bild , what can an official reprimand really mean to such a media giant ? even the bild and its current editor-in-chief are annoyed when other media report that bild has been reprimanded .
they also have to print the reprimands in the paper themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild has been repremanded on various occassions complaint investigations several times a year also use considerable resources .

now , in the small town of guben , on the polish border , visitors to von hagens ' latest venture can see a group of corpses playing cards in a scene taken from the newest james bond film , " casino royale . " dubbed dr. death by the newsmagazine der spiegel , von hagens ' " plastinarium , " which opened to the public on friday , is half workshop , half cadaver museum .
to many , it is the height of morbidity .
but to others in the town of guben , where it has opened in a disused wool factory , it might be the ticket to at least a small economic revival after years of decline . guben may achieve renown or notoriety for cadavers in the future .
but to residents , that 's no worse than being known as a one-time industrial center that is now marked by sky-high unemployment and a fast-shrinking population , as young people leave for greener pastures further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say that von hagens is exploiting the dead there , in the four-story renovated factory he bought last year , von hagens will preserve human bodies with polymers , a process he developed and dubbed " plastination . "
thousands of plastinated body parts will then be sold to universities and medical institutes . visitors , meanwhile , can view human cadavers and body parts in various states and poses -lrb- including the bond scene -rrb- as well as study corpses of animals , such as an elephant and a giraffe .
the center 's web site says people will be exposed to the history of anatomical studies , including processes and specimens , such as " bone preparation , vascular casts , body slides , individual organ plastinates as well as whole-body plastinates . " the plastinarium is expected to draw thousands daily , according to van hagens , and provide up to 200 jobs in this town of 23,000 in which every fifth person is unemployed . but that has n't silenced critics who complain that van hagens methods are immoral and unethical .
bodies and commodities dozens turned out for the grand opening thursday to protest the plastinarium , singing " we shall overcome " and some holding placards that condemned the exhibition .
" no economic development with corpses " read one . many of von hagen 's most vocal critics come from within the religious community .
in guben , a pastor , michael domke , has been a particularly vocal critic of van hagens ' center there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal carcasses are included in the new center " this is a place where human body parts are exploited as if they are commodities , " he said .
" von hagens wants to make money by exploiting the dead . " still , many are thrilled that von hagens has made the town his base , saying that the factory he bought sat empty in the years since reunification .
the " plastinator , " as he calls himself , has spent 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.4 million -rrb- renovating the factory . " thousands of people inquired for the 41 jobs we have filled so far .
polls show that 80 percent of guben 's residents are behind this , " he said , referring to a tns emnid poll von hagens ' institute commissioned .
around 78 percent of the 3,000 respondents supported a permanent exhibit of plastinated corpses , against 21 percent who rejected the idea . von hagens said he invited critics to come take a look but they have so far rejected his offer . " i understand why it makes some people uncomfortable , " he added .
" it forces people to confront our own mortality which is not easy . " courting controversy von hagens is no stranger to controversy .
it was during his time as a researcher at the university of heidelberg , in 1977 , that he developed a method of preserving cadavers .
the process replaces body fluids with an odorless , plastic polymer . eventually , von hagens noticed that preserved body parts or even whole bodies might be interesting to the public at large .
he began assembling cadavers in various poses - playing basketball or chess - with organs and muscles visible .
his traveling exhibition , body worlds , inflamed church officials and some municipal authorities where the exhibits were held who called them immoral and disrespectful to the dead . but despite the protests and occasional prayer vigils , almost 20 million viewers have seen his exhibits in germany , belgium , england , switzerland , austria , south korea and the united states since the mid-1990s .
" the goal has always been to use the corpses as an instrument to increase awareness and knowledge of anatomy , " von hagens said . " we are trying to democratize anatomy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory has sat empty for more than a decade but others see money being made off of pure sensationalism that has little to do with science or edification .
" it is one thing to create an exhibit of anatomy to educate the public , " said werner schlaeke , director of the german pathologists association .
" but to pose corpses with cigarettes in their mouth or playing chess is not of educational value - it is entertainment , done for money and publicity and it is shameful . " under fire von hagens has had to also defend his techniques for acquiring cadavers for plastination . in 2001 , he was accused of using a body from a russian prison camp , a charge he denied and was eventually dropped .
two years later , he appeared before the kyrgyzstan parliament to answer charges of obtaining bodies illegally from central asian state hospitals and prisons .
von hagens operates a plastination center both in the kyrgyzstani capital , bishkek , and in china . in 2004 in germany , he faced allegations of tax evasion , falsifying credentials and using the bodies of condemned chinese prisoners without their consent .
he was fined for using the title " professor " but acquitted on all other charges . the bottom line von hagens may come with controversy , but many say that is irrelevant for a town such as guben and its unemployed residents , such as ilona wolfram . a former nurse , wolfram worked in the former textile factory where the plastinarium has been established until it closed in 1991 and has been unemployed ever since .

now , in the small town of guben , on the polish border , visitors to von hagens ' latest venture can see a group of corpses playing cards in a scene taken from the newest james bond film , " casino royale . " dubbed dr. death by the newsmagazine der spiegel , von hagens ' " plastinarium , " which opened to the public on friday , is half workshop , half cadaver museum .
to many , it is the height of morbidity .
but to others in the town of guben , where it has opened in a disused wool factory , it might be the ticket to at least a small economic revival after years of decline . guben may achieve renown or notoriety for cadavers in the future .
but to residents , that 's no worse than being known as a one-time industrial center that is now marked by sky-high unemployment and a fast-shrinking population , as young people leave for greener pastures further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say that von hagens is exploiting the dead there , in the four-story renovated factory he bought last year , von hagens will preserve human bodies with polymers , a process he developed and dubbed " plastination . "
thousands of plastinated body parts will then be sold to universities and medical institutes . visitors , meanwhile , can view human cadavers and body parts in various states and poses -lrb- including the bond scene -rrb- as well as study corpses of animals , such as an elephant and a giraffe .
the center 's web site says people will be exposed to the history of anatomical studies , including processes and specimens , such as " bone preparation , vascular casts , body slides , individual organ plastinates as well as whole-body plastinates . " the plastinarium is expected to draw thousands daily , according to van hagens , and provide up to 200 jobs in this town of 23,000 in which every fifth person is unemployed . but that has n't silenced critics who complain that van hagens methods are immoral and unethical .
bodies and commodities dozens turned out for the grand opening thursday to protest the plastinarium , singing " we shall overcome " and some holding placards that condemned the exhibition .
" no economic development with corpses " read one . many of von hagen 's most vocal critics come from within the religious community .
in guben , a pastor , michael domke , has been a particularly vocal critic of van hagens ' center there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal carcasses are included in the new center " this is a place where human body parts are exploited as if they are commodities , " he said .
" von hagens wants to make money by exploiting the dead . " still , many are thrilled that von hagens has made the town his base , saying that the factory he bought sat empty in the years since reunification .
the " plastinator , " as he calls himself , has spent 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.4 million -rrb- renovating the factory . " thousands of people inquired for the 41 jobs we have filled so far .
polls show that 80 percent of guben 's residents are behind this , " he said , referring to a tns emnid poll von hagens ' institute commissioned .
around 78 percent of the 3,000 respondents supported a permanent exhibit of plastinated corpses , against 21 percent who rejected the idea . von hagens said he invited critics to come take a look but they have so far rejected his offer . " i understand why it makes some people uncomfortable , " he added .
" it forces people to confront our own mortality which is not easy . " courting controversy von hagens is no stranger to controversy .
it was during his time as a researcher at the university of heidelberg , in 1977 , that he developed a method of preserving cadavers .
the process replaces body fluids with an odorless , plastic polymer . eventually , von hagens noticed that preserved body parts or even whole bodies might be interesting to the public at large .
he began assembling cadavers in various poses - playing basketball or chess - with organs and muscles visible .
his traveling exhibition , body worlds , inflamed church officials and some municipal authorities where the exhibits were held who called them immoral and disrespectful to the dead . but despite the protests and occasional prayer vigils , almost 20 million viewers have seen his exhibits in germany , belgium , england , switzerland , austria , south korea and the united states since the mid-1990s .
" the goal has always been to use the corpses as an instrument to increase awareness and knowledge of anatomy , " von hagens said . " we are trying to democratize anatomy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory has sat empty for more than a decade but others see money being made off of pure sensationalism that has little to do with science or edification .
" it is one thing to create an exhibit of anatomy to educate the public , " said werner schlaeke , director of the german pathologists association .
" but to pose corpses with cigarettes in their mouth or playing chess is not of educational value - it is entertainment , done for money and publicity and it is shameful . " under fire von hagens has had to also defend his techniques for acquiring cadavers for plastination . in 2001 , he was accused of using a body from a russian prison camp , a charge he denied and was eventually dropped .
two years later , he appeared before the kyrgyzstan parliament to answer charges of obtaining bodies illegally from central asian state hospitals and prisons .
von hagens operates a plastination center both in the kyrgyzstani capital , bishkek , and in china . in 2004 in germany , he faced allegations of tax evasion , falsifying credentials and using the bodies of condemned chinese prisoners without their consent .
he was fined for using the title " professor " but acquitted on all other charges . the bottom line von hagens may come with controversy , but many say that is irrelevant for a town such as guben and its unemployed residents , such as ilona wolfram . a former nurse , wolfram worked in the former textile factory where the plastinarium has been established until it closed in 1991 and has been unemployed ever since .
now she is going back to the factory and to a steady job . " i do n't have a problem with handling body parts of dead people , " she told the berliner zeitung .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 20.11.2006 german press council celebrates 50 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press council members spend more time behind the microsphones than in front of them monday is the 50th anniversary of the german press council , an independent and self-regulating organization which was based on the british press council model .
dw.world.de spoke with the council president lutz tillmanns . the german press council sets its goal as overseeing that journalists report accurately and working to stop discrimination and slander as well as preventing the press from using dishonest research methods .
the council , however , does not have the authority to impose sanctions and can only give out warnings and reprimands . the german press council started life in bonn in 1956 when a group of five publishers and five journalists were sitting around a pub table .
they wanted to make a stand against the federal press law .
at the time , the interior minister was planning to establish a federal press watchdog .
instead , the journalists and publishers set up their own . dw.world.de : what does the german press council do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council was founded by journalists and publishers in 1956 we defend press freedom , for example when official inquiries impact journalistic content .
we become involved when editorial offices are searched or when material is confiscated . we also become involved when there are issues such as journalists showing bias towards a particular brand or company in their work , in a deceptive and sneaky way .
or when it comes to questions of journalistic dependence , such as how far can a journalist 's relationship go .
or what are the problems concerning the protection of victims in the media .
in addition , we also work through between 600 and 800 individual complaints per year regarding individual articles . what are the issues surrounding press freedom in germany ?
does freedom of the press need to be protected in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press council in 2006 - struggles for press freedom are still continuing today press freedom and freedom of expression are enshrined in germany 's constitution , but still there are some questions that need to be resolved : how do journalists receive access to information ; who is obligated , in the government departments , to give out this information .
other issues include what happens when i receive information and want to protect my source , but the police or state prosecutors does n't consider that , what happens to press freedom then ? it is not uncommon that a journalist 's work is confiscated , and legal authorities try to find out the source or materials to then use this information in order to prosecute the case . these are points where press freedom is really pushed to the limit , and that 's when fine-tuning becomes necessary . why does the press council operate under voluntary controls , and not state control ? it would be counter-productive if we would provoke the state to tighten laws against the media .
the existence of the press council over the last 50 years has shown that the german federal government and states are very careful about the regulation of the press through laws .
i think it is right that the industry recognizes for itself that it has to work for its privileges and has to be responsible .
that is why is should be voluntary , because then there is no obligation to the state , and with the voluntary system we have greater recognition of our role . but what about with tabloid papers , such as the bild , what can an official reprimand really mean to such a media giant ? even the bild and its current editor-in-chief are annoyed when other media report that bild has been reprimanded .
they also have to print the reprimands in the paper themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild has been repremanded on various occassions complaint investigations several times a year also use considerable resources .
this means the editor-in-chief and the legal department and other departments have to address the issue .
if they could avoid complaints investigations by the press council , then they would surely do so . does the press council need to be able to give out stronger punishments ? i believe that we do n't need other punishments ; we need more effective self-control perhaps with more publicity , that we receive more response from the press .
the german president emphasized that in his speech today . what are the press council 's struggles for the future ? we will certainly be looking at the grey zone between journalism and pr .
we do that already , but we need to increase our efforts here .
the electronic press is also very important - the recognition that the code of ethics is valid for electronic press as well as printed press - that is the information that is professionally published in the internet . also the defense of freedom of the press .
when i think of how many editorial departments have been searched , how much material has been confiscated , such as at cicero magazine , or dresden 's morgenpost .
journalists have been listened to on the telephone .
there are continual injuries of the press freedom .
we have to stay on the ball and push for better regulations . kate hairsine interviewed lutz tillmanns -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reporters without borders fights censorship with online demo the international human rights organization reporters without borders is sponsoring a 24-hour cyber demonstration against internet censorship , starting tuesday , nov .

the unnamed official said allied commanders should be able to call the germans in the morning , asking for a battalion , and it should be there by the evening . he said washington was frustrated by the mandate restrictions which were confining several foreign armies to the sidelines of conflicts in southern afghanistan . us unhappy with obstacles the us defense official was quoted in reports as saying that he did not like these stumbling blocks and that such a restrictive policy showed no solidarity with those western troops fighting the taliban in the south of the country . at present , there are some 2,700 german troops in the north of afghanistan where they hold the command of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- contingent . however , us and some european nato member countries feel german troops should also be deployed in the more dangerous southern parts of afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato-led isaf troops are under german control in northern afghanistan ' germany has played a big part already ' martin schulz , leader of the social democrats in the european parliament , rejected the us criticism which had also been echoed more recently by nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . schulz insisted german troops have been doing a great job in the north , where they have played a significant role in reconstruction efforts and contributing to resolving the conflicts , and this is where they should stay . he added that german has been active in " many peace-keeping missions abroad , " and resources can only go so far . " we have a large contingent on the balkans , we 're part of the unifil mission in lebanon , and german troops are also at the horn of africa to prevent the smuggling of weapons by sea to terrorists , " schulz said .
" it 's justified to say that the german armed forces are taxed to their limits , and any criticism of their commitment in afghanistan is unfounded . " miliary efforts " not enough " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz says german troops have effectively continued to stabilize northern afganistan schulz admitted the situation in the south of the country was bordering on chaos but said military operations alone would not resolve the problem . " perhaps more troops are needed to fight the taliban in the south , but the karsai government is also called upon to ensure that the resources being pumped into the country do not end up in the pockets of warlords and are distributed more evenly , " schulz said . " what sense would it make to withdraw some of our northern troops who 've done a great job there , and deploy them in the south ?
this would only result in a partial destabilization in the north so that nothing would be gained by such a move , " he added . the us state department meanwhile has confirmed president george w. bush has raised the issue with german chancellor angela merkel . german defense minister franz josef jung said there will not be any change to germany 's afghanistan mandate . southern troop deployment a possibility but reacting to the pressure from washington , other conservative lawmakers have indicated a partial deployment of german troops in the south of afghanistan is no longer out of the question .
they have said that if the capabilities of the german troops are needed to rescue friendly forces in emergency situations in the south , then they should be dispatched there . eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for merkel 's christian democrats , said up to 100 special forces soldiers could be deployed anywhere in the country at any given time but added this had not been requested for over a year . germany 's commitment to the afghanistan mission will be discussed at the nato summit in riga , latvia , on nov .

the unnamed official said allied commanders should be able to call the germans in the morning , asking for a battalion , and it should be there by the evening . he said washington was frustrated by the mandate restrictions which were confining several foreign armies to the sidelines of conflicts in southern afghanistan . us unhappy with obstacles the us defense official was quoted in reports as saying that he did not like these stumbling blocks and that such a restrictive policy showed no solidarity with those western troops fighting the taliban in the south of the country . at present , there are some 2,700 german troops in the north of afghanistan where they hold the command of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- contingent . however , us and some european nato member countries feel german troops should also be deployed in the more dangerous southern parts of afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato-led isaf troops are under german control in northern afghanistan ' germany has played a big part already ' martin schulz , leader of the social democrats in the european parliament , rejected the us criticism which had also been echoed more recently by nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . schulz insisted german troops have been doing a great job in the north , where they have played a significant role in reconstruction efforts and contributing to resolving the conflicts , and this is where they should stay . he added that german has been active in " many peace-keeping missions abroad , " and resources can only go so far . " we have a large contingent on the balkans , we 're part of the unifil mission in lebanon , and german troops are also at the horn of africa to prevent the smuggling of weapons by sea to terrorists , " schulz said .
" it 's justified to say that the german armed forces are taxed to their limits , and any criticism of their commitment in afghanistan is unfounded . " miliary efforts " not enough " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz says german troops have effectively continued to stabilize northern afganistan schulz admitted the situation in the south of the country was bordering on chaos but said military operations alone would not resolve the problem . " perhaps more troops are needed to fight the taliban in the south , but the karsai government is also called upon to ensure that the resources being pumped into the country do not end up in the pockets of warlords and are distributed more evenly , " schulz said . " what sense would it make to withdraw some of our northern troops who 've done a great job there , and deploy them in the south ?
this would only result in a partial destabilization in the north so that nothing would be gained by such a move , " he added . the us state department meanwhile has confirmed president george w. bush has raised the issue with german chancellor angela merkel . german defense minister franz josef jung said there will not be any change to germany 's afghanistan mandate . southern troop deployment a possibility but reacting to the pressure from washington , other conservative lawmakers have indicated a partial deployment of german troops in the south of afghanistan is no longer out of the question .

the unnamed official said allied commanders should be able to call the germans in the morning , asking for a battalion , and it should be there by the evening . he said washington was frustrated by the mandate restrictions which were confining several foreign armies to the sidelines of conflicts in southern afghanistan . us unhappy with obstacles the us defense official was quoted in reports as saying that he did not like these stumbling blocks and that such a restrictive policy showed no solidarity with those western troops fighting the taliban in the south of the country . at present , there are some 2,700 german troops in the north of afghanistan where they hold the command of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- contingent . however , us and some european nato member countries feel german troops should also be deployed in the more dangerous southern parts of afghanistan .

now , in the small town of guben , on the polish border , visitors to von hagens ' latest venture can see a group of corpses playing cards in a scene taken from the newest james bond film , " casino royale . " dubbed dr. death by the newsmagazine der spiegel , von hagens ' " plastinarium , " which opened to the public on friday , is half workshop , half cadaver museum .
to many , it is the height of morbidity .
but to others in the town of guben , where it has opened in a disused wool factory , it might be the ticket to at least a small economic revival after years of decline . guben may achieve renown or notoriety for cadavers in the future .
but to residents , that 's no worse than being known as a one-time industrial center that is now marked by sky-high unemployment and a fast-shrinking population , as young people leave for greener pastures further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say that von hagens is exploiting the dead there , in the four-story renovated factory he bought last year , von hagens will preserve human bodies with polymers , a process he developed and dubbed " plastination . "
thousands of plastinated body parts will then be sold to universities and medical institutes . visitors , meanwhile , can view human cadavers and body parts in various states and poses -lrb- including the bond scene -rrb- as well as study corpses of animals , such as an elephant and a giraffe .
the center 's web site says people will be exposed to the history of anatomical studies , including processes and specimens , such as " bone preparation , vascular casts , body slides , individual organ plastinates as well as whole-body plastinates . " the plastinarium is expected to draw thousands daily , according to van hagens , and provide up to 200 jobs in this town of 23,000 in which every fifth person is unemployed . but that has n't silenced critics who complain that van hagens methods are immoral and unethical .
bodies and commodities dozens turned out for the grand opening thursday to protest the plastinarium , singing " we shall overcome " and some holding placards that condemned the exhibition .
" no economic development with corpses " read one . many of von hagen 's most vocal critics come from within the religious community .
in guben , a pastor , michael domke , has been a particularly vocal critic of van hagens ' center there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal carcasses are included in the new center " this is a place where human body parts are exploited as if they are commodities , " he said .
" von hagens wants to make money by exploiting the dead . " still , many are thrilled that von hagens has made the town his base , saying that the factory he bought sat empty in the years since reunification .
the " plastinator , " as he calls himself , has spent 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.4 million -rrb- renovating the factory . " thousands of people inquired for the 41 jobs we have filled so far .
polls show that 80 percent of guben 's residents are behind this , " he said , referring to a tns emnid poll von hagens ' institute commissioned .
around 78 percent of the 3,000 respondents supported a permanent exhibit of plastinated corpses , against 21 percent who rejected the idea . von hagens said he invited critics to come take a look but they have so far rejected his offer . " i understand why it makes some people uncomfortable , " he added .
" it forces people to confront our own mortality which is not easy . " courting controversy von hagens is no stranger to controversy .
it was during his time as a researcher at the university of heidelberg , in 1977 , that he developed a method of preserving cadavers .
the process replaces body fluids with an odorless , plastic polymer . eventually , von hagens noticed that preserved body parts or even whole bodies might be interesting to the public at large .
he began assembling cadavers in various poses - playing basketball or chess - with organs and muscles visible .
his traveling exhibition , body worlds , inflamed church officials and some municipal authorities where the exhibits were held who called them immoral and disrespectful to the dead . but despite the protests and occasional prayer vigils , almost 20 million viewers have seen his exhibits in germany , belgium , england , switzerland , austria , south korea and the united states since the mid-1990s .
" the goal has always been to use the corpses as an instrument to increase awareness and knowledge of anatomy , " von hagens said . " we are trying to democratize anatomy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory has sat empty for more than a decade but others see money being made off of pure sensationalism that has little to do with science or edification .
" it is one thing to create an exhibit of anatomy to educate the public , " said werner schlaeke , director of the german pathologists association .
" but to pose corpses with cigarettes in their mouth or playing chess is not of educational value - it is entertainment , done for money and publicity and it is shameful . " under fire von hagens has had to also defend his techniques for acquiring cadavers for plastination . in 2001 , he was accused of using a body from a russian prison camp , a charge he denied and was eventually dropped .
two years later , he appeared before the kyrgyzstan parliament to answer charges of obtaining bodies illegally from central asian state hospitals and prisons .
von hagens operates a plastination center both in the kyrgyzstani capital , bishkek , and in china . in 2004 in germany , he faced allegations of tax evasion , falsifying credentials and using the bodies of condemned chinese prisoners without their consent .
he was fined for using the title " professor " but acquitted on all other charges . the bottom line von hagens may come with controversy , but many say that is irrelevant for a town such as guben and its unemployed residents , such as ilona wolfram . a former nurse , wolfram worked in the former textile factory where the plastinarium has been established until it closed in 1991 and has been unemployed ever since .
now she is going back to the factory and to a steady job . " i do n't have a problem with handling body parts of dead people , " she told the berliner zeitung .

now , in the small town of guben , on the polish border , visitors to von hagens ' latest venture can see a group of corpses playing cards in a scene taken from the newest james bond film , " casino royale . " dubbed dr. death by the newsmagazine der spiegel , von hagens ' " plastinarium , " which opened to the public on friday , is half workshop , half cadaver museum .
to many , it is the height of morbidity .
but to others in the town of guben , where it has opened in a disused wool factory , it might be the ticket to at least a small economic revival after years of decline . guben may achieve renown or notoriety for cadavers in the future .
but to residents , that 's no worse than being known as a one-time industrial center that is now marked by sky-high unemployment and a fast-shrinking population , as young people leave for greener pastures further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say that von hagens is exploiting the dead there , in the four-story renovated factory he bought last year , von hagens will preserve human bodies with polymers , a process he developed and dubbed " plastination . "
thousands of plastinated body parts will then be sold to universities and medical institutes . visitors , meanwhile , can view human cadavers and body parts in various states and poses -lrb- including the bond scene -rrb- as well as study corpses of animals , such as an elephant and a giraffe .
the center 's web site says people will be exposed to the history of anatomical studies , including processes and specimens , such as " bone preparation , vascular casts , body slides , individual organ plastinates as well as whole-body plastinates . " the plastinarium is expected to draw thousands daily , according to van hagens , and provide up to 200 jobs in this town of 23,000 in which every fifth person is unemployed . but that has n't silenced critics who complain that van hagens methods are immoral and unethical .
bodies and commodities dozens turned out for the grand opening thursday to protest the plastinarium , singing " we shall overcome " and some holding placards that condemned the exhibition .
" no economic development with corpses " read one . many of von hagen 's most vocal critics come from within the religious community .
in guben , a pastor , michael domke , has been a particularly vocal critic of van hagens ' center there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal carcasses are included in the new center " this is a place where human body parts are exploited as if they are commodities , " he said .
" von hagens wants to make money by exploiting the dead . " still , many are thrilled that von hagens has made the town his base , saying that the factory he bought sat empty in the years since reunification .
the " plastinator , " as he calls himself , has spent 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.4 million -rrb- renovating the factory . " thousands of people inquired for the 41 jobs we have filled so far .
polls show that 80 percent of guben 's residents are behind this , " he said , referring to a tns emnid poll von hagens ' institute commissioned .
around 78 percent of the 3,000 respondents supported a permanent exhibit of plastinated corpses , against 21 percent who rejected the idea . von hagens said he invited critics to come take a look but they have so far rejected his offer . " i understand why it makes some people uncomfortable , " he added .
" it forces people to confront our own mortality which is not easy . " courting controversy von hagens is no stranger to controversy .
it was during his time as a researcher at the university of heidelberg , in 1977 , that he developed a method of preserving cadavers .
the process replaces body fluids with an odorless , plastic polymer . eventually , von hagens noticed that preserved body parts or even whole bodies might be interesting to the public at large .
he began assembling cadavers in various poses - playing basketball or chess - with organs and muscles visible .
his traveling exhibition , body worlds , inflamed church officials and some municipal authorities where the exhibits were held who called them immoral and disrespectful to the dead . but despite the protests and occasional prayer vigils , almost 20 million viewers have seen his exhibits in germany , belgium , england , switzerland , austria , south korea and the united states since the mid-1990s .
" the goal has always been to use the corpses as an instrument to increase awareness and knowledge of anatomy , " von hagens said . " we are trying to democratize anatomy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory has sat empty for more than a decade but others see money being made off of pure sensationalism that has little to do with science or edification .
" it is one thing to create an exhibit of anatomy to educate the public , " said werner schlaeke , director of the german pathologists association .
" but to pose corpses with cigarettes in their mouth or playing chess is not of educational value - it is entertainment , done for money and publicity and it is shameful . " under fire von hagens has had to also defend his techniques for acquiring cadavers for plastination . in 2001 , he was accused of using a body from a russian prison camp , a charge he denied and was eventually dropped .
two years later , he appeared before the kyrgyzstan parliament to answer charges of obtaining bodies illegally from central asian state hospitals and prisons .
von hagens operates a plastination center both in the kyrgyzstani capital , bishkek , and in china . in 2004 in germany , he faced allegations of tax evasion , falsifying credentials and using the bodies of condemned chinese prisoners without their consent .
he was fined for using the title " professor " but acquitted on all other charges . the bottom line von hagens may come with controversy , but many say that is irrelevant for a town such as guben and its unemployed residents , such as ilona wolfram . a former nurse , wolfram worked in the former textile factory where the plastinarium has been established until it closed in 1991 and has been unemployed ever since .
now she is going back to the factory and to a steady job . " i do n't have a problem with handling body parts of dead people , " she told the berliner zeitung .

now , in the small town of guben , on the polish border , visitors to von hagens ' latest venture can see a group of corpses playing cards in a scene taken from the newest james bond film , " casino royale . " dubbed dr. death by the newsmagazine der spiegel , von hagens ' " plastinarium , " which opened to the public on friday , is half workshop , half cadaver museum .
to many , it is the height of morbidity .
but to others in the town of guben , where it has opened in a disused wool factory , it might be the ticket to at least a small economic revival after years of decline . guben may achieve renown or notoriety for cadavers in the future .
but to residents , that 's no worse than being known as a one-time industrial center that is now marked by sky-high unemployment and a fast-shrinking population , as young people leave for greener pastures further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say that von hagens is exploiting the dead there , in the four-story renovated factory he bought last year , von hagens will preserve human bodies with polymers , a process he developed and dubbed " plastination . "
thousands of plastinated body parts will then be sold to universities and medical institutes . visitors , meanwhile , can view human cadavers and body parts in various states and poses -lrb- including the bond scene -rrb- as well as study corpses of animals , such as an elephant and a giraffe .
the center 's web site says people will be exposed to the history of anatomical studies , including processes and specimens , such as " bone preparation , vascular casts , body slides , individual organ plastinates as well as whole-body plastinates . " the plastinarium is expected to draw thousands daily , according to van hagens , and provide up to 200 jobs in this town of 23,000 in which every fifth person is unemployed . but that has n't silenced critics who complain that van hagens methods are immoral and unethical .
bodies and commodities dozens turned out for the grand opening thursday to protest the plastinarium , singing " we shall overcome " and some holding placards that condemned the exhibition .
" no economic development with corpses " read one . many of von hagen 's most vocal critics come from within the religious community .
in guben , a pastor , michael domke , has been a particularly vocal critic of van hagens ' center there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal carcasses are included in the new center " this is a place where human body parts are exploited as if they are commodities , " he said .
" von hagens wants to make money by exploiting the dead . " still , many are thrilled that von hagens has made the town his base , saying that the factory he bought sat empty in the years since reunification .
the " plastinator , " as he calls himself , has spent 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 4.4 million -rrb- renovating the factory . " thousands of people inquired for the 41 jobs we have filled so far .
polls show that 80 percent of guben 's residents are behind this , " he said , referring to a tns emnid poll von hagens ' institute commissioned .
around 78 percent of the 3,000 respondents supported a permanent exhibit of plastinated corpses , against 21 percent who rejected the idea . von hagens said he invited critics to come take a look but they have so far rejected his offer . " i understand why it makes some people uncomfortable , " he added .
" it forces people to confront our own mortality which is not easy . " courting controversy von hagens is no stranger to controversy .
it was during his time as a researcher at the university of heidelberg , in 1977 , that he developed a method of preserving cadavers .
the process replaces body fluids with an odorless , plastic polymer . eventually , von hagens noticed that preserved body parts or even whole bodies might be interesting to the public at large .
he began assembling cadavers in various poses - playing basketball or chess - with organs and muscles visible .
his traveling exhibition , body worlds , inflamed church officials and some municipal authorities where the exhibits were held who called them immoral and disrespectful to the dead . but despite the protests and occasional prayer vigils , almost 20 million viewers have seen his exhibits in germany , belgium , england , switzerland , austria , south korea and the united states since the mid-1990s .
" the goal has always been to use the corpses as an instrument to increase awareness and knowledge of anatomy , " von hagens said . " we are trying to democratize anatomy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory has sat empty for more than a decade but others see money being made off of pure sensationalism that has little to do with science or edification .
" it is one thing to create an exhibit of anatomy to educate the public , " said werner schlaeke , director of the german pathologists association .
" but to pose corpses with cigarettes in their mouth or playing chess is not of educational value - it is entertainment , done for money and publicity and it is shameful . " under fire von hagens has had to also defend his techniques for acquiring cadavers for plastination . in 2001 , he was accused of using a body from a russian prison camp , a charge he denied and was eventually dropped .
two years later , he appeared before the kyrgyzstan parliament to answer charges of obtaining bodies illegally from central asian state hospitals and prisons .
von hagens operates a plastination center both in the kyrgyzstani capital , bishkek , and in china . in 2004 in germany , he faced allegations of tax evasion , falsifying credentials and using the bodies of condemned chinese prisoners without their consent .
he was fined for using the title " professor " but acquitted on all other charges . the bottom line von hagens may come with controversy , but many say that is irrelevant for a town such as guben and its unemployed residents , such as ilona wolfram . a former nurse , wolfram worked in the former textile factory where the plastinarium has been established until it closed in 1991 and has been unemployed ever since .
now she is going back to the factory and to a steady job . " i do n't have a problem with handling body parts of dead people , " she told the berliner zeitung .

dw.world.de spoke with the council president lutz tillmanns . the german press council sets its goal as overseeing that journalists report accurately and working to stop discrimination and slander as well as preventing the press from using dishonest research methods .
the council , however , does not have the authority to impose sanctions and can only give out warnings and reprimands . the german press council started life in bonn in 1956 when a group of five publishers and five journalists were sitting around a pub table .
they wanted to make a stand against the federal press law .
at the time , the interior minister was planning to establish a federal press watchdog .
instead , the journalists and publishers set up their own . dw.world.de : what does the german press council do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council was founded by journalists and publishers in 1956 we defend press freedom , for example when official inquiries impact journalistic content .
we become involved when editorial offices are searched or when material is confiscated . we also become involved when there are issues such as journalists showing bias towards a particular brand or company in their work , in a deceptive and sneaky way .
or when it comes to questions of journalistic dependence , such as how far can a journalist 's relationship go .
or what are the problems concerning the protection of victims in the media .
in addition , we also work through between 600 and 800 individual complaints per year regarding individual articles . what are the issues surrounding press freedom in germany ?
does freedom of the press need to be protected in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press council in 2006 - struggles for press freedom are still continuing today press freedom and freedom of expression are enshrined in germany 's constitution , but still there are some questions that need to be resolved : how do journalists receive access to information ; who is obligated , in the government departments , to give out this information .
other issues include what happens when i receive information and want to protect my source , but the police or state prosecutors does n't consider that , what happens to press freedom then ? it is not uncommon that a journalist 's work is confiscated , and legal authorities try to find out the source or materials to then use this information in order to prosecute the case . these are points where press freedom is really pushed to the limit , and that 's when fine-tuning becomes necessary . why does the press council operate under voluntary controls , and not state control ? it would be counter-productive if we would provoke the state to tighten laws against the media .
the existence of the press council over the last 50 years has shown that the german federal government and states are very careful about the regulation of the press through laws .
i think it is right that the industry recognizes for itself that it has to work for its privileges and has to be responsible .
that is why is should be voluntary , because then there is no obligation to the state , and with the voluntary system we have greater recognition of our role . but what about with tabloid papers , such as the bild , what can an official reprimand really mean to such a media giant ? even the bild and its current editor-in-chief are annoyed when other media report that bild has been reprimanded .
they also have to print the reprimands in the paper themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild has been repremanded on various occassions complaint investigations several times a year also use considerable resources .
this means the editor-in-chief and the legal department and other departments have to address the issue .
if they could avoid complaints investigations by the press council , then they would surely do so . does the press council need to be able to give out stronger punishments ? i believe that we do n't need other punishments ; we need more effective self-control perhaps with more publicity , that we receive more response from the press .
the german president emphasized that in his speech today . what are the press council 's struggles for the future ? we will certainly be looking at the grey zone between journalism and pr .
we do that already , but we need to increase our efforts here .
the electronic press is also very important - the recognition that the code of ethics is valid for electronic press as well as printed press - that is the information that is professionally published in the internet . also the defense of freedom of the press .
when i think of how many editorial departments have been searched , how much material has been confiscated , such as at cicero magazine , or dresden 's morgenpost .
journalists have been listened to on the telephone .
there are continual injuries of the press freedom .

dw.world.de spoke with the council president lutz tillmanns . the german press council sets its goal as overseeing that journalists report accurately and working to stop discrimination and slander as well as preventing the press from using dishonest research methods .
the council , however , does not have the authority to impose sanctions and can only give out warnings and reprimands . the german press council started life in bonn in 1956 when a group of five publishers and five journalists were sitting around a pub table .
they wanted to make a stand against the federal press law .
at the time , the interior minister was planning to establish a federal press watchdog .
instead , the journalists and publishers set up their own . dw.world.de : what does the german press council do ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council was founded by journalists and publishers in 1956 we defend press freedom , for example when official inquiries impact journalistic content .
we become involved when editorial offices are searched or when material is confiscated . we also become involved when there are issues such as journalists showing bias towards a particular brand or company in their work , in a deceptive and sneaky way .
or when it comes to questions of journalistic dependence , such as how far can a journalist 's relationship go .
or what are the problems concerning the protection of victims in the media .
in addition , we also work through between 600 and 800 individual complaints per year regarding individual articles . what are the issues surrounding press freedom in germany ?
does freedom of the press need to be protected in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press council in 2006 - struggles for press freedom are still continuing today press freedom and freedom of expression are enshrined in germany 's constitution , but still there are some questions that need to be resolved : how do journalists receive access to information ; who is obligated , in the government departments , to give out this information .
other issues include what happens when i receive information and want to protect my source , but the police or state prosecutors does n't consider that , what happens to press freedom then ? it is not uncommon that a journalist 's work is confiscated , and legal authorities try to find out the source or materials to then use this information in order to prosecute the case . these are points where press freedom is really pushed to the limit , and that 's when fine-tuning becomes necessary . why does the press council operate under voluntary controls , and not state control ? it would be counter-productive if we would provoke the state to tighten laws against the media .
the existence of the press council over the last 50 years has shown that the german federal government and states are very careful about the regulation of the press through laws .
i think it is right that the industry recognizes for itself that it has to work for its privileges and has to be responsible .
that is why is should be voluntary , because then there is no obligation to the state , and with the voluntary system we have greater recognition of our role . but what about with tabloid papers , such as the bild , what can an official reprimand really mean to such a media giant ? even the bild and its current editor-in-chief are annoyed when other media report that bild has been reprimanded .
they also have to print the reprimands in the paper themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild has been repremanded on various occassions complaint investigations several times a year also use considerable resources .
this means the editor-in-chief and the legal department and other departments have to address the issue .
if they could avoid complaints investigations by the press council , then they would surely do so . does the press council need to be able to give out stronger punishments ? i believe that we do n't need other punishments ; we need more effective self-control perhaps with more publicity , that we receive more response from the press .
the german president emphasized that in his speech today . what are the press council 's struggles for the future ? we will certainly be looking at the grey zone between journalism and pr .
we do that already , but we need to increase our efforts here .
the electronic press is also very important - the recognition that the code of ethics is valid for electronic press as well as printed press - that is the information that is professionally published in the internet . also the defense of freedom of the press .
when i think of how many editorial departments have been searched , how much material has been confiscated , such as at cicero magazine , or dresden 's morgenpost .

a group of her classmates called her names and picked on her , saying she had a silly second name .
she was an easy target because she had moved classes at george mitchell school in leyton , east london , and was the new girl in the room .
" my friends told me to go and tell a teacher but i was n't confident enough to do that , " said the 14-year-old .
samira is now friends with the people who used to bully her instead she turned to a group of pupils set up within the school known as fab - fighting against bullies .
the fab pupils spoke to the people who had been making her miserable , explained the situation and got them to stop .
samira said : " they sorted it out for me and we became friends .
not best friends but enough for us to be nice to each other in class . "
these simple steps completely changed samira 's daily experience of school .
now she feels safe and free to get on with her lessons in peace .
but this was n't enough for her .
she wanted her fellow pupils to benefit from her experience and decided to join the other fab pupils in their battle against the bullies .
" i wanted to make a difference and stop other people from being bullied , " she explained .
and after some training in peer mentoring and role playing activities , that is exactly what she did .
it is very good to know that you are safe in school samira mohamed " now school is great .
it 's a really fantastic experience i am learning things every day .
" and it is very good to know that you are safe in school . "
members of fab act as a sort of school neighbourhood watch .
not only do they step in if they see someone being picked on , they keep an eye out for pupils sitting on their own or for anyone that looks upset .
" sometimes you might see someone crying so you go up and ask them what 's going on .
" maybe you get them a drink and they say that someone 's pushing them around , " said samira .
the fab members act as a sort of school neighbourhood watch she says half the time bullies do not even realise what they are doing .
" people do n't always show that they are upset because if you cry it 's like they have won , " she said .
this means the people who are doing the hurting do n't always know that they are being bullies , she added .
in these cases the fab members will go and let the bullies know that this is what they are being and this is sometimes enough to get the matter resolved .
' in control nathalie chambers , a citizenship teacher who co-ordinates fab at the school , said the system worked because it was the pupils who were completely in control .
" it 's something that the kids completely own .
" i hardly need to do anything .
i only need to get involved if a child is in danger , " she said .
" considering that a lot of the children involved are the ones that have been bullied - they are amazingly confident and bubbly . "
lindsay gilbert , who oversees peer mentoring schemes in schools around england for childline , said programmes like fab enlisted pupils natural sense of justice and encouraged them to be emotionally literate .
" as adults we are often in danger of doing something that we think will be good for young people opposed to doing what they want . "
" of course parents ' main concern is that their children achieve academically .
" but bullying can be really , really frightening and children wo n't be able to do that unless they feel safe and happy at school in the first place . "

a group of her classmates called her names and picked on her , saying she had a silly second name .
she was an easy target because she had moved classes at george mitchell school in leyton , east london , and was the new girl in the room .
" my friends told me to go and tell a teacher but i was n't confident enough to do that , " said the 14-year-old .
samira is now friends with the people who used to bully her instead she turned to a group of pupils set up within the school known as fab - fighting against bullies .
the fab pupils spoke to the people who had been making her miserable , explained the situation and got them to stop .
samira said : " they sorted it out for me and we became friends .
not best friends but enough for us to be nice to each other in class . "
these simple steps completely changed samira 's daily experience of school .
now she feels safe and free to get on with her lessons in peace .
but this was n't enough for her .
she wanted her fellow pupils to benefit from her experience and decided to join the other fab pupils in their battle against the bullies .
" i wanted to make a difference and stop other people from being bullied , " she explained .
and after some training in peer mentoring and role playing activities , that is exactly what she did .
it is very good to know that you are safe in school samira mohamed " now school is great .
it 's a really fantastic experience i am learning things every day .
" and it is very good to know that you are safe in school . "
members of fab act as a sort of school neighbourhood watch .
not only do they step in if they see someone being picked on , they keep an eye out for pupils sitting on their own or for anyone that looks upset .
" sometimes you might see someone crying so you go up and ask them what 's going on .
" maybe you get them a drink and they say that someone 's pushing them around , " said samira .
the fab members act as a sort of school neighbourhood watch she says half the time bullies do not even realise what they are doing .
" people do n't always show that they are upset because if you cry it 's like they have won , " she said .
this means the people who are doing the hurting do n't always know that they are being bullies , she added .
in these cases the fab members will go and let the bullies know that this is what they are being and this is sometimes enough to get the matter resolved .
' in control nathalie chambers , a citizenship teacher who co-ordinates fab at the school , said the system worked because it was the pupils who were completely in control .
" it 's something that the kids completely own .
" i hardly need to do anything .
i only need to get involved if a child is in danger , " she said .
" considering that a lot of the children involved are the ones that have been bullied - they are amazingly confident and bubbly . "
lindsay gilbert , who oversees peer mentoring schemes in schools around england for childline , said programmes like fab enlisted pupils natural sense of justice and encouraged them to be emotionally literate .
" as adults we are often in danger of doing something that we think will be good for young people opposed to doing what they want . "

but the bhf said the delay was costing lives .
when kay mccaw was having a heart attack , her first thought was not to cancel the viewing of a house she was hoping to buy .
she dismissed her early symptoms as indigestion and even as they grew worse she resisted dialling 999 .
her first call was to a friend who was coming with her to view the new house .
luckily for kay , 42 , from surrey , her friend was only minutes away and soon took charge of the situation , calling for an ambulance .
emergency " i still wanted to go and see the house .
" but my friend , who had watched her father have a heart attack , said she was going to get help , " said kay .
" she told me to lie down and stay calm - i was still thinking it was indigestion ! "
i can remember the monitors were going crazy " kay mccaw " but when the ambulance crew got to my house i can remember them calling in and saying they could not move me because my condition was so unstable .
" when i got to the accident and emergency unit i can remember the monitors were going crazy .
" my chest was exposed , but i did not care and i felt much worse . "
risks kay , who was only 40 at the time but who smoked and was overweight , spent a week in her local hospital before being transferred to st george 's hospital in south london for tests .
they showed that kay 's attack had been caused by an artery spasm due to stress .
" i had just left my husband and was busy at work and looking to buy a house .
it really was a stressful time . "
but kay , who has no family history of heart problems , said that despite being a smoker she had never considered herself at risk .
she has changed her lifestyle completely since her heart attack , changing her stressful job as a pa for a busy business to a job where she can work from home , stopping smoking , joining a gym and getting a dog that she can take for walks .
she said : " i feel well and healthy and now i try to avoid stress .
" i just think to myself ' can it kill me ? ' and if not then i think it is not worth bothering about . "
kay said it was important that people listened to their bodies and took action if something appeared to be wrong - even if they felt silly .
" it is always better to dial 999 if you have chest pains as delaying might cost you your life . "
she added : " had my friend not done something then i would not have called for an ambulance .
" i do suffer from indigestion and thought that is what it was .
" but the ambulance service said they would rather people ring than delay because it could be the difference between life and death . "

her first call was to a friend who was coming with her to view the new house .
luckily for kay , 42 , from surrey , her friend was only minutes away and soon took charge of the situation , calling for an ambulance .
emergency " i still wanted to go and see the house .
" but my friend , who had watched her father have a heart attack , said she was going to get help , " said kay .
" she told me to lie down and stay calm - i was still thinking it was indigestion !
i can remember the monitors were going crazy kay mccaw " but when the ambulance crew got to my house i can remember them calling in and saying they could not move me because my condition was so unstable .
" when i got to the accident and emergency unit i can remember the monitors were going crazy .
" my chest was exposed , but i did not care and i felt much worse . "
risks kay , who was only 40 at the time but who smoked and was overweight , spent a week in her local hospital before being transferred to st george 's hospital in south london for tests .
they showed that kay 's attack had been caused by an artery spasm due to stress .
" i had just left my husband and was busy at work and looking to buy a house .
it really was a stressful time . "
but kay , who has no family history of heart problems , said that despite being a smoker she had never considered herself at risk .
she has changed her lifestyle completely since her heart attack , changing her stressful job as a pa for a busy business to a job where she can work from home , stopping smoking , joining a gym and getting a dog that she can take for walks .
delays are costing lives she said : " i feel well and healthy and now i try to avoid stress .
" i just think to myself ' can it kill me ? ' and if not then i think it is not worth bothering about . "
kay said it was important that people listened to their bodies and took action if something appeared to be wrong - even if they felt silly .
" it is always better to dial 999 if you have chest pains as delaying might cost you your life . "
she added : " had my friend not done something then i would not have called for an ambulance .
" i do suffer from indigestion and thought that is what it was .
" but the ambulance service said they would rather people ring than delay because it could be the difference between life and death . "

jane tried breastfeeding , like many mums , but lilly struggled to feed .
jane persevered and , on the advice of medical staff , also introduced formula milk feeds in a bottle to help lilly get the nutrients she needed .
but things went from bad to worse .
jane recalls : " her face was really shiny and red and she refused to feed .
as soon as i reintroduced the milk she would get really sick again lilly 's mum jane bell " what she was getting down she would throw up again .
" her stools were really pungent and runny .
she constantly had diarrhoea .
other times they were like jelly .
her whole bottom was peeling where it was red raw .
" she also had a rasping to her breathing , like she was n't getting enough air . "
when lilly was eight weeks old , jane took her to a health visitor who told her that lilly was not gaining enough weight .
over the next weeks she went back and forth to the gp , who advised her that lilly most likely had a stomach upset - gastroenteritis .
jane began to notice that when lilly stopped having her bottle feeds because of her diarrhoea and vomiting , her symptoms started to improve .
exclusion diet " but as soon as i reintroduced the milk she would get really sick again , " jane explained .
this went on for about five months , then lilly 's gp referred her to see a hospital specialist .
lilly was switched to soya milk , but this did not help .
" she just got worse and worse .
then when she was eight months she got more and more sleepy and then one day i just could n't wake her up . "
lilly was rushed to hospital and when there the doctors looking after her suggested that she might have an allergy to the feeds she had been having .
in the uk , infant formulae and follow-on formulae are based on cows ' milk protein , hydrolysed protein or soya protein .
they prescribed lilly a special low-allergy or hypoallergenic formula milk .
turnaround " within two to three weeks the change was phenomenal .
she was so much better .
" but it took a long time for her immune system to calm down . "
lilly is now healthy and nine years old , but she still has to be careful about what she eats .
she is allergic to dairy products , eggs , soya and nuts .
she has to take tablets every day to keep her immune system in check and needs to carry an emergency injection of adrenaline around with her at all times in case she has a severe reaction to something she eats .
jane advised any parents who are concerned that their infant might have a food allergy to seek medical advice .
she added : " and if you are not happy with the advice , get a second opinion " it is hard for gps to diagnose .
the symptoms are not always the same .
but it is easy to track and simple to test .
try stopping the milk or food for a week or so and see if it helps . "

jane tried breastfeeding , like many mums , but lilly struggled to feed .
jane persevered and , on the advice of medical staff , also introduced formula milk feeds in a bottle to help lilly get the nutrients she needed .
but things went from bad to worse .
jane recalls : " her face was really shiny and red and she refused to feed .
as soon as i reintroduced the milk she would get really sick again lilly 's mum jane bell " what she was getting down she would throw up again .
" her stools were really pungent and runny .
she constantly had diarrhoea .
other times they were like jelly .
her whole bottom was peeling where it was red raw .
" she also had a rasping to her breathing , like she was n't getting enough air . "
when lilly was eight weeks old , jane took her to a health visitor who told her that lilly was not gaining enough weight .
over the next weeks she went back and forth to the gp , who advised her that lilly most likely had a stomach upset - gastroenteritis .
jane began to notice that when lilly stopped having her bottle feeds because of her diarrhoea and vomiting , her symptoms started to improve .
exclusion diet " but as soon as i reintroduced the milk she would get really sick again , " jane explained .
this went on for about five months , then lilly 's gp referred her to see a hospital specialist .
lilly was switched to soya milk , but this did not help .
" she just got worse and worse .
then when she was eight months she got more and more sleepy and then one day i just could n't wake her up . "
lilly was rushed to hospital and when there the doctors looking after her suggested that she might have an allergy to the feeds she had been having .
in the uk , infant formulae and follow-on formulae are based on cows ' milk protein , hydrolysed protein or soya protein .
they prescribed lilly a special low-allergy or hypoallergenic formula milk .
turnaround " within two to three weeks the change was phenomenal .
she was so much better .
" but it took a long time for her immune system to calm down . "
lilly is now healthy and nine years old , but she still has to be careful about what she eats .
she is allergic to dairy products , eggs , soya and nuts .
she has to take tablets every day to keep her immune system in check and needs to carry an emergency injection of adrenaline around with her at all times in case she has a severe reaction to something she eats .
jane advised any parents who are concerned that their infant might have a food allergy to seek medical advice .
she added : " and if you are not happy with the advice , get a second opinion " it is hard for gps to diagnose .
the symptoms are not always the same .
but it is easy to track and simple to test .

two high-profile murders , a crisis over relations with muslims and tensions with the eu shook the netherlands ' relaxed and confident outlook deeply .
but a strong economic recovery has lifted spirits , and sparked a remarkable political turnaround ahead of wednesday 's general election .
the centre-right christian democratic appeal -lrb- cda -rrb- party of prime minister jan peter balkenende is claiming credit for the revival , and appears to have been rewarded , with the latest polls suggesting it will come first in the election and lead the next government .
only in march the government 's unpopular policies led to a big win for the opposition labour party in local elections .
but cda spokesman marcel meyer says the austerity measures are now paying off .
" the economic position of the netherlands is very good .
economic growth is the largest in the eu , and unemployment is much less than four years ago , " he says .
" there is a direct relationship between the economic improvement and the rise in the polls . "
business leaders say that while the stimulus has been provided by increasing demand in the international economy , structural reforms enacted by the government have primed the netherlands to take advantage . "
now there is a feelgood factor ...
there 's been a fierce turnaround in the past few months " roalf van der kooy confederation of netherlands industry and employers roalf van der kooy , of the confederation of netherlands industry and employers , cites the " very bold steps " of cutting company taxes , opening healthcare to private competition , and strictly limiting benefits for unemployed and disabled people .
" flexibility in the social security system is much higher because of reforms , so you can pick up much more quickly when the economy picks up , " he says .
" now there is a feelgood factor - that 's one of the reasons why the pm and his party are doing so well .
there 's been a fierce turnaround in the past few months . "
he predicts that even if the labour party joins the next government , there will not be a change of tack now .
" the dirty job has been done for them . "
mutiny the " feelgood factor " is markedly different from the disillusionment evident in the netherlands in the past few years .
in the run-up to the 2002 poll , maverick populist pim fortuyn looked to be on the verge of taking power by playing on anti-immigration sentiment .
his murder , followed two years later by that of film-maker theo van gogh , left the dutch searching their souls for explanations and answers .
when the referendum on the eu constitution came round in 2005 , even committed pro-europeans joined the mutiny , delivering a resounding 61 % " no " .
but opinion polls suggest the rebellious mood has subsided , and that people will opt for the big parties , not the marginal ones .
labour party leader wouter bos hopes to rally enough support in the last few days to retake first place , or at least force his party into a " grand coalition " with the cda .
he says the government 's welfare cuts have meant the economy has expanded at the expense of the poor and the middle classes , while the rich have only gained .
" we want a more social netherlands , " says the party 's campaign manager marco esser .
" there is a big gap between the poor people and the better-off . "
' pyjama day ' he cites poor standards of care for the elderly as a problem the government " has done nothing about " .
staffing at government-funded care homes is so short , he says , that in some , only one in five residents is taken out in the open air once a month .
arno heltzel of the catholic union for the elderly , the netherlands ' biggest organisation for the aged , confirms that the situation in some facilities is desperate .
" in some homes they will announce a ' pyjama day ' , when people will not be helped into their clothes because there are not enough staff . "
he is angry , he says , because " in a rich country like the netherlands there are not enough resources to look after elderly people " .
polls suggest many left-wing voters dissatisfied with the government 's spending cuts seem to be ready to turn to the socialist party , rather than labour 's mr bos , whom they believe sounds too willing to jump into a coalition bed with the cda .
but the atmosphere for protest voting seems to have evaporated , and right-wing parties are unlikely to figure , says andy clark , political commentator for radio netherlands .
anti-immigration and pro-integration policies have now been adopted by the political mainstream , neutralising them as an issue .
" the sharp edges of the immigration debate have gone .
people want moves on integration , but see that this is being done , " says mr clark .
it would be wrong to say the netherlands ' self-confidence has returned , he says , as " the uncertainty is still there " .
" but some of the heat and passion has dissipated " .
after passing through a turbulent period , he says , " the dust has settled " .

" the dirty job has been done for them . "
mutiny the " feelgood factor " is markedly different from the disillusionment evident in the netherlands in the past few years .
in the run-up to the 2002 poll , maverick populist pim fortuyn looked to be on the verge of taking power by playing on anti-immigration sentiment .

when the referendum on the eu constitution came round in 2005 , even committed pro-europeans joined the mutiny , delivering a resounding 61 % " no " .

labour party leader wouter bos hopes to rally enough support in the last few days to retake first place , or at least force his party into a " grand coalition " with the cda .
he says the government 's welfare cuts have meant the economy has expanded at the expense of the poor and the middle classes , while the rich have only gained .

" there is a big gap between the poor people and the better-off . "
' pyjama day ' he cites poor standards of care for the elderly as a problem the government " has done nothing about " .
staffing at government-funded care homes is so short , he says , that in some , only one in five residents is taken out in the open air once a month .
care for the netherlands ' elderly is an election issue arno heltzel of the catholic union for the elderly , the netherlands ' biggest organisation for the aged , confirms that the situation in some facilities is desperate .
" in some homes they will announce a ' pyjama day ' , when people will not be helped into their clothes because there are not enough staff . "
he is angry , he says , because " in a rich country like the netherlands there are not enough resources to look after elderly people " .
polls suggest many left-wing voters dissatisfied with the government 's spending cuts seem to be ready to turn to the socialist party , rather than labour 's mr bos , whom they believe sounds too willing to jump into a coalition bed with the cda .
but the atmosphere for protest voting seems to have evaporated , and right-wing parties are unlikely to figure , says andy clark , political commentator for radio netherlands .
anti-immigration and pro-integration policies have now been adopted by the political mainstream , neutralising them as an issue .
" the sharp edges of the immigration debate have gone .
people want moves on integration , but see that this is being done , " says mr clark .
it would be wrong to say the netherlands ' self-confidence has returned , he says , as " the uncertainty is still there " .
" but some of the heat and passion has dissipated " .
after passing through a turbulent period , he says , " the dust has settled " .

conwy and denbighshire nhs trust said other hospitals could benefit from its " impressive " work to cut infection rates among intensive care patients .
better staff communication had helped cut the drugs budget by £ 78,000 , despite treating 350 more patients .
the nhs trust is to share its expertise with hospitals in south and north wales , and the north of england .
the trust , which runs glan clwyd hospital , said it had " changed the culture " of its organisation by concentrating on small but important changes in three areas - on the wards , before , during and after operations and in critical care .
since 2004 , the trust has worked with experts at the us-based institute for healthcare improvements , as part of the health foundation 's safer patients initiative .
it said worldwide research estimated that about one-in-10 patients experience unnecessary harm or suffering from mistakes in hospital .
virtually eliminated the trust has developed its own expertise to drive forward improvements so that these mistakes are difficult to make .
as well as lowering its rate of medical mistakes , glan clwyd hospital is reporting fewer infections .
pneumonia on the intensive care unit associated with assisted ventilation has been virtually eliminated from a previous level of 30 % .
gren kershaw , conwy and denbighshire nhs trust , said that because of the initiative the hospital was a " safer place for patients in north wales " .
he added : " the safety improvement work over the last two years has changed the culture of our organisation and has put the focus back on what really matters - providing the best and safest care for our patients .
" we 're proud of our achievements so far and we will continue to improve safety in our own hospital and further afield . "
the hospital has made small changes to ways of working some of the safety changes have had wider consequences .
for example , by reducing infections on the intensive care unit patients spend now less time in the unit and need fewer medications .
this has led to a £ 78,000 saving in the medicines ' budget although 350 more patients were treated over two years .
from monday the trust will work with other hospital partnerships which are joining the foundation 's safer patients initiative - including the university hospital of wales and the royal gwent hospital in south wales , and wrexham maelor and the countess of chester hospital .
stephen thornton , chief executive of the health foundation , said : " today marks an important step for us , the trust and the new hospitals that will learn from the inspirational work that has already taken place .
" together we will work hard to ensure that patients in wales and the uk receive the safest care possible . "

he added : " the safety improvement work over the last two years has changed the culture of our organisation and has put the focus back on what really matters - providing the best and safest care for our patients .
" we 're proud of our achievements so far and we will continue to improve safety in our own hospital and further afield . "
the hospital has made small changes to ways of working some of the safety changes have had wider consequences .
for example , by reducing infections on the intensive care unit patients spend now less time in the unit and need fewer medications .
this has led to a £ 78,000 saving in the medicines ' budget although 350 more patients were treated over two years .
from monday the trust will work with other hospital partnerships which are joining the foundation 's safer patients initiative - including the university hospital of wales and the royal gwent hospital in south wales , and wrexham maelor and the countess of chester hospital .
stephen thornton , chief executive of the health foundation , said : " today marks an important step for us , the trust and the new hospitals that will learn from the inspirational work that has already taken place .
" together we will work hard to ensure that patients in wales and the uk receive the safest care possible . "

the ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces in wales comes into force on 2 april 2007 .
a similar law is due to be introduced in england next summer .
health minister dr brian gibbons said he was delighted that many hotels and bars had already voluntarily introduced bans on lighting up .
up to 150,000 businesses and organisations will receive the letters from the assembly government .
dr gibbons said the business case for banning smoking was gaining ground and those introducing the bans were finding " positive impacts not only on their profit margins but also the health of their staff and customers alike " .
the assembly government says 400 people in wales die unnecessarily each year from the effects of inhaling second-hand smoke .
difficult decision the smoking ban is being introduced to reduce people 's exposure to second-hand smoke , and workers within the hospitality industry , which is traditionally associated with smoking and smoky atmospheres , should be among the key beneficiaries .
it will mean no lighting up at work , in pubs or clubs , although there will be some exemptions , such as hotel rooms .
martin morgan , owner of morgans hotel in swansea and the cawdor in llandeilo , both non-smoking , said they thought " long and hard " about taking that approach .
he said when morgans opened four years ago there were no other non-smoking establishment in swansea , so it was a difficult decision to make .
" at that point we had no idea of the impact on the business that the decision would make , but , it was something that we felt really strongly about , and when we decided to take that unique decision in swansea , we held our breath and waited for the response , " he said .
one hotelier says customers are happy to find they are smoke free staff have responded positively because it ensures they work in a clean environment , without any risk to their health , said mr morgan , and guests were " very happy to discover we are smoke free " .
stephen leeke , managing director of the vale hotel golf and spa resort in the vale of glamorgan , said they were looking forward to the introduction of the full smoking ban .
he said : " as the training ground for both welsh football and rugby squads , we are mindful of the need to keep our sporting stars in peak performance . "
" offering a convivial , smoke-free atmosphere can only add to this general feeling of wellbeing . "
wales is following the republic of ireland , norway , new zealand and scotland in banning smoking in public .

ever since it won the bid , the chinese capital has been straining every sinew to make the 2008 olympics the best ever .
the stadiums rising over the beijing skyline are cutting-edge , a firm statement about china 's growing confidence on the world stage .
and it is not just olympic architecture - subways , roads , railways and a huge new airport from one of the world 's top architects are also being built .
beijing is using the olympics to transform itself into a fitting capital for a 21st century superpower .
making up for lost time for the ruling communist party this is also an important re-branding exercise .
in pictures : beijing prepares for the 2008 olympics if it can demonstrate to its own public that beijing is accepted and respected on the international stage , and if it can persuade the world that - political corruption and repression notwithstanding - china is strong , rich and united , it wins twice over from the games .
a win on the field would be gratifying too .
arguments over taiwan kept chinese athletes out of the olympics until 1980 , but they have been making up for lost time .
china was only three gold medals behind the us in 2004 , and to come top on home turf would make beijing 's 2008 celebration complete .
sports chiefs have just told their athletes to cut out socialising and avoid all the lucrative distractions of advertising and self-promotion , so they can focus their energy on training .
critics mutter that china pushes its athletes too hard and still harbours drugs cheats in some sports .
but olympic gold medallist deng yaping told me china 's athletes are cleaner than most others , and that the authorities are determined to stamp out drugs altogether .
as for being bullied , she was picked as a future table tennis star at the age of five and spent 20 years inside the sports system .
she insists that it is the athletes who push themselves .
she says she got only encouragement from her coaches .
good impressions the public is in training too .
mass campaigns of self-improvement are under way , with schoolchildren taking part in olympic quizzes and essay competitions , and their parents are being urged to learn english and study books on etiquette .
china wants to make the best possible impression on the world in 2008 .
spitting , jostling , swearing or surliness will not be permitted .
when i carried out a random survey of beijingers in a vegetable market and on a bus , i did not find anyone complaining about all of this .
school day : china on friday 24 november bbc news will host live link-up between a school in beijing and a school in london , uk send your questions to pupils at a beijing school they said the games had helped modernise their city and boost the economy .
even the builders from southern china i found squatting at the roadside over a mug of rice and vegetables had more complaints about their lunch than the olympics .
they said the games would be a proud moment for the nation .
outside china , not everyone is convinced .
political and religious exiles argue that beijing should never have been awarded the olympics and that anyone who cares about human rights or democracy should boycott the 2008 event .
beijing 's backers say the opposite is true , that the olympics is opening china to the world in every field from sport to broadcasting and architecture .
the legacy of 2008 , they hope , will be not just stadiums , medals and fireworks , but a government which is more responsive to its own people .
carrie gracie will be reporting live from beijing 's olympic stadium at various times on tuesday morning .
you can see her reports on bbc news 24 , bbc world and bbc1 's breakfast .

the government has sold the bulk of its remaining stake , raising 15.5 billion australian dollars -lrb- $ 11.9bn ; £ 6.3bn -rrb- - twice what it expected .
telstra , a former monopoly , now estimates that one in 10 australians own shares in the company .
the newly-issued shares gained 9 % on their first day of trading .
the sale of the shares - the third tranche to be made available - was heavily oversubscribed .
investors cautious telstra 's value has halved since the last sale of shares in 1999 .
investors are cautious about the firm which is undergoing a five-year programme to modernise its business and shift away from traditional fixed-line services .
the telstra privatisation has been dogged by controversy , with opponents saying it could result in reduced rural services .
but supporters think it will make the company more competitive .
the sale meant that the government could play the role of regulator in australia 's telecoms industry without concerns over conflict of interest , finance minister nick minchin said .

the project , delayed by long legal battles , will receive a £ 14.5m grant from the assembly government and another £ 4m from finance wales .
the first phase - including 235 log cabins and a water park - will open in june 2008 .
but a friends of the earth spokeswoman said tourism in the county should focus on the area 's unspoilt coastline .
rebecca cadbury , who lives in narberth close to where the bluestone village will be built , said taxpayers ' money should not be used for developments like this .
" pembrokeshire 's main attractions are its unspoilt countryside , small rural towns and its magnificent coast .
i feel that what we need to see is tourist development that takes advantage of these , " she said .
we have been through a completely democratic process through planning that was successful william mcnamara bluestone chief executive " jobs have been used as a justification and there will be jobs - the problem is the nature of those jobs .
" they are likely to be seasonal -lsb- and -rsb- they are going to be poorly-paid jobs in the main . "
but bluestone chief executive william mcnamara said the company was creating a " year-round attraction " , so the work would not be seasonal .
" we have had an enormous positive response to the bluestone job opportunities , " he said .
" these are year-round jobs with progression and development opportunities including graduate placements to bring some very serious opportunities to local people . "
mr mcnamara told bbc wales construction would begin " in a matter of days " and said the company did not take lightly the responsibility of building within the pembrokeshire coast national park .
" we did n't ' get over ' the rules - we abided by the rules .
we have been through a completely democratic process through planning that was successful . "
bluestone hopes the holiday village - catering for the " more discerning visitor " will bring in up to 100,000 staying visitors a year .
the water park is in the first phase of the development it said the project will provide a completely different experience from anything else in the uk .
two all-weather attractions - a sub-tropical waterworld and snow centre - are also projected to bring another 250,000 day visitors each year .
enterprise minister andrew davies praised the project as " the ultimate indigenous sustainable business " .
signing the funding agreement with bluestone , the minister added : " the concept was conceived in wales , it will be developed in wales , delivered by welsh people , provide jobs for local people , benefit welsh businesses , and promote our distinct welsh culture and heritage internationally . "
other financial backers include mansford holdings plc and bank of scotland corporate , while pembrokeshire council is providing a loan .
the holiday village received clearance from the house of lords a year ago after opposition to the scheme by the council for national parks -lrb- cnp -rrb- was finally rejected .
part of bluestone will be built in the pembrokeshire coast national park and the cnp had claimed this would establish a precedent which could allow development on other uk protected parkland .
work on the snow centre and second phase of the development is scheduled for 2009 .

the project , delayed by long legal battles , will receive a £ 14.5m grant from the assembly government and another £ 4m from finance wales .
the first phase - including 235 log cabins and a water park - will open in june 2008 .
but a friends of the earth spokeswoman said tourism in the county should focus on the area 's unspoilt coastline .
rebecca cadbury , who lives in narberth close to where the bluestone village will be built , said taxpayers ' money should not be used for developments like this .
" pembrokeshire 's main attractions are its unspoilt countryside , small rural towns and its magnificent coast .
i feel that what we need to see is tourist development that takes advantage of these , " she said .
we have been through a completely democratic process through planning that was successful william mcnamara bluestone chief executive " jobs have been used as a justification and there will be jobs - the problem is the nature of those jobs .
" they are likely to be seasonal -lsb- and -rsb- they are going to be poorly-paid jobs in the main . "
but bluestone chief executive william mcnamara said the company was creating a " year-round attraction " , so the work would not be seasonal .
" we have had an enormous positive response to the bluestone job opportunities , " he said .
" these are year-round jobs with progression and development opportunities including graduate placements to bring some very serious opportunities to local people . "
mr mcnamara told bbc wales construction would begin " in a matter of days " and said the company did not take lightly the responsibility of building within the pembrokeshire coast national park .
" we did n't ' get over ' the rules - we abided by the rules .
we have been through a completely democratic process through planning that was successful . "
bluestone hopes the holiday village - catering for the " more discerning visitor " will bring in up to 100,000 staying visitors a year .
the water park is in the first phase of the development it said the project will provide a completely different experience from anything else in the uk .
two all-weather attractions - a sub-tropical waterworld and snow centre - are also projected to bring another 250,000 day visitors each year .
enterprise minister andrew davies praised the project as " the ultimate indigenous sustainable business " .
signing the funding agreement with bluestone , the minister added : " the concept was conceived in wales , it will be developed in wales , delivered by welsh people , provide jobs for local people , benefit welsh businesses , and promote our distinct welsh culture and heritage internationally . "
other financial backers include mansford holdings plc and bank of scotland corporate , while pembrokeshire council is providing a loan .
the holiday village received clearance from the house of lords a year ago after opposition to the scheme by the council for national parks -lrb- cnp -rrb- was finally rejected .
part of bluestone will be built in the pembrokeshire coast national park and the cnp had claimed this would establish a precedent which could allow development on other uk protected parkland .

i 'm sure you can guess how they went , " you 'll know the troubles are finally over for good when unarmed police officers can stroll through crossmaglen in south armagh on morning patrol ... " , that kind of thing .
well , by the same token you 'll know that the province has a normal property market when house-hunting couples no longer have to keep an eye open for the union jacks or irish tricolours on lamp-posts or the kerbstones painted in national colours which mark out different areas as " belonging " to one community or the other .
sense of separateness those tribal markings are not there simply to serve as aggressive and hostile celebrations of identity - they are clearly designed to ensure that no-one of " the wrong sort " would even consider moving in .
in other words , they consolidate sectarianism in the housing market . "

there are signs though , that all this could be beginning to change .
at enniskillen , in county fermanagh , a new red-brick development built in conjunction with a local housing association has been explicitly designed as a mixed community .
all the householders - catholic , protestant and eastern european - have signed up to a contract in which they agree there 'll be no fluttering flags or painted kerbstones .
carran crescent in effect , will be neutral ground .
one of the first residents , michelle irvine said simply : " i want to mix with all different kinds .
i do n't want to know whether they are protestant or catholic .
i 'm interested in whether they are a good neighbour or not . "
now admittedly , as signs of hope go , this is a fairly small one - 94 % of social housing in northern ireland is still effectively segregated along sectarian lines .
but it is hope nonetheless .
there are plans for integrated schemes in more small towns around the province , and even for a city centre area in belfast not far from the shankill road , one of the historic homes of uncompromising loyalism .
there 's no reason in theory why this kind of social experiment in the property sector ca n't act as a catalyst for change in the future , just as the drive for integrated education has had an impact -lrb- albeit a less than overwhelming impact -rrb- on northern ireland 's tradition of sectarian schooling .
significant hope we know that changes in housing policy can be a significant hope for the future precisely because we know what a significant role that the issue played in the past .
one of the cases which helped give the civil rights movement momentum in 1968 was a decision by a council in dungannon , county tyrone , to award a local-authority-owned house to the unmarried secretary of a protestant politician rather than to catholic families with children who were on the housing waiting list .
in the early 1970s , when sectarian violence appeared to be running out of control , tens of thousands of men , women and children were forced to move house , mainly in belfast , abandoning mixed streets in favour of safer areas where they could guarantee to be surrounded by ' their own ' .
northern ireland is more stable and more peaceful these days , and the residents of carran crescent are entitled to look to the future with optimism .
but there 's another sense too , in which stories about property these days in northern ireland have a more positive feel to them .
house prices in the province have been shooting up of late , even faster than those in britain .
the city of newry , just on the northern side of the irish border , recorded the highest rise of any individual town over the last 10 years - 371 % .
now of course , that 's not straightforward good news - there are issues about the affordability of homes for first-time buyers , and for lower-income families .
but for northern ireland it is good news - after all , it means that the news here these days , is pretty much like the news elsewhere in the property price-obsessed uk .

well , by the same token you 'll know that the province has a normal property market when house-hunting couples no longer have to keep an eye open for the union jacks or irish tricolours on lamp-posts or the kerbstones painted in national colours which mark out different areas as " belonging " to one community or the other .
sense of separateness those tribal markings are not there simply to serve as aggressive and hostile celebrations of identity - they are clearly designed to ensure that no-one of " the wrong sort " would even consider moving in .

there are signs though , that all this could be beginning to change .
at enniskillen , in county fermanagh , a new red-brick development built in conjunction with a local housing association has been explicitly designed as a mixed community .

one of the first residents , michelle irvine said simply : " i want to mix with all different kinds .
i do n't want to know whether they are protestant or catholic .
i 'm interested in whether they are a good neighbour or not . "
now admittedly , as signs of hope go , this is a fairly small one - 94 % of social housing in northern ireland is still effectively segregated along sectarian lines .
but it is hope nonetheless .
there are plans for integrated schemes in more small towns around the province , and even for a city centre area in belfast not far from the shankill road , one of the historic homes of uncompromising loyalism .
there 's no reason in theory why this kind of social experiment in the property sector ca n't act as a catalyst for change in the future , just as the drive for integrated education has had an impact -lrb- albeit a less than overwhelming impact -rrb- on northern ireland 's tradition of sectarian schooling .
significant hope we know that changes in housing policy can be a significant hope for the future precisely because we know what a significant role that the issue played in the past .
house prices have been rising quickly in the province one of the cases which helped give the civil rights movement momentum in 1968 was a decision by a council in dungannon , county tyrone , to award a local-authority-owned house to the unmarried secretary of a protestant politician rather than to catholic families with children who were on the housing waiting list .
in the early 1970s , when sectarian violence appeared to be running out of control , tens of thousands of men , women and children were forced to move house , mainly in belfast , abandoning mixed streets in favour of safer areas where they could guarantee to be surrounded by ' their own ' .
northern ireland is more stable and more peaceful these days , and the residents of carran crescent are entitled to look to the future with optimism .
but there 's another sense too , in which stories about property these days in northern ireland have a more positive feel to them .
house prices in the province have been shooting up of late , even faster than those in britain .
the city of newry , just on the northern side of the irish border , recorded the highest rise of any individual town over the last 10 years - 371 % .
now of course , that 's not straightforward good news - there are issues about the affordability of homes for first-time buyers , and for lower-income families .
but for northern ireland it is good news - after all , it means that the news here these days , is pretty much like the news elsewhere in the property price-obsessed uk .
