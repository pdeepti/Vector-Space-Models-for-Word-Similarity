its high profile and spectacular campaigns have ensured that greenpeace remains the most high profile environmental group on the planet . greenpeace has offices in 40 countries across europe , the americas , asia and the pacific , and established its german branch in hamburg in 1980 .
greenpeace has relied mostly on donations and membership fees to maintain its global reach and its ability to the stage protests anywhere in the world . now , however , the organization has to cut back on expenses .

as a result , costs will have to be reduced as of 2008 - and the largest cuts will be in the personnel sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.12.2006 german students with disabilities overcome college hurdles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students with disabilities need to leap various institutional hurdles a hearing impairment is no visible handicap , yet many hearing-impaired students in germany are hesitant to talk about it .
for some , the university is actually the first opportunity to meet other people with disabilities . according to a survey by the german student union , some 15 percent of german students have a disability or are chronically ill .
in addition to attending lectures , making photocopies and taking coffee breaks , students with disabilities also need to deal with a lot of administrative paperwork .
getting appropriate hearing aids , reading devices for the blind or transportation services for wheelchair users often necessitates an elaborate application process . " there is a large number of assistance options that are relatively independent of the kind of handicap , " said dr. maike gattermann-kasper , who advises handicapped and chronically ill students at the university of hamburg and helps them with their paperwork . " many students need special examination conditions .
we advise them and discuss how their special cases can be accommodated .
things do n't depend only on the handicap itself , but also on the requirements in the given subject or course of study , " she said . comparing notes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 15 percent of german students have a disability or are chronically ill there are around 20 deaf and numerous hearing-impaired students at the university of hamburg . some of them had never come into contact with other people with disabilities before coming to college . " only at the university did i actually meet other hearing-impaired students , " said zoe , a hearing-impaired student at the university of hamburg who had previously attended a regular high school . " i actually did n't have any contact with other hearing-impaired people before .
i did n't think that was so bad at the time , but now i think it 's really nice being able to compare notes with others , " she said . overcoming the disability deaf-mute or hearing-impaired students at the university of hamburg have interpreters who translate lectures and seminars into sign language .
additionally , students can request the service of a typist who can compile lecture notes for them or they can use special audio devices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may 2006 , germany passed a broad anti-discrimination law " i use an fm device in my studies , " zoe said .
" fm stands for frequency modulation .
it 's similar to a cell phone .
it has a transmitter , which is like a microphone that emits acoustic signals , or what is being said , to the hearing aid . " even though the system functions well , other students often forget to pass the microphone or the professor forgets to use one .
handicapped students are often reluctant to remind their colleagues or their teachers about the microphones , which sometimes means they can not follow discussions . challenging examinations disabilities are a particular challenge during examinations , even though students are given extensions for their exams or allowed to take them in separate rooms . " i did n't have to take any oral examination until now , " said anna , another hearing-impaired student , who is now preparing for her state examination in special education .
" my first oral will be a part of the state examination , and , in this case , i can ask for a quiet room , for instance . " many students , like anna , say that they are torn between not wanting to be treated as handicapped all the time and , on the other hand , often wishing that those around them were a little more mindful of their situation . " that 's why i like horse-back riding , " anna said .
" when i go riding , my hearing impediment or my disability are not in the foreground .
the main topic is the horse .
and the disability plays no role at all .

we advise them and discuss how their special cases can be accommodated .
things do n't depend only on the handicap itself , but also on the requirements in the given subject or course of study , " she said . comparing notes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 15 percent of german students have a disability or are chronically ill there are around 20 deaf and numerous hearing-impaired students at the university of hamburg . some of them had never come into contact with other people with disabilities before coming to college . " only at the university did i actually meet other hearing-impaired students , " said zoe , a hearing-impaired student at the university of hamburg who had previously attended a regular high school . " i actually did n't have any contact with other hearing-impaired people before .
i did n't think that was so bad at the time , but now i think it 's really nice being able to compare notes with others , " she said . overcoming the disability deaf-mute or hearing-impaired students at the university of hamburg have interpreters who translate lectures and seminars into sign language .
additionally , students can request the service of a typist who can compile lecture notes for them or they can use special audio devices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may 2006 , germany passed a broad anti-discrimination law " i use an fm device in my studies , " zoe said .
" fm stands for frequency modulation .
it 's similar to a cell phone .
it has a transmitter , which is like a microphone that emits acoustic signals , or what is being said , to the hearing aid . " even though the system functions well , other students often forget to pass the microphone or the professor forgets to use one .
handicapped students are often reluctant to remind their colleagues or their teachers about the microphones , which sometimes means they can not follow discussions . challenging examinations disabilities are a particular challenge during examinations , even though students are given extensions for their exams or allowed to take them in separate rooms . " i did n't have to take any oral examination until now , " said anna , another hearing-impaired student , who is now preparing for her state examination in special education .
" my first oral will be a part of the state examination , and , in this case , i can ask for a quiet room , for instance . " many students , like anna , say that they are torn between not wanting to be treated as handicapped all the time and , on the other hand , often wishing that those around them were a little more mindful of their situation . " that 's why i like horse-back riding , " anna said .
" when i go riding , my hearing impediment or my disability are not in the foreground .
the main topic is the horse .
and the disability plays no role at all .

despite surviving for 26 years , environmental organization greenpeace 's german branch is now experiencing a lack of funding which could make fighting the good fight even harder . the renowned environmental organization greenpeace focuses on the most crucial worldwide threats to the environment .
its high profile and spectacular campaigns have ensured that greenpeace remains the most high profile environmental group on the planet . greenpeace has offices in 40 countries across europe , the americas , asia and the pacific , and established its german branch in hamburg in 1980 .
greenpeace has relied mostly on donations and membership fees to maintain its global reach and its ability to the stage protests anywhere in the world . now , however , the organization has to cut back on expenses .
greenpeace 's german branch , with its annual 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 53 million -rrb- budget in donations , will have to tighten its belt - and cut about three million euros in costs per year . income decreases as expenses rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive publicity stunts are eating into funds managing director brigitte behrens has refuted claims that the current financial situation at greenpeace is a problem of mismanagement .
" no , our donations are stable , " behrens said , " but they 're not increasing at the rate our costs are . " last year alone , the german branch spent hundreds of thousands of euros more than it brought in .
as a result , costs will have to be reduced as of 2008 - and the largest cuts will be in the personnel sector .
works council representative christiane sattler said the 217 employees in hamburg fear for their jobs . " people are n't in a good mood because it 's going to be a tough cut , " sattler said .
" we do n't yet know who will lose their jobs , and what the concept for 2008 will be .

" there 's been quite a lot of restructuring on an international level over the past two years , and we at greenpeace germany want to more strongly support international campaigns , " brigitte behrens said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 10.12.2006 greenpeace germany struggles for funding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staging high profile protests is costing greenpeace germany the shirt off its back saving the planet costs money .
despite surviving for 26 years , environmental organization greenpeace 's german branch is now experiencing a lack of funding which could make fighting the good fight even harder . the renowned environmental organization greenpeace focuses on the most crucial worldwide threats to the environment .
its high profile and spectacular campaigns have ensured that greenpeace remains the most high profile environmental group on the planet . greenpeace has offices in 40 countries across europe , the americas , asia and the pacific , and established its german branch in hamburg in 1980 .
greenpeace has relied mostly on donations and membership fees to maintain its global reach and its ability to the stage protests anywhere in the world . now , however , the organization has to cut back on expenses .
greenpeace 's german branch , with its annual 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 53 million -rrb- budget in donations , will have to tighten its belt - and cut about three million euros in costs per year . income decreases as expenses rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive publicity stunts are eating into funds managing director brigitte behrens has refuted claims that the current financial situation at greenpeace is a problem of mismanagement .
" no , our donations are stable , " behrens said , " but they 're not increasing at the rate our costs are . " last year alone , the german branch spent hundreds of thousands of euros more than it brought in .
as a result , costs will have to be reduced as of 2008 - and the largest cuts will be in the personnel sector .
works council representative christiane sattler said the 217 employees in hamburg fear for their jobs . " people are n't in a good mood because it 's going to be a tough cut , " sattler said .
" we do n't yet know who will lose their jobs , and what the concept for 2008 will be .
we have n't been given details yet . " management and the works council plan to have worked out a concept by april next year . " there 's been quite a lot of restructuring on an international level over the past two years , and we at greenpeace germany want to more strongly support international campaigns , " brigitte behrens said .
" our branch , for example , is contributing to a new greenpeace ship . " the rainbow warrior ii is expected to cost 15 million euros , and the german branch , said to be the richest , plans to foot about half of that bill . job cuts go against philosophy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace staff are in danger of being cut works council representative sattler agreed that after 26 years , it was time for some changes and readjustment .
" of course we 're proud to be part of an international organization , " she said . " the organization 's international work is especially important ; it 's just that being told to slash jobs is a bit of a contradiction for an organization that was always big on employee participation . " the organization 's values , like fairness and justice , should also apply to employees , sattler added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .

and why are the french always puzzled when they look at a skylight ?
it 's because they use words of german origin , sometimes without even realizing it . many students of the german language - especially those who suffered their way through cruel , teutonic grammar drills , lost their sense of orientation trying to order their german words correctly , or wounded both their tongues and sense of self-esteem with sharp , unpronounceable compound words - get rather surprised when they come to germany and hear the language of goethe in actual use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german grammar is not for the faint of heart people in germany are often invited to attend " ein meeting , " asked to bring along their " down-geloadete " information and told " sorry " -lrb- with a rolling " r " -rrb- when somebody bumps into them on the street . but - even in the age of digital communication , dominated by the english language and us american pop culture - it is not only english words that cross national and linguistic borders . the german language council recently organized an international contest called " word migrations . "
people from 70 countries - ranging from mexico to singapore , malaysia and south korea to nigeria - participated in the linguistic hunt for german words that " migrated " to other languages .
over 6,000 such words were submitted .
a winner was drawn from the entries and the award ceremony took place thursday in munich . coffee break par excellence " the response to our first advertisement was enormous , " said rudolf hoberg of the association for the german language , one of the organizations participating in the german language council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german buses rarely need to go for a coffee break the winning entry also showed that germany is not only a language of profound philosophy and utmost , technical efficiency , but also a language of leisure and procrastination . susanne bätjer from germany was wondering why a finnish public-transit bus , which she saw in 2005 , had the word " kaffepaussi " displayed on its automated destination display .
do finnish buses really take coffee breaks ?
bätjer learned in the end that the german word for coffee break had acquired an additional , slightly different , meaning in finnish : " out of order . " some german words - such as kindergarten , zeitgeist , and sauerkraut - have long been known as german imports into the english language .
but the goal of the project was to go beyond the obvious examples and explore the extent to which german words have infiltrated other languages . " we wanted to find out what german words are used on an everyday basis in other countries , " hoberg said . a colorful collection the results of this survey - which one could best place in the category of linguistic anthropology - told a fascinating story of german technical expertise , colonial history , cultural stereotypes and a delightful sense of humor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodka is a great way to spread international understanding the turkish rail system was started in 1913 with german assistance , which is why turkish train conductors always cry " fertik " -lrb- " fertig " - ready or finished in german -rrb- when the train is about to leave the station .
in cameroon , once a german colony , train stations are called " banop " -lrb- " bahnhof " -rrb- .
if one is anesthetized in tanzania , they are - all joking aside - " nusu kaput " -lrb- half-broken -rrb- .
in afrikaans , the language of dutch settlers in south africa , an impatient german is an " aberjetzte " -lrb- " aber jetzt " in german means " on the double " or " asap " -rrb- . " the vocabulary of the german language is far better known abroad than we thought , " hoberg said . and even though contributions came from all over the word - the russians raise a glass of vodka to " brudershaft , " a gesture of friendship and brotherhood -lrb- german " brüderschaft " -rrb- , while some american presidential candidates can be best described as wishy-washy -lrb- from german " wischi-waschi , " lacking a clear-cut standpoint -rrb- - most of the words were submitted from eastern europe and anglo-saxon cultural areas . what 's that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is for many students an excercise in delayed gratification it may come as a surprise , however , that the most frequently submitted entry was the french word for skylight - " vasistas . "
in the original german , " was ist das " means , literally , " what 's that ? "
yet most french speakers probably do n't pay attention to the fact that skylights in french provoke , etymologically speaking , a sense of puzzled inquiry about the state of the world . it is also unlikely that japanese students who have an odd student job called " arubaito " realize that they are , from an etymological point of view , part of germany 's labor-intensive work culture -lrb- " arbeit " means work in german -rrb- . " the project does not attempt a linguistic investigation , " hoberg said .
" some words that were sent in might well be only passing fads . " whether as temporary guest workers in foreign languages , or as naturalized citizens , german words have long left the confines of the german-speaking world .
a large collection of colorful cross-linguistic gems - along with personal anecdotes and insights into the way cultures collide and enrich each other - has now been collected and published as a book under the title " ausgewanderte wörter " -lrb- available in german only -rrb- . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mcdeutsch – is the german language going global ?

it 's because they use words of german origin , sometimes without even realizing it . many students of the german language - especially those who suffered their way through cruel , teutonic grammar drills , lost their sense of orientation trying to order their german words correctly , or wounded both their tongues and sense of self-esteem with sharp , unpronounceable compound words - get rather surprised when they come to germany and hear the language of goethe in actual use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german grammar is not for the faint of heart people in germany are often invited to attend " ein meeting , " asked to bring along their " down-geloadete " information and told " sorry " -lrb- with a rolling " r " -rrb- when somebody bumps into them on the street . but - even in the age of digital communication , dominated by the english language and us american pop culture - it is not only english words that cross national and linguistic borders . the german language council recently organized an international contest called " word migrations .

despite surviving for 26 years , environmental organization greenpeace 's german branch is now experiencing a lack of funding which could make fighting the good fight even harder . the renowned environmental organization greenpeace focuses on the most crucial worldwide threats to the environment .
its high profile and spectacular campaigns have ensured that greenpeace remains the most high profile environmental group on the planet . greenpeace has offices in 40 countries across europe , the americas , asia and the pacific , and established its german branch in hamburg in 1980 .
greenpeace has relied mostly on donations and membership fees to maintain its global reach and its ability to the stage protests anywhere in the world . now , however , the organization has to cut back on expenses .
greenpeace 's german branch , with its annual 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 53 million -rrb- budget in donations , will have to tighten its belt - and cut about three million euros in costs per year . income decreases as expenses rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive publicity stunts are eating into funds managing director brigitte behrens has refuted claims that the current financial situation at greenpeace is a problem of mismanagement .
" no , our donations are stable , " behrens said , " but they 're not increasing at the rate our costs are . " last year alone , the german branch spent hundreds of thousands of euros more than it brought in .
as a result , costs will have to be reduced as of 2008 - and the largest cuts will be in the personnel sector .
works council representative christiane sattler said the 217 employees in hamburg fear for their jobs . " people are n't in a good mood because it 's going to be a tough cut , " sattler said .
" we do n't yet know who will lose their jobs , and what the concept for 2008 will be .
we have n't been given details yet . " management and the works council plan to have worked out a concept by april next year . " there 's been quite a lot of restructuring on an international level over the past two years , and we at greenpeace germany want to more strongly support international campaigns , " brigitte behrens said .
" our branch , for example , is contributing to a new greenpeace ship . " the rainbow warrior ii is expected to cost 15 million euros , and the german branch , said to be the richest , plans to foot about half of that bill . job cuts go against philosophy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace staff are in danger of being cut works council representative sattler agreed that after 26 years , it was time for some changes and readjustment .

despite surviving for 26 years , environmental organization greenpeace 's german branch is now experiencing a lack of funding which could make fighting the good fight even harder . the renowned environmental organization greenpeace focuses on the most crucial worldwide threats to the environment .
its high profile and spectacular campaigns have ensured that greenpeace remains the most high profile environmental group on the planet . greenpeace has offices in 40 countries across europe , the americas , asia and the pacific , and established its german branch in hamburg in 1980 .
greenpeace has relied mostly on donations and membership fees to maintain its global reach and its ability to the stage protests anywhere in the world . now , however , the organization has to cut back on expenses .
greenpeace 's german branch , with its annual 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 53 million -rrb- budget in donations , will have to tighten its belt - and cut about three million euros in costs per year . income decreases as expenses rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive publicity stunts are eating into funds managing director brigitte behrens has refuted claims that the current financial situation at greenpeace is a problem of mismanagement .
" no , our donations are stable , " behrens said , " but they 're not increasing at the rate our costs are . " last year alone , the german branch spent hundreds of thousands of euros more than it brought in .
as a result , costs will have to be reduced as of 2008 - and the largest cuts will be in the personnel sector .
works council representative christiane sattler said the 217 employees in hamburg fear for their jobs . " people are n't in a good mood because it 's going to be a tough cut , " sattler said .
" we do n't yet know who will lose their jobs , and what the concept for 2008 will be .
we have n't been given details yet . " management and the works council plan to have worked out a concept by april next year . " there 's been quite a lot of restructuring on an international level over the past two years , and we at greenpeace germany want to more strongly support international campaigns , " brigitte behrens said .
" our branch , for example , is contributing to a new greenpeace ship . " the rainbow warrior ii is expected to cost 15 million euros , and the german branch , said to be the richest , plans to foot about half of that bill . job cuts go against philosophy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace staff are in danger of being cut works council representative sattler agreed that after 26 years , it was time for some changes and readjustment .
" of course we 're proud to be part of an international organization , " she said . " the organization 's international work is especially important ; it 's just that being told to slash jobs is a bit of a contradiction for an organization that was always big on employee participation .

and why are the french always puzzled when they look at a skylight ?
it 's because they use words of german origin , sometimes without even realizing it . many students of the german language - especially those who suffered their way through cruel , teutonic grammar drills , lost their sense of orientation trying to order their german words correctly , or wounded both their tongues and sense of self-esteem with sharp , unpronounceable compound words - get rather surprised when they come to germany and hear the language of goethe in actual use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german grammar is not for the faint of heart people in germany are often invited to attend " ein meeting , " asked to bring along their " down-geloadete " information and told " sorry " -lrb- with a rolling " r " -rrb- when somebody bumps into them on the street . but - even in the age of digital communication , dominated by the english language and us american pop culture - it is not only english words that cross national and linguistic borders . the german language council recently organized an international contest called " word migrations . "
people from 70 countries - ranging from mexico to singapore , malaysia and south korea to nigeria - participated in the linguistic hunt for german words that " migrated " to other languages .
over 6,000 such words were submitted .
a winner was drawn from the entries and the award ceremony took place thursday in munich . coffee break par excellence " the response to our first advertisement was enormous , " said rudolf hoberg of the association for the german language , one of the organizations participating in the german language council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german buses rarely need to go for a coffee break the winning entry also showed that germany is not only a language of profound philosophy and utmost , technical efficiency , but also a language of leisure and procrastination . susanne bätjer from germany was wondering why a finnish public-transit bus , which she saw in 2005 , had the word " kaffepaussi " displayed on its automated destination display .
do finnish buses really take coffee breaks ?
bätjer learned in the end that the german word for coffee break had acquired an additional , slightly different , meaning in finnish : " out of order . " some german words - such as kindergarten , zeitgeist , and sauerkraut - have long been known as german imports into the english language .
but the goal of the project was to go beyond the obvious examples and explore the extent to which german words have infiltrated other languages . " we wanted to find out what german words are used on an everyday basis in other countries , " hoberg said . a colorful collection the results of this survey - which one could best place in the category of linguistic anthropology - told a fascinating story of german technical expertise , colonial history , cultural stereotypes and a delightful sense of humor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodka is a great way to spread international understanding the turkish rail system was started in 1913 with german assistance , which is why turkish train conductors always cry " fertik " -lrb- " fertig " - ready or finished in german -rrb- when the train is about to leave the station .
in cameroon , once a german colony , train stations are called " banop " -lrb- " bahnhof " -rrb- .
if one is anesthetized in tanzania , they are - all joking aside - " nusu kaput " -lrb- half-broken -rrb- .
in afrikaans , the language of dutch settlers in south africa , an impatient german is an " aberjetzte " -lrb- " aber jetzt " in german means " on the double " or " asap " -rrb- . " the vocabulary of the german language is far better known abroad than we thought , " hoberg said . and even though contributions came from all over the word - the russians raise a glass of vodka to " brudershaft , " a gesture of friendship and brotherhood -lrb- german " brüderschaft " -rrb- , while some american presidential candidates can be best described as wishy-washy -lrb- from german " wischi-waschi , " lacking a clear-cut standpoint -rrb- - most of the words were submitted from eastern europe and anglo-saxon cultural areas . what 's that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is for many students an excercise in delayed gratification it may come as a surprise , however , that the most frequently submitted entry was the french word for skylight - " vasistas . "
in the original german , " was ist das " means , literally , " what 's that ? "
yet most french speakers probably do n't pay attention to the fact that skylights in french provoke , etymologically speaking , a sense of puzzled inquiry about the state of the world . it is also unlikely that japanese students who have an odd student job called " arubaito " realize that they are , from an etymological point of view , part of germany 's labor-intensive work culture -lrb- " arbeit " means work in german -rrb- . " the project does not attempt a linguistic investigation , " hoberg said .
" some words that were sent in might well be only passing fads . " whether as temporary guest workers in foreign languages , or as naturalized citizens , german words have long left the confines of the german-speaking world .

a first wave of three or four countries was expected to be ready by january 2007 . but the forecasters failed to take into account that there would be governments that were able but unwilling to adopt the euro , others that were willing but unable , and some that were neither willing nor able .
in the end , the club will gain just one new member on jan .
1 , when slovenia 's two million inhabitants give up their tolars .
fast-growing baltics disappointed cyprus ' population of 750,000 and the 400,000 maltese are expected to swap their pounds and liras the following year .
slovakia , with a population of 5.4 million , is also on course to switch from the koruna in january 2009 , despite the formation earlier this year of a coalition government including euro-skeptic populists and the far right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : come january , one more country will join the euro but things are looking more complicated for the six other countries that joined the eu two years ago , taking the bloc 's membership to 25 . the baltic nations of lithuania and estonia had hoped to join the euro zone in 2007 .
in theory , nothing could have been easier .
the lithuanian lita and the estonian kroon are tied to the euro and the health of their public finances , a key measure for euro-zone membership , causes envy in countries like france or germany .
but both are experiencing spectacular growth - in estonia the rate was 12 percent in the third quarter alone - and consumer prices are rising slightly faster than in the rest of the eu . the maastricht treaty , which laid the foundations of the euro zone , sets inflation caps for members , and the baltic states have been just shy of the target .
lithuania was annoyed that it did not get a green light earlier this year .
in march , its average inflation rate was just 0.06 percent above the limit . the stern stance of the 12 euro-zone members towards potential members was a surprise for economists , who say the inflation criteria are irrelevant for countries that are catching up with western europe and have already pegged their currencies to the euro . in order to achieve the living standards of the eu 's western members , the former communist countries have little choice but to let salaries and prices increase , which inevitably fuels inflation .
indulgence was then the current intransigence contrasts with the indulgence toward euro-zone founders such as belgium and italy .
both were allowed to adopt the single currency even though their public debt represented more than 100 percent of their gross domestic product .
under euro-zone rules , the maximum is supposed to be 60 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank chief jean-claude trichet while they are solid supporters of the euro , the baltic states have bitterly resigned themselves to having to wait - but are making their discontent known .

and why are the french always puzzled when they look at a skylight ?
it 's because they use words of german origin , sometimes without even realizing it . many students of the german language - especially those who suffered their way through cruel , teutonic grammar drills , lost their sense of orientation trying to order their german words correctly , or wounded both their tongues and sense of self-esteem with sharp , unpronounceable compound words - get rather surprised when they come to germany and hear the language of goethe in actual use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german grammar is not for the faint of heart people in germany are often invited to attend " ein meeting , " asked to bring along their " down-geloadete " information and told " sorry " -lrb- with a rolling " r " -rrb- when somebody bumps into them on the street . but - even in the age of digital communication , dominated by the english language and us american pop culture - it is not only english words that cross national and linguistic borders . the german language council recently organized an international contest called " word migrations . "
people from 70 countries - ranging from mexico to singapore , malaysia and south korea to nigeria - participated in the linguistic hunt for german words that " migrated " to other languages .
over 6,000 such words were submitted .
a winner was drawn from the entries and the award ceremony took place thursday in munich . coffee break par excellence " the response to our first advertisement was enormous , " said rudolf hoberg of the association for the german language , one of the organizations participating in the german language council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german buses rarely need to go for a coffee break the winning entry also showed that germany is not only a language of profound philosophy and utmost , technical efficiency , but also a language of leisure and procrastination . susanne bätjer from germany was wondering why a finnish public-transit bus , which she saw in 2005 , had the word " kaffepaussi " displayed on its automated destination display .
do finnish buses really take coffee breaks ?
bätjer learned in the end that the german word for coffee break had acquired an additional , slightly different , meaning in finnish : " out of order . " some german words - such as kindergarten , zeitgeist , and sauerkraut - have long been known as german imports into the english language .
but the goal of the project was to go beyond the obvious examples and explore the extent to which german words have infiltrated other languages . " we wanted to find out what german words are used on an everyday basis in other countries , " hoberg said . a colorful collection the results of this survey - which one could best place in the category of linguistic anthropology - told a fascinating story of german technical expertise , colonial history , cultural stereotypes and a delightful sense of humor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodka is a great way to spread international understanding the turkish rail system was started in 1913 with german assistance , which is why turkish train conductors always cry " fertik " -lrb- " fertig " - ready or finished in german -rrb- when the train is about to leave the station .
in cameroon , once a german colony , train stations are called " banop " -lrb- " bahnhof " -rrb- .
if one is anesthetized in tanzania , they are - all joking aside - " nusu kaput " -lrb- half-broken -rrb- .
in afrikaans , the language of dutch settlers in south africa , an impatient german is an " aberjetzte " -lrb- " aber jetzt " in german means " on the double " or " asap " -rrb- . " the vocabulary of the german language is far better known abroad than we thought , " hoberg said . and even though contributions came from all over the word - the russians raise a glass of vodka to " brudershaft , " a gesture of friendship and brotherhood -lrb- german " brüderschaft " -rrb- , while some american presidential candidates can be best described as wishy-washy -lrb- from german " wischi-waschi , " lacking a clear-cut standpoint -rrb- - most of the words were submitted from eastern europe and anglo-saxon cultural areas . what 's that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is for many students an excercise in delayed gratification it may come as a surprise , however , that the most frequently submitted entry was the french word for skylight - " vasistas . "
in the original german , " was ist das " means , literally , " what 's that ? "
yet most french speakers probably do n't pay attention to the fact that skylights in french provoke , etymologically speaking , a sense of puzzled inquiry about the state of the world . it is also unlikely that japanese students who have an odd student job called " arubaito " realize that they are , from an etymological point of view , part of germany 's labor-intensive work culture -lrb- " arbeit " means work in german -rrb- . " the project does not attempt a linguistic investigation , " hoberg said .
" some words that were sent in might well be only passing fads . " whether as temporary guest workers in foreign languages , or as naturalized citizens , german words have long left the confines of the german-speaking world .
a large collection of colorful cross-linguistic gems - along with personal anecdotes and insights into the way cultures collide and enrich each other - has now been collected and published as a book under the title " ausgewanderte wörter " -lrb- available in german only -rrb- . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mcdeutsch – is the german language going global ?

a first wave of three or four countries was expected to be ready by january 2007 . but the forecasters failed to take into account that there would be governments that were able but unwilling to adopt the euro , others that were willing but unable , and some that were neither willing nor able .
in the end , the club will gain just one new member on jan .
1 , when slovenia 's two million inhabitants give up their tolars .
fast-growing baltics disappointed cyprus ' population of 750,000 and the 400,000 maltese are expected to swap their pounds and liras the following year .
slovakia , with a population of 5.4 million , is also on course to switch from the koruna in january 2009 , despite the formation earlier this year of a coalition government including euro-skeptic populists and the far right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : come january , one more country will join the euro but things are looking more complicated for the six other countries that joined the eu two years ago , taking the bloc 's membership to 25 . the baltic nations of lithuania and estonia had hoped to join the euro zone in 2007 .
in theory , nothing could have been easier .
the lithuanian lita and the estonian kroon are tied to the euro and the health of their public finances , a key measure for euro-zone membership , causes envy in countries like france or germany .
but both are experiencing spectacular growth - in estonia the rate was 12 percent in the third quarter alone - and consumer prices are rising slightly faster than in the rest of the eu . the maastricht treaty , which laid the foundations of the euro zone , sets inflation caps for members , and the baltic states have been just shy of the target .
lithuania was annoyed that it did not get a green light earlier this year .
in march , its average inflation rate was just 0.06 percent above the limit . the stern stance of the 12 euro-zone members towards potential members was a surprise for economists , who say the inflation criteria are irrelevant for countries that are catching up with western europe and have already pegged their currencies to the euro . in order to achieve the living standards of the eu 's western members , the former communist countries have little choice but to let salaries and prices increase , which inevitably fuels inflation .
indulgence was then the current intransigence contrasts with the indulgence toward euro-zone founders such as belgium and italy .
both were allowed to adopt the single currency even though their public debt represented more than 100 percent of their gross domestic product .
under euro-zone rules , the maximum is supposed to be 60 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank chief jean-claude trichet while they are solid supporters of the euro , the baltic states have bitterly resigned themselves to having to wait - but are making their discontent known . " it would not be very good if the otherwise good performing countries are left out of the euro area for an extended period , just because of the inflation criterion , " estonian finance minister aivar soerd told afp . apart from slovakia , other new eu members in central europe have put the euro on the back burner .
poland , where euro-skeptic conservatives have been in power for a year , has declined to fix a timetable , simply saying that it aims to hold a referendum in 2010 on whether to give up the zloty - even though joining the single currency was one of the planks of the eu membership treaty already approved by polish voters in 2003 .
warsaw points to the example of sweden , which joined the eu in 1995 and decided to keep the krona after a referendum in 2003 . hungary , which faces a plunging public deficit , has pushed its euro-zone target back to 2013 , while the czech republic is planning to join in 2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu accepts slovenia , rejects lithuania as euro zone member the european commission gave slovenia a green light tuesday to join europe 's single currency next year , but held off on offering approval to lithuania .

and why are the french always puzzled when they look at a skylight ?
it 's because they use words of german origin , sometimes without even realizing it . many students of the german language - especially those who suffered their way through cruel , teutonic grammar drills , lost their sense of orientation trying to order their german words correctly , or wounded both their tongues and sense of self-esteem with sharp , unpronounceable compound words - get rather surprised when they come to germany and hear the language of goethe in actual use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german grammar is not for the faint of heart people in germany are often invited to attend " ein meeting , " asked to bring along their " down-geloadete " information and told " sorry " -lrb- with a rolling " r " -rrb- when somebody bumps into them on the street . but - even in the age of digital communication , dominated by the english language and us american pop culture - it is not only english words that cross national and linguistic borders . the german language council recently organized an international contest called " word migrations . "
people from 70 countries - ranging from mexico to singapore , malaysia and south korea to nigeria - participated in the linguistic hunt for german words that " migrated " to other languages .
over 6,000 such words were submitted .
a winner was drawn from the entries and the award ceremony took place thursday in munich . coffee break par excellence " the response to our first advertisement was enormous , " said rudolf hoberg of the association for the german language , one of the organizations participating in the german language council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german buses rarely need to go for a coffee break the winning entry also showed that germany is not only a language of profound philosophy and utmost , technical efficiency , but also a language of leisure and procrastination . susanne bätjer from germany was wondering why a finnish public-transit bus , which she saw in 2005 , had the word " kaffepaussi " displayed on its automated destination display .
do finnish buses really take coffee breaks ?
bätjer learned in the end that the german word for coffee break had acquired an additional , slightly different , meaning in finnish : " out of order . " some german words - such as kindergarten , zeitgeist , and sauerkraut - have long been known as german imports into the english language .
but the goal of the project was to go beyond the obvious examples and explore the extent to which german words have infiltrated other languages . " we wanted to find out what german words are used on an everyday basis in other countries , " hoberg said . a colorful collection the results of this survey - which one could best place in the category of linguistic anthropology - told a fascinating story of german technical expertise , colonial history , cultural stereotypes and a delightful sense of humor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodka is a great way to spread international understanding the turkish rail system was started in 1913 with german assistance , which is why turkish train conductors always cry " fertik " -lrb- " fertig " - ready or finished in german -rrb- when the train is about to leave the station .
in cameroon , once a german colony , train stations are called " banop " -lrb- " bahnhof " -rrb- .
if one is anesthetized in tanzania , they are - all joking aside - " nusu kaput " -lrb- half-broken -rrb- .
in afrikaans , the language of dutch settlers in south africa , an impatient german is an " aberjetzte " -lrb- " aber jetzt " in german means " on the double " or " asap " -rrb- . " the vocabulary of the german language is far better known abroad than we thought , " hoberg said . and even though contributions came from all over the word - the russians raise a glass of vodka to " brudershaft , " a gesture of friendship and brotherhood -lrb- german " brüderschaft " -rrb- , while some american presidential candidates can be best described as wishy-washy -lrb- from german " wischi-waschi , " lacking a clear-cut standpoint -rrb- - most of the words were submitted from eastern europe and anglo-saxon cultural areas . what 's that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is for many students an excercise in delayed gratification it may come as a surprise , however , that the most frequently submitted entry was the french word for skylight - " vasistas . "
in the original german , " was ist das " means , literally , " what 's that ? "
yet most french speakers probably do n't pay attention to the fact that skylights in french provoke , etymologically speaking , a sense of puzzled inquiry about the state of the world . it is also unlikely that japanese students who have an odd student job called " arubaito " realize that they are , from an etymological point of view , part of germany 's labor-intensive work culture -lrb- " arbeit " means work in german -rrb- . " the project does not attempt a linguistic investigation , " hoberg said .
" some words that were sent in might well be only passing fads . " whether as temporary guest workers in foreign languages , or as naturalized citizens , german words have long left the confines of the german-speaking world .
a large collection of colorful cross-linguistic gems - along with personal anecdotes and insights into the way cultures collide and enrich each other - has now been collected and published as a book under the title " ausgewanderte wörter " -lrb- available in german only -rrb- . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mcdeutsch – is the german language going global ?
didn ’ t the german language make its international mark a long time ago with goethe , kant and co . ?
is there any room for modernity - or global thinking ?
those behind the " mcdeutsch " project want to find out .

" we found radiation in the car in which he drove after he arrived in hamburg from russia on october 28 and in a document he signed at the immigration offices , " menzel told reporters . investigators have also found traces of polonium 210 on the couch in kovtun 's ex-wife 's flat where he slept on the night of oct .
30 , menzel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kovtun is reportedly suffering from radiation sickness " tests have shown clearly that we are dealing with polonium 210 , " gerald kirchner from the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- told reporters , referring to the places visited by the businessman during his three-day stay in germany . kovtun is one of three russians who met with kremlin critic litvinenko in london on november 1 , the day on which the former russian spy fell ill .
kovtun has also been hospitalized with severe radioactive poisoning . " he appeared to have been in active contact with polonium .
we are considering him as a suspect also , " hamburg state prosecutor martin koehnke said .
" we have to establish whether he was poisoned himself or carried the polonium into the country , " koehnke said . he said german investigators would share all evidence they uncover with british counterparts probing the murder which friends and family of the victim have blamed squarely on the russian government . litvinenko 's widow blames " hit squad " in her first public interviews since his death on nov .
23 , litvinenko 's widow marina on sunday stood by his death-bed accusation that he was killed by a russian " hit squad " because of his openly critical views of the kremlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german authorities have been investigating in the case of kovtun since friday " obviously , it was not -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin himself , of course not , " the 44-year-old told the mail on sunday .
" but what putin does around him in russia makes it possible to kill a british person on british soil .
i believe that it could have been the russian authorities . " marina litvinenko told the british press her husband immediately suspected he had been poisoned when he first fell ill on nov .
1 . the former lieutenant-colonel in the federal security services -lrb- fsb -rrb- who fell out with moscow over the conflict in chechnya died three weeks later after large quantities of polonium 210 were found in his body . litvinenko and his father valter 's accusations against putin were supported sunday by the former agent 's friend , vladimir bukovsky , who told the bbc he was convinced of " clear " russian involvement .
moscow has launched its own probe , but associates of litvinenko said they would only cooperate with russian investigators if their safety were guaranteed . a british channel 4 television report this week quoted a senior british police source as saying that they believed litvinenko was poisoned at the central london hotel where he met three russian contacts on nov .
1 . the probe widened to germany after hamburg police found that kovtun was registered with the city 's immigration authorities and found that he still owned a home there . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ministers meet over poisoning of ex-russian spy the death of a former russian spy by radioactive poison has strained eu relations with moscow , especially considering allegations that the kremlin was involved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 10.12.2006 when german words travel , our zeitgeist goes oom-pah-pah großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no reason for schadenfreude : german is an international language why do finnish buses take coffee breaks ?
and why are the french always puzzled when they look at a skylight ?
it 's because they use words of german origin , sometimes without even realizing it . many students of the german language - especially those who suffered their way through cruel , teutonic grammar drills , lost their sense of orientation trying to order their german words correctly , or wounded both their tongues and sense of self-esteem with sharp , unpronounceable compound words - get rather surprised when they come to germany and hear the language of goethe in actual use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german grammar is not for the faint of heart people in germany are often invited to attend " ein meeting , " asked to bring along their " down-geloadete " information and told " sorry " -lrb- with a rolling " r " -rrb- when somebody bumps into them on the street . but - even in the age of digital communication , dominated by the english language and us american pop culture - it is not only english words that cross national and linguistic borders . the german language council recently organized an international contest called " word migrations . "
people from 70 countries - ranging from mexico to singapore , malaysia and south korea to nigeria - participated in the linguistic hunt for german words that " migrated " to other languages .
over 6,000 such words were submitted .
a winner was drawn from the entries and the award ceremony took place thursday in munich . coffee break par excellence " the response to our first advertisement was enormous , " said rudolf hoberg of the association for the german language , one of the organizations participating in the german language council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german buses rarely need to go for a coffee break the winning entry also showed that germany is not only a language of profound philosophy and utmost , technical efficiency , but also a language of leisure and procrastination . susanne bätjer from germany was wondering why a finnish public-transit bus , which she saw in 2005 , had the word " kaffepaussi " displayed on its automated destination display .
do finnish buses really take coffee breaks ?
bätjer learned in the end that the german word for coffee break had acquired an additional , slightly different , meaning in finnish : " out of order . " some german words - such as kindergarten , zeitgeist , and sauerkraut - have long been known as german imports into the english language .
but the goal of the project was to go beyond the obvious examples and explore the extent to which german words have infiltrated other languages . " we wanted to find out what german words are used on an everyday basis in other countries , " hoberg said . a colorful collection the results of this survey - which one could best place in the category of linguistic anthropology - told a fascinating story of german technical expertise , colonial history , cultural stereotypes and a delightful sense of humor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodka is a great way to spread international understanding the turkish rail system was started in 1913 with german assistance , which is why turkish train conductors always cry " fertik " -lrb- " fertig " - ready or finished in german -rrb- when the train is about to leave the station .
in cameroon , once a german colony , train stations are called " banop " -lrb- " bahnhof " -rrb- .
if one is anesthetized in tanzania , they are - all joking aside - " nusu kaput " -lrb- half-broken -rrb- .
in afrikaans , the language of dutch settlers in south africa , an impatient german is an " aberjetzte " -lrb- " aber jetzt " in german means " on the double " or " asap " -rrb- . " the vocabulary of the german language is far better known abroad than we thought , " hoberg said . and even though contributions came from all over the word - the russians raise a glass of vodka to " brudershaft , " a gesture of friendship and brotherhood -lrb- german " brüderschaft " -rrb- , while some american presidential candidates can be best described as wishy-washy -lrb- from german " wischi-waschi , " lacking a clear-cut standpoint -rrb- - most of the words were submitted from eastern europe and anglo-saxon cultural areas . what 's that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is for many students an excercise in delayed gratification it may come as a surprise , however , that the most frequently submitted entry was the french word for skylight - " vasistas . "
in the original german , " was ist das " means , literally , " what 's that ? "
yet most french speakers probably do n't pay attention to the fact that skylights in french provoke , etymologically speaking , a sense of puzzled inquiry about the state of the world . it is also unlikely that japanese students who have an odd student job called " arubaito " realize that they are , from an etymological point of view , part of germany 's labor-intensive work culture -lrb- " arbeit " means work in german -rrb- . " the project does not attempt a linguistic investigation , " hoberg said .
" some words that were sent in might well be only passing fads . " whether as temporary guest workers in foreign languages , or as naturalized citizens , german words have long left the confines of the german-speaking world .
a large collection of colorful cross-linguistic gems - along with personal anecdotes and insights into the way cultures collide and enrich each other - has now been collected and published as a book under the title " ausgewanderte wörter " -lrb- available in german only -rrb- . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mcdeutsch – is the german language going global ?
didn ’ t the german language make its international mark a long time ago with goethe , kant and co . ?
is there any room for modernity - or global thinking ?
those behind the " mcdeutsch " project want to find out .
-lrb- 04.12.2006 -rrb- wanderlust sends german words traveling what do autobahn , fest , flugelhorn , angst and gesundheit all have in common ?
you guessed it : they all come from the language of goethe , thomas mann and rammstein .
you know more german words than you think you do .
-lrb- 08.08.2006 -rrb- german conservatives want linguistic law to protect language germany 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- wants the german language to be protected in the country 's constitution by a " linguistic law " which will keep the spread of english words at bay .

a first wave of three or four countries was expected to be ready by january 2007 . but the forecasters failed to take into account that there would be governments that were able but unwilling to adopt the euro , others that were willing but unable , and some that were neither willing nor able .
in the end , the club will gain just one new member on jan .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : come january , one more country will join the euro but things are looking more complicated for the six other countries that joined the eu two years ago , taking the bloc 's membership to 25 . the baltic nations of lithuania and estonia had hoped to join the euro zone in 2007 .
in theory , nothing could have been easier .
the lithuanian lita and the estonian kroon are tied to the euro and the health of their public finances , a key measure for euro-zone membership , causes envy in countries like france or germany .
but both are experiencing spectacular growth - in estonia the rate was 12 percent in the third quarter alone - and consumer prices are rising slightly faster than in the rest of the eu . the maastricht treaty , which laid the foundations of the euro zone , sets inflation caps for members , and the baltic states have been just shy of the target .
lithuania was annoyed that it did not get a green light earlier this year .
in march , its average inflation rate was just 0.06 percent above the limit . the stern stance of the 12 euro-zone members towards potential members was a surprise for economists , who say the inflation criteria are irrelevant for countries that are catching up with western europe and have already pegged their currencies to the euro . in order to achieve the living standards of the eu 's western members , the former communist countries have little choice but to let salaries and prices increase , which inevitably fuels inflation .
indulgence was then the current intransigence contrasts with the indulgence toward euro-zone founders such as belgium and italy .
both were allowed to adopt the single currency even though their public debt represented more than 100 percent of their gross domestic product .
under euro-zone rules , the maximum is supposed to be 60 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank chief jean-claude trichet while they are solid supporters of the euro , the baltic states have bitterly resigned themselves to having to wait - but are making their discontent known . " it would not be very good if the otherwise good performing countries are left out of the euro area for an extended period , just because of the inflation criterion , " estonian finance minister aivar soerd told afp . apart from slovakia , other new eu members in central europe have put the euro on the back burner .
poland , where euro-skeptic conservatives have been in power for a year , has declined to fix a timetable , simply saying that it aims to hold a referendum in 2010 on whether to give up the zloty - even though joining the single currency was one of the planks of the eu membership treaty already approved by polish voters in 2003 .
warsaw points to the example of sweden , which joined the eu in 1995 and decided to keep the krona after a referendum in 2003 . hungary , which faces a plunging public deficit , has pushed its euro-zone target back to 2013 , while the czech republic is planning to join in 2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu accepts slovenia , rejects lithuania as euro zone member the european commission gave slovenia a green light tuesday to join europe 's single currency next year , but held off on offering approval to lithuania .
-lrb- 16.05.2006 -rrb- germany keeps its midas touch - for now a widening budget deficit continues to haunt berlin .
spending cuts and tax increases are supposed to shrink the horrific shortfalls .
some would like to sell the country ’ s treasured gold reserves to help make ends meet .

upon the expansion of the bloc , the new states in the east have committed themselves to joining the currency union but the path is filled with numerous obstacles .

for some , the university is actually the first opportunity to meet other people with disabilities . according to a survey by the german student union , some 15 percent of german students have a disability or are chronically ill .
in addition to attending lectures , making photocopies and taking coffee breaks , students with disabilities also need to deal with a lot of administrative paperwork .

a first wave of three or four countries was expected to be ready by january 2007 . but the forecasters failed to take into account that there would be governments that were able but unwilling to adopt the euro , others that were willing but unable , and some that were neither willing nor able .
in the end , the club will gain just one new member on jan .
1 , when slovenia 's two million inhabitants give up their tolars .
fast-growing baltics disappointed cyprus ' population of 750,000 and the 400,000 maltese are expected to swap their pounds and liras the following year .
slovakia , with a population of 5.4 million , is also on course to switch from the koruna in january 2009 , despite the formation earlier this year of a coalition government including euro-skeptic populists and the far right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : come january , one more country will join the euro but things are looking more complicated for the six other countries that joined the eu two years ago , taking the bloc 's membership to 25 . the baltic nations of lithuania and estonia had hoped to join the euro zone in 2007 .
in theory , nothing could have been easier .
the lithuanian lita and the estonian kroon are tied to the euro and the health of their public finances , a key measure for euro-zone membership , causes envy in countries like france or germany .
but both are experiencing spectacular growth - in estonia the rate was 12 percent in the third quarter alone - and consumer prices are rising slightly faster than in the rest of the eu . the maastricht treaty , which laid the foundations of the euro zone , sets inflation caps for members , and the baltic states have been just shy of the target .
lithuania was annoyed that it did not get a green light earlier this year .
in march , its average inflation rate was just 0.06 percent above the limit . the stern stance of the 12 euro-zone members towards potential members was a surprise for economists , who say the inflation criteria are irrelevant for countries that are catching up with western europe and have already pegged their currencies to the euro . in order to achieve the living standards of the eu 's western members , the former communist countries have little choice but to let salaries and prices increase , which inevitably fuels inflation .
indulgence was then the current intransigence contrasts with the indulgence toward euro-zone founders such as belgium and italy .
both were allowed to adopt the single currency even though their public debt represented more than 100 percent of their gross domestic product .
under euro-zone rules , the maximum is supposed to be 60 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank chief jean-claude trichet while they are solid supporters of the euro , the baltic states have bitterly resigned themselves to having to wait - but are making their discontent known . " it would not be very good if the otherwise good performing countries are left out of the euro area for an extended period , just because of the inflation criterion , " estonian finance minister aivar soerd told afp . apart from slovakia , other new eu members in central europe have put the euro on the back burner .
poland , where euro-skeptic conservatives have been in power for a year , has declined to fix a timetable , simply saying that it aims to hold a referendum in 2010 on whether to give up the zloty - even though joining the single currency was one of the planks of the eu membership treaty already approved by polish voters in 2003 .
warsaw points to the example of sweden , which joined the eu in 1995 and decided to keep the krona after a referendum in 2003 . hungary , which faces a plunging public deficit , has pushed its euro-zone target back to 2013 , while the czech republic is planning to join in 2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu accepts slovenia , rejects lithuania as euro zone member the european commission gave slovenia a green light tuesday to join europe 's single currency next year , but held off on offering approval to lithuania .

despite surviving for 26 years , environmental organization greenpeace 's german branch is now experiencing a lack of funding which could make fighting the good fight even harder . the renowned environmental organization greenpeace focuses on the most crucial worldwide threats to the environment .
its high profile and spectacular campaigns have ensured that greenpeace remains the most high profile environmental group on the planet . greenpeace has offices in 40 countries across europe , the americas , asia and the pacific , and established its german branch in hamburg in 1980 .
greenpeace has relied mostly on donations and membership fees to maintain its global reach and its ability to the stage protests anywhere in the world . now , however , the organization has to cut back on expenses .
greenpeace 's german branch , with its annual 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 53 million -rrb- budget in donations , will have to tighten its belt - and cut about three million euros in costs per year . income decreases as expenses rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive publicity stunts are eating into funds managing director brigitte behrens has refuted claims that the current financial situation at greenpeace is a problem of mismanagement .
" no , our donations are stable , " behrens said , " but they 're not increasing at the rate our costs are . " last year alone , the german branch spent hundreds of thousands of euros more than it brought in .
as a result , costs will have to be reduced as of 2008 - and the largest cuts will be in the personnel sector .
works council representative christiane sattler said the 217 employees in hamburg fear for their jobs . " people are n't in a good mood because it 's going to be a tough cut , " sattler said .
" we do n't yet know who will lose their jobs , and what the concept for 2008 will be .
we have n't been given details yet . " management and the works council plan to have worked out a concept by april next year . " there 's been quite a lot of restructuring on an international level over the past two years , and we at greenpeace germany want to more strongly support international campaigns , " brigitte behrens said .
" our branch , for example , is contributing to a new greenpeace ship . " the rainbow warrior ii is expected to cost 15 million euros , and the german branch , said to be the richest , plans to foot about half of that bill . job cuts go against philosophy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace staff are in danger of being cut works council representative sattler agreed that after 26 years , it was time for some changes and readjustment .
" of course we 're proud to be part of an international organization , " she said . " the organization 's international work is especially important ; it 's just that being told to slash jobs is a bit of a contradiction for an organization that was always big on employee participation . " the organization 's values , like fairness and justice , should also apply to employees , sattler added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .

" we found radiation in the car in which he drove after he arrived in hamburg from russia on october 28 and in a document he signed at the immigration offices , " menzel told reporters . investigators have also found traces of polonium 210 on the couch in kovtun 's ex-wife 's flat where he slept on the night of oct .
30 , menzel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kovtun is reportedly suffering from radiation sickness " tests have shown clearly that we are dealing with polonium 210 , " gerald kirchner from the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- told reporters , referring to the places visited by the businessman during his three-day stay in germany . kovtun is one of three russians who met with kremlin critic litvinenko in london on november 1 , the day on which the former russian spy fell ill .
kovtun has also been hospitalized with severe radioactive poisoning . " he appeared to have been in active contact with polonium .
we are considering him as a suspect also , " hamburg state prosecutor martin koehnke said .
" we have to establish whether he was poisoned himself or carried the polonium into the country , " koehnke said . he said german investigators would share all evidence they uncover with british counterparts probing the murder which friends and family of the victim have blamed squarely on the russian government . litvinenko 's widow blames " hit squad " in her first public interviews since his death on nov .
23 , litvinenko 's widow marina on sunday stood by his death-bed accusation that he was killed by a russian " hit squad " because of his openly critical views of the kremlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german authorities have been investigating in the case of kovtun since friday " obviously , it was not -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin himself , of course not , " the 44-year-old told the mail on sunday .
" but what putin does around him in russia makes it possible to kill a british person on british soil .
i believe that it could have been the russian authorities . " marina litvinenko told the british press her husband immediately suspected he had been poisoned when he first fell ill on nov .
1 . the former lieutenant-colonel in the federal security services -lrb- fsb -rrb- who fell out with moscow over the conflict in chechnya died three weeks later after large quantities of polonium 210 were found in his body . litvinenko and his father valter 's accusations against putin were supported sunday by the former agent 's friend , vladimir bukovsky , who told the bbc he was convinced of " clear " russian involvement .
moscow has launched its own probe , but associates of litvinenko said they would only cooperate with russian investigators if their safety were guaranteed . a british channel 4 television report this week quoted a senior british police source as saying that they believed litvinenko was poisoned at the central london hotel where he met three russian contacts on nov .
1 . the probe widened to germany after hamburg police found that kovtun was registered with the city 's immigration authorities and found that he still owned a home there . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ministers meet over poisoning of ex-russian spy the death of a former russian spy by radioactive poison has strained eu relations with moscow , especially considering allegations that the kremlin was involved .

a first wave of three or four countries was expected to be ready by january 2007 . but the forecasters failed to take into account that there would be governments that were able but unwilling to adopt the euro , others that were willing but unable , and some that were neither willing nor able .
in the end , the club will gain just one new member on jan .
1 , when slovenia 's two million inhabitants give up their tolars .
fast-growing baltics disappointed cyprus ' population of 750,000 and the 400,000 maltese are expected to swap their pounds and liras the following year .
slovakia , with a population of 5.4 million , is also on course to switch from the koruna in january 2009 , despite the formation earlier this year of a coalition government including euro-skeptic populists and the far right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : come january , one more country will join the euro but things are looking more complicated for the six other countries that joined the eu two years ago , taking the bloc 's membership to 25 . the baltic nations of lithuania and estonia had hoped to join the euro zone in 2007 .
in theory , nothing could have been easier .
the lithuanian lita and the estonian kroon are tied to the euro and the health of their public finances , a key measure for euro-zone membership , causes envy in countries like france or germany .
but both are experiencing spectacular growth - in estonia the rate was 12 percent in the third quarter alone - and consumer prices are rising slightly faster than in the rest of the eu . the maastricht treaty , which laid the foundations of the euro zone , sets inflation caps for members , and the baltic states have been just shy of the target .
lithuania was annoyed that it did not get a green light earlier this year .
in march , its average inflation rate was just 0.06 percent above the limit . the stern stance of the 12 euro-zone members towards potential members was a surprise for economists , who say the inflation criteria are irrelevant for countries that are catching up with western europe and have already pegged their currencies to the euro . in order to achieve the living standards of the eu 's western members , the former communist countries have little choice but to let salaries and prices increase , which inevitably fuels inflation .
indulgence was then the current intransigence contrasts with the indulgence toward euro-zone founders such as belgium and italy .
both were allowed to adopt the single currency even though their public debt represented more than 100 percent of their gross domestic product .
under euro-zone rules , the maximum is supposed to be 60 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank chief jean-claude trichet while they are solid supporters of the euro , the baltic states have bitterly resigned themselves to having to wait - but are making their discontent known . " it would not be very good if the otherwise good performing countries are left out of the euro area for an extended period , just because of the inflation criterion , " estonian finance minister aivar soerd told afp . apart from slovakia , other new eu members in central europe have put the euro on the back burner .
poland , where euro-skeptic conservatives have been in power for a year , has declined to fix a timetable , simply saying that it aims to hold a referendum in 2010 on whether to give up the zloty - even though joining the single currency was one of the planks of the eu membership treaty already approved by polish voters in 2003 .
warsaw points to the example of sweden , which joined the eu in 1995 and decided to keep the krona after a referendum in 2003 . hungary , which faces a plunging public deficit , has pushed its euro-zone target back to 2013 , while the czech republic is planning to join in 2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu accepts slovenia , rejects lithuania as euro zone member the european commission gave slovenia a green light tuesday to join europe 's single currency next year , but held off on offering approval to lithuania .

despite surviving for 26 years , environmental organization greenpeace 's german branch is now experiencing a lack of funding which could make fighting the good fight even harder . the renowned environmental organization greenpeace focuses on the most crucial worldwide threats to the environment .
its high profile and spectacular campaigns have ensured that greenpeace remains the most high profile environmental group on the planet . greenpeace has offices in 40 countries across europe , the americas , asia and the pacific , and established its german branch in hamburg in 1980 .
greenpeace has relied mostly on donations and membership fees to maintain its global reach and its ability to the stage protests anywhere in the world . now , however , the organization has to cut back on expenses .
greenpeace 's german branch , with its annual 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 53 million -rrb- budget in donations , will have to tighten its belt - and cut about three million euros in costs per year . income decreases as expenses rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive publicity stunts are eating into funds managing director brigitte behrens has refuted claims that the current financial situation at greenpeace is a problem of mismanagement .
" no , our donations are stable , " behrens said , " but they 're not increasing at the rate our costs are . " last year alone , the german branch spent hundreds of thousands of euros more than it brought in .
as a result , costs will have to be reduced as of 2008 - and the largest cuts will be in the personnel sector .
works council representative christiane sattler said the 217 employees in hamburg fear for their jobs . " people are n't in a good mood because it 's going to be a tough cut , " sattler said .
" we do n't yet know who will lose their jobs , and what the concept for 2008 will be .
we have n't been given details yet . " management and the works council plan to have worked out a concept by april next year . " there 's been quite a lot of restructuring on an international level over the past two years , and we at greenpeace germany want to more strongly support international campaigns , " brigitte behrens said .
" our branch , for example , is contributing to a new greenpeace ship . " the rainbow warrior ii is expected to cost 15 million euros , and the german branch , said to be the richest , plans to foot about half of that bill . job cuts go against philosophy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace staff are in danger of being cut works council representative sattler agreed that after 26 years , it was time for some changes and readjustment .
" of course we 're proud to be part of an international organization , " she said . " the organization 's international work is especially important ; it 's just that being told to slash jobs is a bit of a contradiction for an organization that was always big on employee participation . " the organization 's values , like fairness and justice , should also apply to employees , sattler added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .

handicapped students are often reluctant to remind their colleagues or their teachers about the microphones , which sometimes means they can not follow discussions . challenging examinations disabilities are a particular challenge during examinations , even though students are given extensions for their exams or allowed to take them in separate rooms .

" my first oral will be a part of the state examination , and , in this case , i can ask for a quiet room , for instance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.12.2006 german students with disabilities overcome college hurdles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students with disabilities need to leap various institutional hurdles a hearing impairment is no visible handicap , yet many hearing-impaired students in germany are hesitant to talk about it .
for some , the university is actually the first opportunity to meet other people with disabilities . according to a survey by the german student union , some 15 percent of german students have a disability or are chronically ill .
in addition to attending lectures , making photocopies and taking coffee breaks , students with disabilities also need to deal with a lot of administrative paperwork .
getting appropriate hearing aids , reading devices for the blind or transportation services for wheelchair users often necessitates an elaborate application process . " there is a large number of assistance options that are relatively independent of the kind of handicap , " said dr. maike gattermann-kasper , who advises handicapped and chronically ill students at the university of hamburg and helps them with their paperwork . " many students need special examination conditions .
we advise them and discuss how their special cases can be accommodated .
things do n't depend only on the handicap itself , but also on the requirements in the given subject or course of study , " she said . comparing notes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 15 percent of german students have a disability or are chronically ill there are around 20 deaf and numerous hearing-impaired students at the university of hamburg . some of them had never come into contact with other people with disabilities before coming to college . " only at the university did i actually meet other hearing-impaired students , " said zoe , a hearing-impaired student at the university of hamburg who had previously attended a regular high school . " i actually did n't have any contact with other hearing-impaired people before .
i did n't think that was so bad at the time , but now i think it 's really nice being able to compare notes with others , " she said . overcoming the disability deaf-mute or hearing-impaired students at the university of hamburg have interpreters who translate lectures and seminars into sign language .
additionally , students can request the service of a typist who can compile lecture notes for them or they can use special audio devices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may 2006 , germany passed a broad anti-discrimination law " i use an fm device in my studies , " zoe said .
" fm stands for frequency modulation .
it 's similar to a cell phone .
it has a transmitter , which is like a microphone that emits acoustic signals , or what is being said , to the hearing aid . " even though the system functions well , other students often forget to pass the microphone or the professor forgets to use one .
handicapped students are often reluctant to remind their colleagues or their teachers about the microphones , which sometimes means they can not follow discussions . challenging examinations disabilities are a particular challenge during examinations , even though students are given extensions for their exams or allowed to take them in separate rooms . " i did n't have to take any oral examination until now , " said anna , another hearing-impaired student , who is now preparing for her state examination in special education .
" my first oral will be a part of the state examination , and , in this case , i can ask for a quiet room , for instance . " many students , like anna , say that they are torn between not wanting to be treated as handicapped all the time and , on the other hand , often wishing that those around them were a little more mindful of their situation . " that 's why i like horse-back riding , " anna said .
" when i go riding , my hearing impediment or my disability are not in the foreground .
the main topic is the horse .
and the disability plays no role at all .

a first wave of three or four countries was expected to be ready by january 2007 . but the forecasters failed to take into account that there would be governments that were able but unwilling to adopt the euro , others that were willing but unable , and some that were neither willing nor able .
in the end , the club will gain just one new member on jan .
1 , when slovenia 's two million inhabitants give up their tolars .
fast-growing baltics disappointed cyprus ' population of 750,000 and the 400,000 maltese are expected to swap their pounds and liras the following year .
slovakia , with a population of 5.4 million , is also on course to switch from the koruna in january 2009 , despite the formation earlier this year of a coalition government including euro-skeptic populists and the far right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : come january , one more country will join the euro but things are looking more complicated for the six other countries that joined the eu two years ago , taking the bloc 's membership to 25 . the baltic nations of lithuania and estonia had hoped to join the euro zone in 2007 .
in theory , nothing could have been easier .
the lithuanian lita and the estonian kroon are tied to the euro and the health of their public finances , a key measure for euro-zone membership , causes envy in countries like france or germany .
but both are experiencing spectacular growth - in estonia the rate was 12 percent in the third quarter alone - and consumer prices are rising slightly faster than in the rest of the eu . the maastricht treaty , which laid the foundations of the euro zone , sets inflation caps for members , and the baltic states have been just shy of the target .
lithuania was annoyed that it did not get a green light earlier this year .
in march , its average inflation rate was just 0.06 percent above the limit . the stern stance of the 12 euro-zone members towards potential members was a surprise for economists , who say the inflation criteria are irrelevant for countries that are catching up with western europe and have already pegged their currencies to the euro . in order to achieve the living standards of the eu 's western members , the former communist countries have little choice but to let salaries and prices increase , which inevitably fuels inflation .
indulgence was then the current intransigence contrasts with the indulgence toward euro-zone founders such as belgium and italy .
both were allowed to adopt the single currency even though their public debt represented more than 100 percent of their gross domestic product .
under euro-zone rules , the maximum is supposed to be 60 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank chief jean-claude trichet while they are solid supporters of the euro , the baltic states have bitterly resigned themselves to having to wait - but are making their discontent known .

despite surviving for 26 years , environmental organization greenpeace 's german branch is now experiencing a lack of funding which could make fighting the good fight even harder . the renowned environmental organization greenpeace focuses on the most crucial worldwide threats to the environment .
its high profile and spectacular campaigns have ensured that greenpeace remains the most high profile environmental group on the planet . greenpeace has offices in 40 countries across europe , the americas , asia and the pacific , and established its german branch in hamburg in 1980 .
greenpeace has relied mostly on donations and membership fees to maintain its global reach and its ability to the stage protests anywhere in the world . now , however , the organization has to cut back on expenses .
greenpeace 's german branch , with its annual 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 53 million -rrb- budget in donations , will have to tighten its belt - and cut about three million euros in costs per year . income decreases as expenses rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive publicity stunts are eating into funds managing director brigitte behrens has refuted claims that the current financial situation at greenpeace is a problem of mismanagement .
" no , our donations are stable , " behrens said , " but they 're not increasing at the rate our costs are . " last year alone , the german branch spent hundreds of thousands of euros more than it brought in .
as a result , costs will have to be reduced as of 2008 - and the largest cuts will be in the personnel sector .
works council representative christiane sattler said the 217 employees in hamburg fear for their jobs . " people are n't in a good mood because it 's going to be a tough cut , " sattler said .
" we do n't yet know who will lose their jobs , and what the concept for 2008 will be .
we have n't been given details yet . " management and the works council plan to have worked out a concept by april next year . " there 's been quite a lot of restructuring on an international level over the past two years , and we at greenpeace germany want to more strongly support international campaigns , " brigitte behrens said .
" our branch , for example , is contributing to a new greenpeace ship . " the rainbow warrior ii is expected to cost 15 million euros , and the german branch , said to be the richest , plans to foot about half of that bill . job cuts go against philosophy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace staff are in danger of being cut works council representative sattler agreed that after 26 years , it was time for some changes and readjustment .
" of course we 're proud to be part of an international organization , " she said . " the organization 's international work is especially important ; it 's just that being told to slash jobs is a bit of a contradiction for an organization that was always big on employee participation . " the organization 's values , like fairness and justice , should also apply to employees , sattler added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .

for some , the university is actually the first opportunity to meet other people with disabilities . according to a survey by the german student union , some 15 percent of german students have a disability or are chronically ill .
in addition to attending lectures , making photocopies and taking coffee breaks , students with disabilities also need to deal with a lot of administrative paperwork .
getting appropriate hearing aids , reading devices for the blind or transportation services for wheelchair users often necessitates an elaborate application process . " there is a large number of assistance options that are relatively independent of the kind of handicap , " said dr. maike gattermann-kasper , who advises handicapped and chronically ill students at the university of hamburg and helps them with their paperwork .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency european union -pipe- 10.12.2006 major euro-zone expansion on hold until next decade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's founders are tougher on newcomers five years after 12 eu members switched to the single european currency , hopes for a rapid expansion of the euro zone have been dashed by delays in eastern europe and a lack of interest from west european holdouts . in 2002 , 304 million european citizens in countries including france , germany , ireland and spain waved goodbye to their francs , marks , punts and pesetas , and expectations were high that they would be joined by millions more by the end of the decade . with the exception of britain and denmark , which have special euro-zone opt-outs , all european union members are supposed eventually to make the euro their official currency . economists at the time predicted that the 10 countries which joined the eu in 2004 , mostly former members of the communist bloc , would adopt the euro no later than 2010 .
a first wave of three or four countries was expected to be ready by january 2007 . but the forecasters failed to take into account that there would be governments that were able but unwilling to adopt the euro , others that were willing but unable , and some that were neither willing nor able .
in the end , the club will gain just one new member on jan .
1 , when slovenia 's two million inhabitants give up their tolars .
fast-growing baltics disappointed cyprus ' population of 750,000 and the 400,000 maltese are expected to swap their pounds and liras the following year .
slovakia , with a population of 5.4 million , is also on course to switch from the koruna in january 2009 , despite the formation earlier this year of a coalition government including euro-skeptic populists and the far right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : come january , one more country will join the euro but things are looking more complicated for the six other countries that joined the eu two years ago , taking the bloc 's membership to 25 . the baltic nations of lithuania and estonia had hoped to join the euro zone in 2007 .
in theory , nothing could have been easier .
the lithuanian lita and the estonian kroon are tied to the euro and the health of their public finances , a key measure for euro-zone membership , causes envy in countries like france or germany .
but both are experiencing spectacular growth - in estonia the rate was 12 percent in the third quarter alone - and consumer prices are rising slightly faster than in the rest of the eu . the maastricht treaty , which laid the foundations of the euro zone , sets inflation caps for members , and the baltic states have been just shy of the target .
lithuania was annoyed that it did not get a green light earlier this year .
in march , its average inflation rate was just 0.06 percent above the limit . the stern stance of the 12 euro-zone members towards potential members was a surprise for economists , who say the inflation criteria are irrelevant for countries that are catching up with western europe and have already pegged their currencies to the euro . in order to achieve the living standards of the eu 's western members , the former communist countries have little choice but to let salaries and prices increase , which inevitably fuels inflation .

warsaw points to the example of sweden , which joined the eu in 1995 and decided to keep the krona after a referendum in 2003 . hungary , which faces a plunging public deficit , has pushed its euro-zone target back to 2013 , while the czech republic is planning to join in 2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu accepts slovenia , rejects lithuania as euro zone member the european commission gave slovenia a green light tuesday to join europe 's single currency next year , but held off on offering approval to lithuania .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency european union -pipe- 10.12.2006 major euro-zone expansion on hold until next decade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's founders are tougher on newcomers five years after 12 eu members switched to the single european currency , hopes for a rapid expansion of the euro zone have been dashed by delays in eastern europe and a lack of interest from west european holdouts . in 2002 , 304 million european citizens in countries including france , germany , ireland and spain waved goodbye to their francs , marks , punts and pesetas , and expectations were high that they would be joined by millions more by the end of the decade . with the exception of britain and denmark , which have special euro-zone opt-outs , all european union members are supposed eventually to make the euro their official currency . economists at the time predicted that the 10 countries which joined the eu in 2004 , mostly former members of the communist bloc , would adopt the euro no later than 2010 .
a first wave of three or four countries was expected to be ready by january 2007 . but the forecasters failed to take into account that there would be governments that were able but unwilling to adopt the euro , others that were willing but unable , and some that were neither willing nor able .
in the end , the club will gain just one new member on jan .
1 , when slovenia 's two million inhabitants give up their tolars .
fast-growing baltics disappointed cyprus ' population of 750,000 and the 400,000 maltese are expected to swap their pounds and liras the following year .
slovakia , with a population of 5.4 million , is also on course to switch from the koruna in january 2009 , despite the formation earlier this year of a coalition government including euro-skeptic populists and the far right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : come january , one more country will join the euro but things are looking more complicated for the six other countries that joined the eu two years ago , taking the bloc 's membership to 25 . the baltic nations of lithuania and estonia had hoped to join the euro zone in 2007 .
in theory , nothing could have been easier .
the lithuanian lita and the estonian kroon are tied to the euro and the health of their public finances , a key measure for euro-zone membership , causes envy in countries like france or germany .
but both are experiencing spectacular growth - in estonia the rate was 12 percent in the third quarter alone - and consumer prices are rising slightly faster than in the rest of the eu . the maastricht treaty , which laid the foundations of the euro zone , sets inflation caps for members , and the baltic states have been just shy of the target .
lithuania was annoyed that it did not get a green light earlier this year .
in march , its average inflation rate was just 0.06 percent above the limit . the stern stance of the 12 euro-zone members towards potential members was a surprise for economists , who say the inflation criteria are irrelevant for countries that are catching up with western europe and have already pegged their currencies to the euro . in order to achieve the living standards of the eu 's western members , the former communist countries have little choice but to let salaries and prices increase , which inevitably fuels inflation .
indulgence was then the current intransigence contrasts with the indulgence toward euro-zone founders such as belgium and italy .
both were allowed to adopt the single currency even though their public debt represented more than 100 percent of their gross domestic product .
under euro-zone rules , the maximum is supposed to be 60 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank chief jean-claude trichet while they are solid supporters of the euro , the baltic states have bitterly resigned themselves to having to wait - but are making their discontent known . " it would not be very good if the otherwise good performing countries are left out of the euro area for an extended period , just because of the inflation criterion , " estonian finance minister aivar soerd told afp . apart from slovakia , other new eu members in central europe have put the euro on the back burner .
poland , where euro-skeptic conservatives have been in power for a year , has declined to fix a timetable , simply saying that it aims to hold a referendum in 2010 on whether to give up the zloty - even though joining the single currency was one of the planks of the eu membership treaty already approved by polish voters in 2003 .
warsaw points to the example of sweden , which joined the eu in 1995 and decided to keep the krona after a referendum in 2003 . hungary , which faces a plunging public deficit , has pushed its euro-zone target back to 2013 , while the czech republic is planning to join in 2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu accepts slovenia , rejects lithuania as euro zone member the european commission gave slovenia a green light tuesday to join europe 's single currency next year , but held off on offering approval to lithuania .

kovtun has also been hospitalized with severe radioactive poisoning . " he appeared to have been in active contact with polonium .

moscow has launched its own probe , but associates of litvinenko said they would only cooperate with russian investigators if their safety were guaranteed . a british channel 4 television report this week quoted a senior british police source as saying that they believed litvinenko was poisoned at the central london hotel where he met three russian contacts on nov .

for some , the university is actually the first opportunity to meet other people with disabilities . according to a survey by the german student union , some 15 percent of german students have a disability or are chronically ill .
in addition to attending lectures , making photocopies and taking coffee breaks , students with disabilities also need to deal with a lot of administrative paperwork .
getting appropriate hearing aids , reading devices for the blind or transportation services for wheelchair users often necessitates an elaborate application process . " there is a large number of assistance options that are relatively independent of the kind of handicap , " said dr. maike gattermann-kasper , who advises handicapped and chronically ill students at the university of hamburg and helps them with their paperwork . " many students need special examination conditions .
we advise them and discuss how their special cases can be accommodated .
things do n't depend only on the handicap itself , but also on the requirements in the given subject or course of study , " she said . comparing notes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 15 percent of german students have a disability or are chronically ill there are around 20 deaf and numerous hearing-impaired students at the university of hamburg . some of them had never come into contact with other people with disabilities before coming to college . " only at the university did i actually meet other hearing-impaired students , " said zoe , a hearing-impaired student at the university of hamburg who had previously attended a regular high school . " i actually did n't have any contact with other hearing-impaired people before .
i did n't think that was so bad at the time , but now i think it 's really nice being able to compare notes with others , " she said . overcoming the disability deaf-mute or hearing-impaired students at the university of hamburg have interpreters who translate lectures and seminars into sign language .
additionally , students can request the service of a typist who can compile lecture notes for them or they can use special audio devices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may 2006 , germany passed a broad anti-discrimination law " i use an fm device in my studies , " zoe said .
" fm stands for frequency modulation .
it 's similar to a cell phone .
it has a transmitter , which is like a microphone that emits acoustic signals , or what is being said , to the hearing aid . " even though the system functions well , other students often forget to pass the microphone or the professor forgets to use one .
handicapped students are often reluctant to remind their colleagues or their teachers about the microphones , which sometimes means they can not follow discussions . challenging examinations disabilities are a particular challenge during examinations , even though students are given extensions for their exams or allowed to take them in separate rooms . " i did n't have to take any oral examination until now , " said anna , another hearing-impaired student , who is now preparing for her state examination in special education .
" my first oral will be a part of the state examination , and , in this case , i can ask for a quiet room , for instance . " many students , like anna , say that they are torn between not wanting to be treated as handicapped all the time and , on the other hand , often wishing that those around them were a little more mindful of their situation . " that 's why i like horse-back riding , " anna said .
" when i go riding , my hearing impediment or my disability are not in the foreground .
the main topic is the horse .
and the disability plays no role at all .

and why are the french always puzzled when they look at a skylight ?
it 's because they use words of german origin , sometimes without even realizing it . many students of the german language - especially those who suffered their way through cruel , teutonic grammar drills , lost their sense of orientation trying to order their german words correctly , or wounded both their tongues and sense of self-esteem with sharp , unpronounceable compound words - get rather surprised when they come to germany and hear the language of goethe in actual use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german grammar is not for the faint of heart people in germany are often invited to attend " ein meeting , " asked to bring along their " down-geloadete " information and told " sorry " -lrb- with a rolling " r " -rrb- when somebody bumps into them on the street . but - even in the age of digital communication , dominated by the english language and us american pop culture - it is not only english words that cross national and linguistic borders . the german language council recently organized an international contest called " word migrations . "
people from 70 countries - ranging from mexico to singapore , malaysia and south korea to nigeria - participated in the linguistic hunt for german words that " migrated " to other languages .
over 6,000 such words were submitted .
a winner was drawn from the entries and the award ceremony took place thursday in munich . coffee break par excellence " the response to our first advertisement was enormous , " said rudolf hoberg of the association for the german language , one of the organizations participating in the german language council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german buses rarely need to go for a coffee break the winning entry also showed that germany is not only a language of profound philosophy and utmost , technical efficiency , but also a language of leisure and procrastination . susanne bätjer from germany was wondering why a finnish public-transit bus , which she saw in 2005 , had the word " kaffepaussi " displayed on its automated destination display .
do finnish buses really take coffee breaks ?
bätjer learned in the end that the german word for coffee break had acquired an additional , slightly different , meaning in finnish : " out of order . " some german words - such as kindergarten , zeitgeist , and sauerkraut - have long been known as german imports into the english language .
but the goal of the project was to go beyond the obvious examples and explore the extent to which german words have infiltrated other languages . " we wanted to find out what german words are used on an everyday basis in other countries , " hoberg said . a colorful collection the results of this survey - which one could best place in the category of linguistic anthropology - told a fascinating story of german technical expertise , colonial history , cultural stereotypes and a delightful sense of humor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodka is a great way to spread international understanding the turkish rail system was started in 1913 with german assistance , which is why turkish train conductors always cry " fertik " -lrb- " fertig " - ready or finished in german -rrb- when the train is about to leave the station .
in cameroon , once a german colony , train stations are called " banop " -lrb- " bahnhof " -rrb- .
if one is anesthetized in tanzania , they are - all joking aside - " nusu kaput " -lrb- half-broken -rrb- .
in afrikaans , the language of dutch settlers in south africa , an impatient german is an " aberjetzte " -lrb- " aber jetzt " in german means " on the double " or " asap " -rrb- . " the vocabulary of the german language is far better known abroad than we thought , " hoberg said . and even though contributions came from all over the word - the russians raise a glass of vodka to " brudershaft , " a gesture of friendship and brotherhood -lrb- german " brüderschaft " -rrb- , while some american presidential candidates can be best described as wishy-washy -lrb- from german " wischi-waschi , " lacking a clear-cut standpoint -rrb- - most of the words were submitted from eastern europe and anglo-saxon cultural areas . what 's that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is for many students an excercise in delayed gratification it may come as a surprise , however , that the most frequently submitted entry was the french word for skylight - " vasistas . "
in the original german , " was ist das " means , literally , " what 's that ? "
yet most french speakers probably do n't pay attention to the fact that skylights in french provoke , etymologically speaking , a sense of puzzled inquiry about the state of the world . it is also unlikely that japanese students who have an odd student job called " arubaito " realize that they are , from an etymological point of view , part of germany 's labor-intensive work culture -lrb- " arbeit " means work in german -rrb- . " the project does not attempt a linguistic investigation , " hoberg said .
" some words that were sent in might well be only passing fads . " whether as temporary guest workers in foreign languages , or as naturalized citizens , german words have long left the confines of the german-speaking world .
a large collection of colorful cross-linguistic gems - along with personal anecdotes and insights into the way cultures collide and enrich each other - has now been collected and published as a book under the title " ausgewanderte wörter " -lrb- available in german only -rrb- . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mcdeutsch – is the german language going global ?
didn ’ t the german language make its international mark a long time ago with goethe , kant and co . ?
is there any room for modernity - or global thinking ?
those behind the " mcdeutsch " project want to find out .

you guessed it : they all come from the language of goethe , thomas mann and rammstein .

schalke stands at number two after beating dortmund 3-1 . schalke 04 moved back level with werder bremen at the top of the german bundesliga with a convincing 3-1 victory over local rival borussia dortmund on sunday .
goals from christian pander , kevin kuranyi and peter loevenkrands before a late dortmund consolation gave schalke their sixth victory in seven games . on saturday , thomas schaaf 's side nearly made up for the disappointment of getting dumped out of the champions league by barcelona in midweek .
if the bremen players were suffering any hangover from that barca defeat it certainly did n't show , with brazilian defender naldo putting them into the lead after three minutes play .
marco russ had frankfurt back on level terms a minute later , but that only served to invigorate bremen . danish midfielder daniel jensen put the visitor 's back in front in the 11th minute , with naldo increasing their advantage on the half hour .
and the defender whom schaaf reckons is the most talented in brazil popped up with a third just after the break with jurica vranjes and diego completing the rout in the dying minutes . sotorios kyrgiakos bagged a late consolation for the hosts .

kovtun has also been hospitalized with severe radioactive poisoning . " he appeared to have been in active contact with polonium .
we are considering him as a suspect also , " hamburg state prosecutor martin koehnke said .

moscow has launched its own probe , but associates of litvinenko said they would only cooperate with russian investigators if their safety were guaranteed . a british channel 4 television report this week quoted a senior british police source as saying that they believed litvinenko was poisoned at the central london hotel where he met three russian contacts on nov .

" we found radiation in the car in which he drove after he arrived in hamburg from russia on october 28 and in a document he signed at the immigration offices , " menzel told reporters . investigators have also found traces of polonium 210 on the couch in kovtun 's ex-wife 's flat where he slept on the night of oct .

kovtun has also been hospitalized with severe radioactive poisoning . " he appeared to have been in active contact with polonium .
we are considering him as a suspect also , " hamburg state prosecutor martin koehnke said .

and why are the french always puzzled when they look at a skylight ?
it 's because they use words of german origin , sometimes without even realizing it . many students of the german language - especially those who suffered their way through cruel , teutonic grammar drills , lost their sense of orientation trying to order their german words correctly , or wounded both their tongues and sense of self-esteem with sharp , unpronounceable compound words - get rather surprised when they come to germany and hear the language of goethe in actual use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german grammar is not for the faint of heart people in germany are often invited to attend " ein meeting , " asked to bring along their " down-geloadete " information and told " sorry " -lrb- with a rolling " r " -rrb- when somebody bumps into them on the street . but - even in the age of digital communication , dominated by the english language and us american pop culture - it is not only english words that cross national and linguistic borders . the german language council recently organized an international contest called " word migrations . "
people from 70 countries - ranging from mexico to singapore , malaysia and south korea to nigeria - participated in the linguistic hunt for german words that " migrated " to other languages .
over 6,000 such words were submitted .
a winner was drawn from the entries and the award ceremony took place thursday in munich . coffee break par excellence " the response to our first advertisement was enormous , " said rudolf hoberg of the association for the german language , one of the organizations participating in the german language council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german buses rarely need to go for a coffee break the winning entry also showed that germany is not only a language of profound philosophy and utmost , technical efficiency , but also a language of leisure and procrastination . susanne bätjer from germany was wondering why a finnish public-transit bus , which she saw in 2005 , had the word " kaffepaussi " displayed on its automated destination display .
do finnish buses really take coffee breaks ?
bätjer learned in the end that the german word for coffee break had acquired an additional , slightly different , meaning in finnish : " out of order . " some german words - such as kindergarten , zeitgeist , and sauerkraut - have long been known as german imports into the english language .
but the goal of the project was to go beyond the obvious examples and explore the extent to which german words have infiltrated other languages . " we wanted to find out what german words are used on an everyday basis in other countries , " hoberg said . a colorful collection the results of this survey - which one could best place in the category of linguistic anthropology - told a fascinating story of german technical expertise , colonial history , cultural stereotypes and a delightful sense of humor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodka is a great way to spread international understanding the turkish rail system was started in 1913 with german assistance , which is why turkish train conductors always cry " fertik " -lrb- " fertig " - ready or finished in german -rrb- when the train is about to leave the station .
in cameroon , once a german colony , train stations are called " banop " -lrb- " bahnhof " -rrb- .

and why are the french always puzzled when they look at a skylight ?
it 's because they use words of german origin , sometimes without even realizing it . many students of the german language - especially those who suffered their way through cruel , teutonic grammar drills , lost their sense of orientation trying to order their german words correctly , or wounded both their tongues and sense of self-esteem with sharp , unpronounceable compound words - get rather surprised when they come to germany and hear the language of goethe in actual use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german grammar is not for the faint of heart people in germany are often invited to attend " ein meeting , " asked to bring along their " down-geloadete " information and told " sorry " -lrb- with a rolling " r " -rrb- when somebody bumps into them on the street . but - even in the age of digital communication , dominated by the english language and us american pop culture - it is not only english words that cross national and linguistic borders . the german language council recently organized an international contest called " word migrations . "
people from 70 countries - ranging from mexico to singapore , malaysia and south korea to nigeria - participated in the linguistic hunt for german words that " migrated " to other languages .
over 6,000 such words were submitted .
a winner was drawn from the entries and the award ceremony took place thursday in munich . coffee break par excellence " the response to our first advertisement was enormous , " said rudolf hoberg of the association for the german language , one of the organizations participating in the german language council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german buses rarely need to go for a coffee break the winning entry also showed that germany is not only a language of profound philosophy and utmost , technical efficiency , but also a language of leisure and procrastination . susanne bätjer from germany was wondering why a finnish public-transit bus , which she saw in 2005 , had the word " kaffepaussi " displayed on its automated destination display .
do finnish buses really take coffee breaks ?
bätjer learned in the end that the german word for coffee break had acquired an additional , slightly different , meaning in finnish : " out of order . " some german words - such as kindergarten , zeitgeist , and sauerkraut - have long been known as german imports into the english language .
but the goal of the project was to go beyond the obvious examples and explore the extent to which german words have infiltrated other languages . " we wanted to find out what german words are used on an everyday basis in other countries , " hoberg said . a colorful collection the results of this survey - which one could best place in the category of linguistic anthropology - told a fascinating story of german technical expertise , colonial history , cultural stereotypes and a delightful sense of humor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodka is a great way to spread international understanding the turkish rail system was started in 1913 with german assistance , which is why turkish train conductors always cry " fertik " -lrb- " fertig " - ready or finished in german -rrb- when the train is about to leave the station .
in cameroon , once a german colony , train stations are called " banop " -lrb- " bahnhof " -rrb- .

" we found radiation in the car in which he drove after he arrived in hamburg from russia on october 28 and in a document he signed at the immigration offices , " menzel told reporters . investigators have also found traces of polonium 210 on the couch in kovtun 's ex-wife 's flat where he slept on the night of oct .

kovtun has also been hospitalized with severe radioactive poisoning . " he appeared to have been in active contact with polonium .
we are considering him as a suspect also , " hamburg state prosecutor martin koehnke said .
" we have to establish whether he was poisoned himself or carried the polonium into the country , " koehnke said . he said german investigators would share all evidence they uncover with british counterparts probing the murder which friends and family of the victim have blamed squarely on the russian government . litvinenko 's widow blames " hit squad " in her first public interviews since his death on nov .

moscow has launched its own probe , but associates of litvinenko said they would only cooperate with russian investigators if their safety were guaranteed . a british channel 4 television report this week quoted a senior british police source as saying that they believed litvinenko was poisoned at the central london hotel where he met three russian contacts on nov .

and why are the french always puzzled when they look at a skylight ?
it 's because they use words of german origin , sometimes without even realizing it . many students of the german language - especially those who suffered their way through cruel , teutonic grammar drills , lost their sense of orientation trying to order their german words correctly , or wounded both their tongues and sense of self-esteem with sharp , unpronounceable compound words - get rather surprised when they come to germany and hear the language of goethe in actual use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german grammar is not for the faint of heart people in germany are often invited to attend " ein meeting , " asked to bring along their " down-geloadete " information and told " sorry " -lrb- with a rolling " r " -rrb- when somebody bumps into them on the street . but - even in the age of digital communication , dominated by the english language and us american pop culture - it is not only english words that cross national and linguistic borders . the german language council recently organized an international contest called " word migrations . "
people from 70 countries - ranging from mexico to singapore , malaysia and south korea to nigeria - participated in the linguistic hunt for german words that " migrated " to other languages .
over 6,000 such words were submitted .
a winner was drawn from the entries and the award ceremony took place thursday in munich . coffee break par excellence " the response to our first advertisement was enormous , " said rudolf hoberg of the association for the german language , one of the organizations participating in the german language council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german buses rarely need to go for a coffee break the winning entry also showed that germany is not only a language of profound philosophy and utmost , technical efficiency , but also a language of leisure and procrastination . susanne bätjer from germany was wondering why a finnish public-transit bus , which she saw in 2005 , had the word " kaffepaussi " displayed on its automated destination display .
do finnish buses really take coffee breaks ?
bätjer learned in the end that the german word for coffee break had acquired an additional , slightly different , meaning in finnish : " out of order . " some german words - such as kindergarten , zeitgeist , and sauerkraut - have long been known as german imports into the english language .
but the goal of the project was to go beyond the obvious examples and explore the extent to which german words have infiltrated other languages . " we wanted to find out what german words are used on an everyday basis in other countries , " hoberg said . a colorful collection the results of this survey - which one could best place in the category of linguistic anthropology - told a fascinating story of german technical expertise , colonial history , cultural stereotypes and a delightful sense of humor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodka is a great way to spread international understanding the turkish rail system was started in 1913 with german assistance , which is why turkish train conductors always cry " fertik " -lrb- " fertig " - ready or finished in german -rrb- when the train is about to leave the station .
in cameroon , once a german colony , train stations are called " banop " -lrb- " bahnhof " -rrb- .
if one is anesthetized in tanzania , they are - all joking aside - " nusu kaput " -lrb- half-broken -rrb- .
in afrikaans , the language of dutch settlers in south africa , an impatient german is an " aberjetzte " -lrb- " aber jetzt " in german means " on the double " or " asap " -rrb- . " the vocabulary of the german language is far better known abroad than we thought , " hoberg said . and even though contributions came from all over the word - the russians raise a glass of vodka to " brudershaft , " a gesture of friendship and brotherhood -lrb- german " brüderschaft " -rrb- , while some american presidential candidates can be best described as wishy-washy -lrb- from german " wischi-waschi , " lacking a clear-cut standpoint -rrb- - most of the words were submitted from eastern europe and anglo-saxon cultural areas . what 's that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is for many students an excercise in delayed gratification it may come as a surprise , however , that the most frequently submitted entry was the french word for skylight - " vasistas . "
in the original german , " was ist das " means , literally , " what 's that ? "
yet most french speakers probably do n't pay attention to the fact that skylights in french provoke , etymologically speaking , a sense of puzzled inquiry about the state of the world . it is also unlikely that japanese students who have an odd student job called " arubaito " realize that they are , from an etymological point of view , part of germany 's labor-intensive work culture -lrb- " arbeit " means work in german -rrb- . " the project does not attempt a linguistic investigation , " hoberg said .
" some words that were sent in might well be only passing fads . " whether as temporary guest workers in foreign languages , or as naturalized citizens , german words have long left the confines of the german-speaking world .
a large collection of colorful cross-linguistic gems - along with personal anecdotes and insights into the way cultures collide and enrich each other - has now been collected and published as a book under the title " ausgewanderte wörter " -lrb- available in german only -rrb- . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mcdeutsch – is the german language going global ?

a first wave of three or four countries was expected to be ready by january 2007 . but the forecasters failed to take into account that there would be governments that were able but unwilling to adopt the euro , others that were willing but unable , and some that were neither willing nor able .
in the end , the club will gain just one new member on jan .
1 , when slovenia 's two million inhabitants give up their tolars .
fast-growing baltics disappointed cyprus ' population of 750,000 and the 400,000 maltese are expected to swap their pounds and liras the following year .
slovakia , with a population of 5.4 million , is also on course to switch from the koruna in january 2009 , despite the formation earlier this year of a coalition government including euro-skeptic populists and the far right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : come january , one more country will join the euro but things are looking more complicated for the six other countries that joined the eu two years ago , taking the bloc 's membership to 25 . the baltic nations of lithuania and estonia had hoped to join the euro zone in 2007 .
in theory , nothing could have been easier .
the lithuanian lita and the estonian kroon are tied to the euro and the health of their public finances , a key measure for euro-zone membership , causes envy in countries like france or germany .
but both are experiencing spectacular growth - in estonia the rate was 12 percent in the third quarter alone - and consumer prices are rising slightly faster than in the rest of the eu . the maastricht treaty , which laid the foundations of the euro zone , sets inflation caps for members , and the baltic states have been just shy of the target .
lithuania was annoyed that it did not get a green light earlier this year .
in march , its average inflation rate was just 0.06 percent above the limit . the stern stance of the 12 euro-zone members towards potential members was a surprise for economists , who say the inflation criteria are irrelevant for countries that are catching up with western europe and have already pegged their currencies to the euro . in order to achieve the living standards of the eu 's western members , the former communist countries have little choice but to let salaries and prices increase , which inevitably fuels inflation .
indulgence was then the current intransigence contrasts with the indulgence toward euro-zone founders such as belgium and italy .
both were allowed to adopt the single currency even though their public debt represented more than 100 percent of their gross domestic product .
under euro-zone rules , the maximum is supposed to be 60 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank chief jean-claude trichet while they are solid supporters of the euro , the baltic states have bitterly resigned themselves to having to wait - but are making their discontent known . " it would not be very good if the otherwise good performing countries are left out of the euro area for an extended period , just because of the inflation criterion , " estonian finance minister aivar soerd told afp . apart from slovakia , other new eu members in central europe have put the euro on the back burner .
poland , where euro-skeptic conservatives have been in power for a year , has declined to fix a timetable , simply saying that it aims to hold a referendum in 2010 on whether to give up the zloty - even though joining the single currency was one of the planks of the eu membership treaty already approved by polish voters in 2003 .
warsaw points to the example of sweden , which joined the eu in 1995 and decided to keep the krona after a referendum in 2003 . hungary , which faces a plunging public deficit , has pushed its euro-zone target back to 2013 , while the czech republic is planning to join in 2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu accepts slovenia , rejects lithuania as euro zone member the european commission gave slovenia a green light tuesday to join europe 's single currency next year , but held off on offering approval to lithuania .

and why are the french always puzzled when they look at a skylight ?
it 's because they use words of german origin , sometimes without even realizing it . many students of the german language - especially those who suffered their way through cruel , teutonic grammar drills , lost their sense of orientation trying to order their german words correctly , or wounded both their tongues and sense of self-esteem with sharp , unpronounceable compound words - get rather surprised when they come to germany and hear the language of goethe in actual use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german grammar is not for the faint of heart people in germany are often invited to attend " ein meeting , " asked to bring along their " down-geloadete " information and told " sorry " -lrb- with a rolling " r " -rrb- when somebody bumps into them on the street . but - even in the age of digital communication , dominated by the english language and us american pop culture - it is not only english words that cross national and linguistic borders . the german language council recently organized an international contest called " word migrations . "
people from 70 countries - ranging from mexico to singapore , malaysia and south korea to nigeria - participated in the linguistic hunt for german words that " migrated " to other languages .
over 6,000 such words were submitted .
a winner was drawn from the entries and the award ceremony took place thursday in munich . coffee break par excellence " the response to our first advertisement was enormous , " said rudolf hoberg of the association for the german language , one of the organizations participating in the german language council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german buses rarely need to go for a coffee break the winning entry also showed that germany is not only a language of profound philosophy and utmost , technical efficiency , but also a language of leisure and procrastination . susanne bätjer from germany was wondering why a finnish public-transit bus , which she saw in 2005 , had the word " kaffepaussi " displayed on its automated destination display .
do finnish buses really take coffee breaks ?
bätjer learned in the end that the german word for coffee break had acquired an additional , slightly different , meaning in finnish : " out of order . " some german words - such as kindergarten , zeitgeist , and sauerkraut - have long been known as german imports into the english language .
but the goal of the project was to go beyond the obvious examples and explore the extent to which german words have infiltrated other languages . " we wanted to find out what german words are used on an everyday basis in other countries , " hoberg said . a colorful collection the results of this survey - which one could best place in the category of linguistic anthropology - told a fascinating story of german technical expertise , colonial history , cultural stereotypes and a delightful sense of humor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodka is a great way to spread international understanding the turkish rail system was started in 1913 with german assistance , which is why turkish train conductors always cry " fertik " -lrb- " fertig " - ready or finished in german -rrb- when the train is about to leave the station .
in cameroon , once a german colony , train stations are called " banop " -lrb- " bahnhof " -rrb- .
if one is anesthetized in tanzania , they are - all joking aside - " nusu kaput " -lrb- half-broken -rrb- .
in afrikaans , the language of dutch settlers in south africa , an impatient german is an " aberjetzte " -lrb- " aber jetzt " in german means " on the double " or " asap " -rrb- . " the vocabulary of the german language is far better known abroad than we thought , " hoberg said . and even though contributions came from all over the word - the russians raise a glass of vodka to " brudershaft , " a gesture of friendship and brotherhood -lrb- german " brüderschaft " -rrb- , while some american presidential candidates can be best described as wishy-washy -lrb- from german " wischi-waschi , " lacking a clear-cut standpoint -rrb- - most of the words were submitted from eastern europe and anglo-saxon cultural areas . what 's that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is for many students an excercise in delayed gratification it may come as a surprise , however , that the most frequently submitted entry was the french word for skylight - " vasistas . "
in the original german , " was ist das " means , literally , " what 's that ? "
yet most french speakers probably do n't pay attention to the fact that skylights in french provoke , etymologically speaking , a sense of puzzled inquiry about the state of the world . it is also unlikely that japanese students who have an odd student job called " arubaito " realize that they are , from an etymological point of view , part of germany 's labor-intensive work culture -lrb- " arbeit " means work in german -rrb- . " the project does not attempt a linguistic investigation , " hoberg said .
" some words that were sent in might well be only passing fads . " whether as temporary guest workers in foreign languages , or as naturalized citizens , german words have long left the confines of the german-speaking world .

a first wave of three or four countries was expected to be ready by january 2007 . but the forecasters failed to take into account that there would be governments that were able but unwilling to adopt the euro , others that were willing but unable , and some that were neither willing nor able .
in the end , the club will gain just one new member on jan .
1 , when slovenia 's two million inhabitants give up their tolars .
fast-growing baltics disappointed cyprus ' population of 750,000 and the 400,000 maltese are expected to swap their pounds and liras the following year .
slovakia , with a population of 5.4 million , is also on course to switch from the koruna in january 2009 , despite the formation earlier this year of a coalition government including euro-skeptic populists and the far right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : come january , one more country will join the euro but things are looking more complicated for the six other countries that joined the eu two years ago , taking the bloc 's membership to 25 . the baltic nations of lithuania and estonia had hoped to join the euro zone in 2007 .
in theory , nothing could have been easier .
the lithuanian lita and the estonian kroon are tied to the euro and the health of their public finances , a key measure for euro-zone membership , causes envy in countries like france or germany .
but both are experiencing spectacular growth - in estonia the rate was 12 percent in the third quarter alone - and consumer prices are rising slightly faster than in the rest of the eu . the maastricht treaty , which laid the foundations of the euro zone , sets inflation caps for members , and the baltic states have been just shy of the target .
lithuania was annoyed that it did not get a green light earlier this year .
in march , its average inflation rate was just 0.06 percent above the limit . the stern stance of the 12 euro-zone members towards potential members was a surprise for economists , who say the inflation criteria are irrelevant for countries that are catching up with western europe and have already pegged their currencies to the euro . in order to achieve the living standards of the eu 's western members , the former communist countries have little choice but to let salaries and prices increase , which inevitably fuels inflation .
indulgence was then the current intransigence contrasts with the indulgence toward euro-zone founders such as belgium and italy .
both were allowed to adopt the single currency even though their public debt represented more than 100 percent of their gross domestic product .
under euro-zone rules , the maximum is supposed to be 60 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank chief jean-claude trichet while they are solid supporters of the euro , the baltic states have bitterly resigned themselves to having to wait - but are making their discontent known . " it would not be very good if the otherwise good performing countries are left out of the euro area for an extended period , just because of the inflation criterion , " estonian finance minister aivar soerd told afp . apart from slovakia , other new eu members in central europe have put the euro on the back burner .
poland , where euro-skeptic conservatives have been in power for a year , has declined to fix a timetable , simply saying that it aims to hold a referendum in 2010 on whether to give up the zloty - even though joining the single currency was one of the planks of the eu membership treaty already approved by polish voters in 2003 .
warsaw points to the example of sweden , which joined the eu in 1995 and decided to keep the krona after a referendum in 2003 . hungary , which faces a plunging public deficit , has pushed its euro-zone target back to 2013 , while the czech republic is planning to join in 2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu accepts slovenia , rejects lithuania as euro zone member the european commission gave slovenia a green light tuesday to join europe 's single currency next year , but held off on offering approval to lithuania .
-lrb- 16.05.2006 -rrb- germany keeps its midas touch - for now a widening budget deficit continues to haunt berlin .
spending cuts and tax increases are supposed to shrink the horrific shortfalls .
some would like to sell the country ’ s treasured gold reserves to help make ends meet .

upon the expansion of the bloc , the new states in the east have committed themselves to joining the currency union but the path is filled with numerous obstacles .

despite surviving for 26 years , environmental organization greenpeace 's german branch is now experiencing a lack of funding which could make fighting the good fight even harder . the renowned environmental organization greenpeace focuses on the most crucial worldwide threats to the environment .
its high profile and spectacular campaigns have ensured that greenpeace remains the most high profile environmental group on the planet . greenpeace has offices in 40 countries across europe , the americas , asia and the pacific , and established its german branch in hamburg in 1980 .
greenpeace has relied mostly on donations and membership fees to maintain its global reach and its ability to the stage protests anywhere in the world . now , however , the organization has to cut back on expenses .
greenpeace 's german branch , with its annual 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 53 million -rrb- budget in donations , will have to tighten its belt - and cut about three million euros in costs per year . income decreases as expenses rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive publicity stunts are eating into funds managing director brigitte behrens has refuted claims that the current financial situation at greenpeace is a problem of mismanagement .
" no , our donations are stable , " behrens said , " but they 're not increasing at the rate our costs are . " last year alone , the german branch spent hundreds of thousands of euros more than it brought in .
as a result , costs will have to be reduced as of 2008 - and the largest cuts will be in the personnel sector .
works council representative christiane sattler said the 217 employees in hamburg fear for their jobs . " people are n't in a good mood because it 's going to be a tough cut , " sattler said .
" we do n't yet know who will lose their jobs , and what the concept for 2008 will be .
we have n't been given details yet . " management and the works council plan to have worked out a concept by april next year . " there 's been quite a lot of restructuring on an international level over the past two years , and we at greenpeace germany want to more strongly support international campaigns , " brigitte behrens said .
" our branch , for example , is contributing to a new greenpeace ship . " the rainbow warrior ii is expected to cost 15 million euros , and the german branch , said to be the richest , plans to foot about half of that bill . job cuts go against philosophy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace staff are in danger of being cut works council representative sattler agreed that after 26 years , it was time for some changes and readjustment .
" of course we 're proud to be part of an international organization , " she said . " the organization 's international work is especially important ; it 's just that being told to slash jobs is a bit of a contradiction for an organization that was always big on employee participation .

for some , the university is actually the first opportunity to meet other people with disabilities . according to a survey by the german student union , some 15 percent of german students have a disability or are chronically ill .
in addition to attending lectures , making photocopies and taking coffee breaks , students with disabilities also need to deal with a lot of administrative paperwork .
getting appropriate hearing aids , reading devices for the blind or transportation services for wheelchair users often necessitates an elaborate application process . " there is a large number of assistance options that are relatively independent of the kind of handicap , " said dr. maike gattermann-kasper , who advises handicapped and chronically ill students at the university of hamburg and helps them with their paperwork . " many students need special examination conditions .
we advise them and discuss how their special cases can be accommodated .
things do n't depend only on the handicap itself , but also on the requirements in the given subject or course of study , " she said . comparing notes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 15 percent of german students have a disability or are chronically ill there are around 20 deaf and numerous hearing-impaired students at the university of hamburg . some of them had never come into contact with other people with disabilities before coming to college . " only at the university did i actually meet other hearing-impaired students , " said zoe , a hearing-impaired student at the university of hamburg who had previously attended a regular high school . " i actually did n't have any contact with other hearing-impaired people before .
i did n't think that was so bad at the time , but now i think it 's really nice being able to compare notes with others , " she said . overcoming the disability deaf-mute or hearing-impaired students at the university of hamburg have interpreters who translate lectures and seminars into sign language .
additionally , students can request the service of a typist who can compile lecture notes for them or they can use special audio devices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may 2006 , germany passed a broad anti-discrimination law " i use an fm device in my studies , " zoe said .
" fm stands for frequency modulation .
it 's similar to a cell phone .
it has a transmitter , which is like a microphone that emits acoustic signals , or what is being said , to the hearing aid . " even though the system functions well , other students often forget to pass the microphone or the professor forgets to use one .
handicapped students are often reluctant to remind their colleagues or their teachers about the microphones , which sometimes means they can not follow discussions . challenging examinations disabilities are a particular challenge during examinations , even though students are given extensions for their exams or allowed to take them in separate rooms . " i did n't have to take any oral examination until now , " said anna , another hearing-impaired student , who is now preparing for her state examination in special education .
" my first oral will be a part of the state examination , and , in this case , i can ask for a quiet room , for instance . " many students , like anna , say that they are torn between not wanting to be treated as handicapped all the time and , on the other hand , often wishing that those around them were a little more mindful of their situation . " that 's why i like horse-back riding , " anna said .
" when i go riding , my hearing impediment or my disability are not in the foreground .
the main topic is the horse .
and the disability plays no role at all .

despite surviving for 26 years , environmental organization greenpeace 's german branch is now experiencing a lack of funding which could make fighting the good fight even harder . the renowned environmental organization greenpeace focuses on the most crucial worldwide threats to the environment .
its high profile and spectacular campaigns have ensured that greenpeace remains the most high profile environmental group on the planet . greenpeace has offices in 40 countries across europe , the americas , asia and the pacific , and established its german branch in hamburg in 1980 .
greenpeace has relied mostly on donations and membership fees to maintain its global reach and its ability to the stage protests anywhere in the world . now , however , the organization has to cut back on expenses .
greenpeace 's german branch , with its annual 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 53 million -rrb- budget in donations , will have to tighten its belt - and cut about three million euros in costs per year . income decreases as expenses rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive publicity stunts are eating into funds managing director brigitte behrens has refuted claims that the current financial situation at greenpeace is a problem of mismanagement .
" no , our donations are stable , " behrens said , " but they 're not increasing at the rate our costs are . " last year alone , the german branch spent hundreds of thousands of euros more than it brought in .
as a result , costs will have to be reduced as of 2008 - and the largest cuts will be in the personnel sector .
works council representative christiane sattler said the 217 employees in hamburg fear for their jobs . " people are n't in a good mood because it 's going to be a tough cut , " sattler said .
" we do n't yet know who will lose their jobs , and what the concept for 2008 will be .
we have n't been given details yet . " management and the works council plan to have worked out a concept by april next year . " there 's been quite a lot of restructuring on an international level over the past two years , and we at greenpeace germany want to more strongly support international campaigns , " brigitte behrens said .
" our branch , for example , is contributing to a new greenpeace ship . " the rainbow warrior ii is expected to cost 15 million euros , and the german branch , said to be the richest , plans to foot about half of that bill . job cuts go against philosophy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace staff are in danger of being cut works council representative sattler agreed that after 26 years , it was time for some changes and readjustment .
" of course we 're proud to be part of an international organization , " she said . " the organization 's international work is especially important ; it 's just that being told to slash jobs is a bit of a contradiction for an organization that was always big on employee participation .

handicapped students are often reluctant to remind their colleagues or their teachers about the microphones , which sometimes means they can not follow discussions . challenging examinations disabilities are a particular challenge during examinations , even though students are given extensions for their exams or allowed to take them in separate rooms . " i did n't have to take any oral examination until now , " said anna , another hearing-impaired student , who is now preparing for her state examination in special education .
" my first oral will be a part of the state examination , and , in this case , i can ask for a quiet room , for instance .

for some , the university is actually the first opportunity to meet other people with disabilities . according to a survey by the german student union , some 15 percent of german students have a disability or are chronically ill .
in addition to attending lectures , making photocopies and taking coffee breaks , students with disabilities also need to deal with a lot of administrative paperwork .
getting appropriate hearing aids , reading devices for the blind or transportation services for wheelchair users often necessitates an elaborate application process . " there is a large number of assistance options that are relatively independent of the kind of handicap , " said dr. maike gattermann-kasper , who advises handicapped and chronically ill students at the university of hamburg and helps them with their paperwork . " many students need special examination conditions .
we advise them and discuss how their special cases can be accommodated .
things do n't depend only on the handicap itself , but also on the requirements in the given subject or course of study , " she said . comparing notes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 15 percent of german students have a disability or are chronically ill there are around 20 deaf and numerous hearing-impaired students at the university of hamburg . some of them had never come into contact with other people with disabilities before coming to college . " only at the university did i actually meet other hearing-impaired students , " said zoe , a hearing-impaired student at the university of hamburg who had previously attended a regular high school . " i actually did n't have any contact with other hearing-impaired people before .
i did n't think that was so bad at the time , but now i think it 's really nice being able to compare notes with others , " she said . overcoming the disability deaf-mute or hearing-impaired students at the university of hamburg have interpreters who translate lectures and seminars into sign language .
additionally , students can request the service of a typist who can compile lecture notes for them or they can use special audio devices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in may 2006 , germany passed a broad anti-discrimination law " i use an fm device in my studies , " zoe said .
" fm stands for frequency modulation .
it 's similar to a cell phone .
it has a transmitter , which is like a microphone that emits acoustic signals , or what is being said , to the hearing aid . " even though the system functions well , other students often forget to pass the microphone or the professor forgets to use one .
handicapped students are often reluctant to remind their colleagues or their teachers about the microphones , which sometimes means they can not follow discussions . challenging examinations disabilities are a particular challenge during examinations , even though students are given extensions for their exams or allowed to take them in separate rooms . " i did n't have to take any oral examination until now , " said anna , another hearing-impaired student , who is now preparing for her state examination in special education .
" my first oral will be a part of the state examination , and , in this case , i can ask for a quiet room , for instance . " many students , like anna , say that they are torn between not wanting to be treated as handicapped all the time and , on the other hand , often wishing that those around them were a little more mindful of their situation . " that 's why i like horse-back riding , " anna said .
" when i go riding , my hearing impediment or my disability are not in the foreground .
the main topic is the horse .

" we found radiation in the car in which he drove after he arrived in hamburg from russia on october 28 and in a document he signed at the immigration offices , " menzel told reporters . investigators have also found traces of polonium 210 on the couch in kovtun 's ex-wife 's flat where he slept on the night of oct .
30 , menzel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kovtun is reportedly suffering from radiation sickness " tests have shown clearly that we are dealing with polonium 210 , " gerald kirchner from the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- told reporters , referring to the places visited by the businessman during his three-day stay in germany . kovtun is one of three russians who met with kremlin critic litvinenko in london on november 1 , the day on which the former russian spy fell ill .
kovtun has also been hospitalized with severe radioactive poisoning . " he appeared to have been in active contact with polonium .
we are considering him as a suspect also , " hamburg state prosecutor martin koehnke said .
" we have to establish whether he was poisoned himself or carried the polonium into the country , " koehnke said . he said german investigators would share all evidence they uncover with british counterparts probing the murder which friends and family of the victim have blamed squarely on the russian government . litvinenko 's widow blames " hit squad " in her first public interviews since his death on nov .
23 , litvinenko 's widow marina on sunday stood by his death-bed accusation that he was killed by a russian " hit squad " because of his openly critical views of the kremlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german authorities have been investigating in the case of kovtun since friday " obviously , it was not -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin himself , of course not , " the 44-year-old told the mail on sunday .
" but what putin does around him in russia makes it possible to kill a british person on british soil .

" we found radiation in the car in which he drove after he arrived in hamburg from russia on october 28 and in a document he signed at the immigration offices , " menzel told reporters . investigators have also found traces of polonium 210 on the couch in kovtun 's ex-wife 's flat where he slept on the night of oct .
30 , menzel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kovtun is reportedly suffering from radiation sickness " tests have shown clearly that we are dealing with polonium 210 , " gerald kirchner from the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- told reporters , referring to the places visited by the businessman during his three-day stay in germany . kovtun is one of three russians who met with kremlin critic litvinenko in london on november 1 , the day on which the former russian spy fell ill .
kovtun has also been hospitalized with severe radioactive poisoning . " he appeared to have been in active contact with polonium .
we are considering him as a suspect also , " hamburg state prosecutor martin koehnke said .
" we have to establish whether he was poisoned himself or carried the polonium into the country , " koehnke said . he said german investigators would share all evidence they uncover with british counterparts probing the murder which friends and family of the victim have blamed squarely on the russian government . litvinenko 's widow blames " hit squad " in her first public interviews since his death on nov .
23 , litvinenko 's widow marina on sunday stood by his death-bed accusation that he was killed by a russian " hit squad " because of his openly critical views of the kremlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german authorities have been investigating in the case of kovtun since friday " obviously , it was not -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin himself , of course not , " the 44-year-old told the mail on sunday .
" but what putin does around him in russia makes it possible to kill a british person on british soil .
i believe that it could have been the russian authorities . " marina litvinenko told the british press her husband immediately suspected he had been poisoned when he first fell ill on nov .

read the 10 december interview transcript here ...
the economic growth of recent years means our country is richer than ever .
many would have expected poverty to have been defeated as our nation became wealthier .
unfortunately this has not happened .
" breakdown britain " , the interim report of the conservative party 's social justice policy group , shows that in spite of all the government 's spending , relative poverty is getting worse , not better .
this is manifested in appalling rates of family breakdown , educational failure , welfare dependency , drug and alcohol addiction and indebtedness .
perhaps , unsurprisingly , these five " pathways to poverty " reinforce and entrench each other .
sleeping rough is still a big problem labour trumpets its supposed success of taking 2 million children out of poverty , even though the government 's own statistics show the true figure is a more modest 700,000 .
it is true that vast sums have been spent through tax credits in moving people who are just below the poverty line -lrb- 60 % of median income -rrb- , to just above it .
however the exclusive focus on this one measure of poverty has not been wise .
why ?
forgotten firstly , those in severe poverty have been left even further behind .
the government 's approach is similar to some head teachers worried about exam results whose schools focus on ensuring that those who are borderline for achieving 5 a * - c gcses reach that mark .
meanwhile , those at the bottom are quietly forgotten about .
our report conclusively proves that there are 750,000 more people in severe poverty -lrb- below 40 % of median income -rrb- than a decade ago .
particularly vulnerable groups including the acutely disabled find themselves in this category .
a large section of society is becoming completely detached from the rest of us .
indifference many people suffer multiple deprivations gordon brown 's obsession with this one measure of deprivation also does not take into account the breadth of poverty .
many of the families receiving tax credits that take them over the poverty line are still in desperate circumstances .
what chance do the 350,000 or more children whose parents are addicted to hard drugs have to fulfil their potential ?
for most people , material poverty is a consequence of other factors - including family breakdown , drug and alcohol addiction , unemployment and poor education .
the presence of entrenched deprivation often reflects the absence of the supporting structures and constructive relationships that help people stand on their own feet .
labour appears indifferent to the need to strengthen these relationships .
there is a direct , causal link between the strength and health of a child 's family and that child 's prospects in life .
yet government does not have courage to address the centrality of family breakdown in causing and sustaining poverty .
second chance ...
everyone who needs it should get a second chance in life .
getting that second chance could mean life , not death for example those fighting addiction to heroin should have the opportunity to get clean rather than being put on methadone and left to rot .
government has a vital role to play in protecting the most vulnerable , but it is often voluntary and community groups that are best equipped to help people overcome addictions , get back into work or enable families to develop the relationship skills to stay together .
poverty can only be defeated if government works more effectively with the voluntary sector and the public in addressing its root causes .

read the 10 december interview transcript here ...
the economic growth of recent years means our country is richer than ever .
many would have expected poverty to have been defeated as our nation became wealthier .
unfortunately this has not happened .
" breakdown britain " , the interim report of the conservative party 's social justice policy group , shows that in spite of all the government 's spending , relative poverty is getting worse , not better .
this is manifested in appalling rates of family breakdown , educational failure , welfare dependency , drug and alcohol addiction and indebtedness .
perhaps , unsurprisingly , these five " pathways to poverty " reinforce and entrench each other .
sleeping rough is still a big problem labour trumpets its supposed success of taking 2 million children out of poverty , even though the government 's own statistics show the true figure is a more modest 700,000 .
it is true that vast sums have been spent through tax credits in moving people who are just below the poverty line -lrb- 60 % of median income -rrb- , to just above it .
however the exclusive focus on this one measure of poverty has not been wise .
why ?
forgotten firstly , those in severe poverty have been left even further behind .
the government 's approach is similar to some head teachers worried about exam results whose schools focus on ensuring that those who are borderline for achieving 5 a * - c gcses reach that mark .
meanwhile , those at the bottom are quietly forgotten about .
our report conclusively proves that there are 750,000 more people in severe poverty -lrb- below 40 % of median income -rrb- than a decade ago .
particularly vulnerable groups including the acutely disabled find themselves in this category .
a large section of society is becoming completely detached from the rest of us .
indifference many people suffer multiple deprivations gordon brown 's obsession with this one measure of deprivation also does not take into account the breadth of poverty .
many of the families receiving tax credits that take them over the poverty line are still in desperate circumstances .
what chance do the 350,000 or more children whose parents are addicted to hard drugs have to fulfil their potential ?
for most people , material poverty is a consequence of other factors - including family breakdown , drug and alcohol addiction , unemployment and poor education .
the presence of entrenched deprivation often reflects the absence of the supporting structures and constructive relationships that help people stand on their own feet .
labour appears indifferent to the need to strengthen these relationships .
there is a direct , causal link between the strength and health of a child 's family and that child 's prospects in life .
yet government does not have courage to address the centrality of family breakdown in causing and sustaining poverty .
second chance ...
everyone who needs it should get a second chance in life .
getting that second chance could mean life , not death for example those fighting addiction to heroin should have the opportunity to get clean rather than being put on methadone and left to rot .
government has a vital role to play in protecting the most vulnerable , but it is often voluntary and community groups that are best equipped to help people overcome addictions , get back into work or enable families to develop the relationship skills to stay together .
poverty can only be defeated if government works more effectively with the voluntary sector and the public in addressing its root causes .

more than 400 people , along with local mps and ams , took part in the " keeping the flame alive " event in builth wells on saturday .
an action group has been set up to fight plans by powys local health board -lrb- lhb -rrb- as it faces a £ 3.5m deficit .
the lhb has said buildings are outdated and patients deserved better .
the board has proposed cuts at llanidloes , knighton , bronllys and builth wells .
last month nearly 500 people attended a public meeting in the town .
but builth against closing hospitals -lrb- bach -rrb- action group has said the cuts would lead to the hospital 's closure .
the action group has been set up to fight local health board plans bach 's chairman jonathan morgan said : " our hospital is 109 years old and there 's a real sense in the community that it means something to people .
" there 's certainly a lot of strong feelings towards it and that 's why we 've called the service keeping the flame alive . "
the action group has started a fighting fund to save the hospital as well and it has also begun a petition .
in october , up to 1,000 people formed a human ring in the " hands around llanidloes hospital " demonstration .
in september , about 800 people turned out at a meeting in the town in a show of concern .
at llanidloes , the lhb plans to cut 18 beds , close an x-ray unit , a birthing centre and outpatient services .
bronllys , near brecon , and knighton could lose gp beds and maternity services , while 12 gp beds , outpatient and x-ray services could be cut at builth wells .

the home secretary told gmtv 's sunday show the terrorist threat facing the uk was " very high indeed " although he did not think an attack was inevitable .
" we know the number of conspiracies of a major type are in the tens - 30 or round about that , " he said .
the uk threat assessment posted on the home office and mi5 websites is " severe " - the second highest level .
mr reid warned that " the terrorists only have to get through once , as they did on 7 july , for us to see the terrible carnage that it causes .
" our security services have to be successful on every occasion to prevent that happening . "
' generation 's struggle ' the battle against terror would continue for " longer than a generation , " mr reid said .
" when it came to the struggle against republican terrorism in ireland and in the mainland here , that lasted 30 years .
" there is no indication to me that this is going to be resolved any quicker than that . "

" i try to walk the tightrope between being truthful and honest about the threat to the public but , on the other hand , to say we are doing everything possible to combat it and to try to keep our lifestyle as near as possible to the british way of life . "

" it is n't - it 's between the terrorists and everyone else and only with that unity can we ultimately defeat them . "
mr reid said it was important to resolve the israeli-palestinian issue because it " fuels international terrorism " .
he also praised the role of the security services in protecting britain against terror attacks .
" we ought to be very grateful to the people in the security services who work night and day to try to protect us .

the home secretary told gmtv 's sunday show the terrorist threat facing the uk was " very high indeed " although he did not think an attack was inevitable .
" we know the number of conspiracies of a major type are in the tens - 30 or round about that , " he said .
the uk threat assessment posted on the home office and mi5 websites is " severe " - the second highest level .
mr reid warned that " the terrorists only have to get through once , as they did on 7 july , for us to see the terrible carnage that it causes .
" our security services have to be successful on every occasion to prevent that happening . "
' generation 's struggle ' the battle against terror would continue for " longer than a generation , " mr reid said .
" when it came to the struggle against republican terrorism in ireland and in the mainland here , that lasted 30 years .
" there is no indication to me that this is going to be resolved any quicker than that . "
the aim of the terrorists is to divide the community , to pretend that this is a war between muslims and everyone else , when it is n't mr reid also described the difficulties in keeping the public informed of potential terror threats .
" i try to walk the tightrope between being truthful and honest about the threat to the public but , on the other hand , to say we are doing everything possible to combat it and to try to keep our lifestyle as near as possible to the british way of life . "
he added that the uk had to be united against terrorism .
' unity ' " the aim of the terrorists is to divide the community , to pretend that this is a war between muslims and everyone else , when it is n't .
" in a funny way they reflect the views of the extreme right of politics who argue the same thing - that the big division is between islam and everyone else .
" it is n't - it 's between the terrorists and everyone else and only with that unity can we ultimately defeat them . "
mr reid said it was important to resolve the israeli-palestinian issue because it " fuels international terrorism " .
he also praised the role of the security services in protecting britain against terror attacks .
" we ought to be very grateful to the people in the security services who work night and day to try to protect us .
" we can never guarantee that we will get 100 % success but we do get 100 % effort from the security services . "

the 1m -lrb- 3.2ft -rrb- frozen block is being chipped and scraped by artist christine roberts at plas newydd , on anglesey , over the weekend .
the national trust property is home to a famous wall mural by whistler .
the ice is being brought in especially from london for the event - as ice for sculpture has to be frozen slowly to ensure it is strong enough .
artist christine roberts usually works in a false stone material called jesmonite , but said she became interested in ice and snow sculpture 15 years ago after being invited to take part in an ice sculpture competition in finland .
the first attempt by the four-strong team was " a horrible thing " she said , and was a " learning curve " .
" it 's a chance to work on a very large scale , which you ca n't do normally because it is too expensive , " she said .
" it does n't matter that they disappear as it is the making of a piece which is the important part . "
ms roberts is used to working on larger scale ice sculptures the ice sculpture on anglesey will be of a head based on the rex whistler mural at plas newydd .
the block is 1m -lrb- 3.3ft -rrb- high and 25cm -lrb- 10ins -rrb- deep , and ms roberts has produced a 25cm -lrb- 10ins -rrb- scale model to make sure the end result is a success .
the ice sculpture is part of a series of evening events at plas newydd on 9 , 10 , 16 and 17 december .
ms roberts ' previous work includes the synthetic gorsedd stones for the national eisteddfod , produced to cut down on costs .
they are transported around different locations in wales for the annual ceremony saving the cost of buying real stones .

no government has done more than this one to utilise the resources and expertise of the voluntary sector jim murphy , minister for welfare reform read the view of iain duncan smith , the former conservative leader , here ...
britain has become stronger and fairer under labour over the last 10 years - we have moved on from the days of deprivation , crumbling public services and economic uncertainty which held people back under successive conservative governments .
the legacy of poverty we inherited in 1997 was appalling .
child poverty had more than doubled over the previous 18 years and britain had the worst child poverty rate in europe .
one in five families had no-one in work and one in three children were growing up in poverty .
in the first term of this labour government , tony blair set an historic target to eradicate child poverty by 2020 , a target to which the tories still refuse to sign up to .
labour claim that fewer people experience severe poverty now compared to 1997 , there are now 700,000 fewer children and a million fewer pensioners in relative poverty .
commitment to families there are 2.5 million more people in work and families are on average £ 1,500 better off since the labour government came to power , with poorest families £ 3,400 better off .
the progress we have made so far is not accidental .
it has been the result of our commitment to invest in support for families and new measures to make work pay- tax credits , the national minimum wage and the new deal .
those changes have brought real improvements to people 's lives , but have been consistently opposed by the conservatives .
far from learning the lessons of their failures in the 80s and 90s that devastated hardworking families , the tories under david cameron seem determined to repeat them .
a destination for fewer people under labour ?
warm words about social justice are worse than meaningless when they are committed to billions of pounds worth of cuts in support for families , which will lead to substantially more children growing up in poverty .
the third sector no government has done more than this one to utilise the expertise of the voluntary sector and we are determined to break down the barriers that charities can sometimes experience when working with government .
to champion that cause across government we have established the office of the third sector .
in my department , we are currently taking the welfare reform bill through parliament , which will enable a greater role for private and voluntary sector organisations dedicated to helping people off benefit dependency and back to work .
of course we can do more to eradicate poverty and establish an ever closer partnership with the voluntary sector .
however the tory approach set out by iain duncan smith would cut off the opportunity for partnership by cutting public investment in the fight against deprivation and abdicating the government 's responsibility to help people lift themselves out of poverty .
could barriers be broken down between charities and government other than these cuts they have no policies .
today 's tories are like a well wrapped present packaged in whatever colour , size , and way you wish .
pleasant to look at , tempting to open .
but when the little ribbon and the various layers of attractive wrapping are torn away there 's just an empty box .
no content , no substance just an empty nothingness .
this christmas be wary of politicians bearing little but wrapping paper .

in my department , we are currently taking the welfare reform bill through parliament , which will enable a greater role for private and voluntary sector organisations dedicated to helping people off benefit dependency and back to work .
of course we can do more to eradicate poverty and establish an ever closer partnership with the voluntary sector .
however the tory approach set out by iain duncan smith would cut off the opportunity for partnership by cutting public investment in the fight against deprivation and abdicating the government 's responsibility to help people lift themselves out of poverty .
could barriers be broken down between charities and government other than these cuts they have no policies .
today 's tories are like a well wrapped present packaged in whatever colour , size , and way you wish .
pleasant to look at , tempting to open .
but when the little ribbon and the various layers of attractive wrapping are torn away there 's just an empty box .
no content , no substance just an empty nothingness .
this christmas be wary of politicians bearing little but wrapping paper .

john reid told gmtv he planned a system of approved software so parents could feel assured their child was safe from paedophiles while online .
he said the idea was to have a system which alerts parents if trigger phrases were used while their child was online .
more details of the measures , which he called " a major step forward " , would be unveiled on wednesday , he said .
" protecting children is probably the biggest obligation of a civilised society , " he told gmtv 's sunday programme .
ingratiate " we are setting up a task group with the industry to protect kids from what has become one of the greatest threats of abuse , which is the world wide web , the internet .
" mums and dads who are getting familiar with the internet know the dangers to their kids .
" what they do n't know is which of the systems of software which are available to them will actually protect their children .
" we are working with service providers and the industry to get a standard kite mark so that parents will know when buying a system that it will do what it says on the box , that it will protect kids from approaches made via the internet and the potential abuse from that contact . "
mr reid also said he was still considering whether or not to give out more information about the whereabouts of known paedophiles , and in particularly whether the information could be given to at-risk groups .
these might include , for instance " young mothers or single parents who may be prey to paedophiles whose aim is to court them and ingratiate themselves with them " .
it " wo n't be too long " before the government 's proposed new measures were announced , he added .

penrhiw chapel was originally located in dre-fach felindre , carmarthenshire , and was first used as a place of worship in 1777 .
although now an exhibit at the museum , it is still used for services .
welsh unitarians from west wales and cardiff are holding a special anniversary service on sunday .
the building was originally used as a barn but was acquired by the non-conformist unitarians to use as a meeting house .
its capacity was later increased by the creation of a gallery in place of the upper floor .
dismantled gerallt nash , senior curator at st fagans , said : " penrhiw chapel is a good example of an early nonconformist meeting house , where an earlier building - possibly a barn - was turned into a chapel for the unitarians .
" its architecture is simple , unpretentious yet effective , and is characteristic of early welsh chapels with an earth floor and plain wooden pews .
" the size and design of the box pews on the bottom floor vary as they were built for different families , each of whom commissioned its own pew . "
the building was dismantled in 1953 , and was re-erected and opened to the public in st fagans three years later .
reverend eric jones , who is leading sunday 's service , said : " penrhiw chapel was a focal point at dre-fach felindre and it continues to be a central attraction to visitors to st fagans .

the animal charity said a survey found that 70 % of rescued rabbits had been kept hutched 24 hours a day .
almost 40 % had had no food , and half had been living in filthy conditions , it told the bbc .
it found that people bought rabbits but then quickly lost interest .
on average the abandoned pets it came across had been dumped after just three months .
many were simply released in the street or into the wild .
responsibility rabbits are the third most popular pet after cats and dogs and the rspca says that rescue centres are struggling to cope with the 35,000 unwanted pets abandoned every year .
if you did n't have the children , would you be keen to have the rabbit ?
anne mitchell , rabbit welfare association send us your comments anne mitchell from the rabbit welfare association warned that parents needed to realise the responsibilities that go with caring for rabbits .
the animals can live for up to eight years and cost £ 4,000 over their lifetime .
" if you did n't have the children , would you be keen to have the rabbit ?
if you would n't , do n't do it , " she said .
" ninety percent of children get bored , they 're tired very quickly of the chores .
" you ca n't treat it like barbie doll and action man and just stuff it in the cupboard under the stairs , although sadly some of these rabbits do end up like that , totally neglected . "
the rspca statistics will be released next week as part of a survey into rabbit welfare .
here are some of your comments : i think the estimate of £ 4k to keep a rabbit is a little on the high side .
like with any pet , you should always make sure you have a contingency fund for treating any unforeseen illness , but pellets , hay , treats and veg for my house bunny cost no more than £ 20 per month .
it 's a shame to think of people deciding against rescuing a rabbit because of the expense .
i 'm sure most spend twice that on their mobile phone bills !
shona , glasgow about 15 years ago my neighbours were moving and had a rabbit which had lost most of it 's hair due to alopecia they tried to persuade me to have the rabbit so i rang my sister who had young children she gave a home to the rabbit and after a couple of visits to the vet all it 's hair came back and it lived several years happily until it was killed by a fox -lrb- in fulham of all places -rrb- charlie mortimer , london , uk my family has had three rabbits over the years , and the latest one is a rescue .
she was obviously abused , because even after 6 years , she still bites and growls and lunges at us on occasion and is very difficult to pick up for a cuddle .
however , she can also be incredibly sweet , and once she is picked up , nuzzles and snuggles like any of our other rabbits did .
she is inquisitive and incredibly bright for a rabbit , and has often been known to play games with us .
yet she was abused , or at least neglected -lrb- which is of course just a form of abuse -rrb- .
taking care of rabbits is n't that difficult .
it requires dedication and work , just as owning any other animal does .
people need to be sure they have 8-15 years to dedicate to caring for a rabbit before they buy one - they are much longer lived than most realize .
amanda , norwich , uk i discovered not only a guinea pig and a lop eared rabbit what must have been hours after being dumped in the middle of a heavily forested suburb .
the hutch and feeding and drinking bowls were there including a pile of sawdust , the guinea pig i caught and knew of someone who would care for it alongside other pets their very responsible children had .
the rabbit was afraid and ran off into the woods only to be discovered dead where it had been left , it had obviously gone back to its pal and the home it had known , it is so wrong to think by releasing domestic pets into a wild environment would be a kind thing to do , they would be lucky to last the first night .
duncan quick , york , north yorkshire .
many problems these days seem to be children thinking a rabbit is cute and fluffy and small , but they grow and require lots of attention , time and money -lrb- much like the children do ! -rrb- which kids these days can not deal with .
whilst rabbits are small and cute , they are n't cheap .
home visits should be carried out to ensure rabbits are kept in a suitable environment , much like with cats and dogs .
my sisters have not found caring for their rabbits to be a burden because of the joy that they bring , and it disgusts me to think that so many parents have such a flippant attitude towards their actions .
gemma , sheffield , uk rabbits are great pets , if you are prepared to care for them .
i have 2 rescue rabbits and everyone acknowledges they are mine and not the children 's .
the care involved is huge , as much as owning a large dog. they need daily hygiene , a minimum of 2 hours of exercise , play and entertainment , some need daily grooming and all rabbits need a varied diet including mixed fresh vegetables .
i have advised many friends that have asked about rabbit ownership to consider the amount of care involved before making any purchases , and i try to ensure they understand how many bunnies need rehoming before they look at the cute bundles of fluff in a pet shop .
sharron , chandlers ford , hampshire i have two rabbits and they are perfectly healthy .
you just have to see that they are living breathing animals that need your love and care .
you ca n't just say " i 'm not going to clean their hutch or let them out because i do n't feel like it . "
anonymous , can someone explain what gives a human being the right to turn wild animals into pets ?
and what exactly does keeping a pet teach a child ?
how about observing animals free and in their natural habitat instead ?
of course patient observing of nature requires more effort , more involvement , and more knowledge , from the parents .
it teaches a child -lrb- and her parents ! -rrb- how to observe , it encourages her to be inquisitive and to try to interpret and question what she observes .
it also teaches respect for animals and nature , and readily leads to other worthwhile activities or hobbies .
much healthier for everyone than keeping a pet in a cage i think .
any thought anyone ?
pascal , london i rescued my pet rabbit , she 'd had been locked in a cage 24/7 ..
she now has a happy life here with us , she lives in the house with us & makes a great little pet ..
how can people be so cruel ?
if you have a rabbit make sure the hutch is big enough & please please make sure they have a decent size run .. karen mills , wrexham i cant understand some people .
how hard is it to look after a rabbit ? we decided to get my son a rabbit and we got a northumberland dwarf as they do n't grow very big , a little tip for people with a medium sized cage , also we got a male as they are they are the less aggressive type , and he 's gorgeous. we keep him in a hutch and he is fed twice a day , twice a week he has a treat of fresh veg , when weather is not too bad we just let him run about for an hour and he loves and springs about , we recently had his nails clipped and the vet said he was very healthy , he now comes to you when you feed him and nuzzles your hand , and do you know what i find it ten times easier looking after our rabbit than keeping up with all the housework , so come on people , no excuses ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! julie , sheffield we took a rabbit from one of the national pet shop chains as he looked in poor condition and cowering in a corner .
our rabbit is still very timid , over 2 years on and he has had some severe health problems which means he can not live outside , he lives in our house now and has the free run of the house , in essence , he 's a house bunny .
if you are going to get a rabbit , ensure that you can look after them , they need food , water , fruit and veg every day , plus hay .
they need grooming , neutering and plenty of exercise and attention .
we adore our rabbit and he gives us so much pleasure but they do require a lot of love , care and attention .
rabbits give so much back but if you ca n't afford to give them the time they deserve , please do n't buy one and please do n't buy one as a christmas present .
iona pippen , caerphilly i have 3 rabbits .
to give them up or to abandon them is just not a option .
it is hard work looking after the hutches in winter but i still get out there when its cold and clean them and feed them .
in the summer i trim there nails and let them out for runs .
they are the nicest creatures ever .
a message for all readers , " do n't abandon them always ring the rspca and get them taken away with dignity " .
yasmine , rotherham animal cruelty still shocks me every time i hear it .
i myself have 2 rabbits , 2 guinea pigs & 2 hamsters and i love them all so much .
i was surprised of how much hard work looking after a rabbit it .
there about the same hard work as a dog. all animals need excersise and a good diet and love and attention of course. but rabbits have a very sensitive stomach , need at least 2 hours of love & and affection a day and of course need to be let out of there cage for a few hours at least !
the punishment for animal cruelty should be firmer. not just a slap on the hand ! katie hamlet , aberystwyth , wales yes , i 've rescued a rabbit and i 'm waiting to rescue my next one .
it 's terrible to read what 's happening as rabbits make fantastic pets .
all you need is a bit of space and then watch them run , jump and play .
they are so funny to watch but sticking them in a teeny weeny hutch does n't let children -lrb- and adults -rrb- see their full potential .
they 're more playful than adult cats for example .
if you want a rabbit get the biggest hutch you can and a large run and get in there with them - you 're kids will be soon like my 3 year old son - ca n't get enough !
sarah miles , worcestershire we found a rabbit in the gutter five years ago .
nobody claimed her so we kept her but she has cost a considerable amount of money in vet bills over that time .
as much as we like her , a rabbit would not be first on our list of pets .
to throw a rabbit into a hutch and think that that 's all the life it needs is just wrong and cruel , they need a lot more mental stimulation than that .
as for them being a good children 's pet , that 's a myth , children will grow bored of them quickly , and rabbits are more fragile than people believe , serious back injury not being uncommon if they fall or jump the wrong way .
they should not be a disposable commodity in this disposable society .
carol brown , adelaide australia we 've had rabbits in my family for years and we always get them for rspca rescue centres .
it 's beyond me why anyone would pay for one at a pet shop when there are so many who needs homes and might be put down if they do n't find one .
to buy a pet without realising what 's involved and that you might get bored of it is sheer idiocy .
get a rabbit because you have compassion towards animals and rabbits and want it to be part of your family .
do n't get it if you really ca n't be bothered to pay for it , clean its hutch or let it run around for a few hours a day .
it just causes suffering .
andrew , nottingham , uk as a vet with a large primary and referral caseload in rabbits i see this every day .
people get bored of the rabbits very quickly , and have n't researched the costs and keeping of their animals at all .
it 's sickening to think i only see the ones who are honourable enough to bring their animal to us and admit their failure .
if a rabbit is healthy we do what we can to rehome it but it 's a losing battle .
i regularly see rabbits living to 10 years old , some to 12 , and those are the lucky ones .
the second commonest cruelty cases i consult for the rspca are abandoned rabbits , and we investigate those thoroughly - those we catch are prosecuted .
it is heartbreaking to see animals just dumped in the middle of a park with no food or water simply because ignorant people got tired of taking care of them .
with housing facilities at breaking point we have to be ruthless about those we keep , and those we have to euthanase .
it 's disgraceful we 're put in that position by those who take on what they can not care for .
the estimate of costs for keeping a rabbit in the article is about right .
the other problem is people not feeding their rabbits properly .
hay .

william easson , cardiff , wales i was given a rabbit about 6 years ago as a gift .
to be honest in the first week i was n't sure if i wanted him as i knew nothing about rabbits and i was bit nervous if he would bite me and from the way he would sprint around the room so fast i just got put off and at night would put him back in the hutch .
six years later i still have him and would never give him away as he is so intelligent , fun and affectionate and crafty i sometimes forget his a rabbit from the way he behaves .
he is litter trained and when he knows i have been into the kitchen he comes sprinting towards me as he knows his getting a treat .
the bottom line is although rabbits are not like other animals and do n't really make noise they are very sociable animals and the more time you spend with them the end results are amazing .
just because they are quiet and not like a puppy or kitten that does n't mean people should abuse them in anyway as they are also very delicate animals .
i love my bunny so much i let him i sleep in a massive indoor cage that i purchased that has ramps and toys for him .
rabbits get very stressed easily and it is not right to keep them locked in their hutch for too long .
i strongly feel that people should not be allowed to purchase rabbits or any animal for that fact if they are going to think of it as a short term interest .
rabbits are hard work as i know how many times i clean his cage and feed him because its not humane to let them stay in a dirty cage .
jay jay has been a really nice experience for me that six years ago i would have laughed but if you give it a chance and spend time with your rabbit the rewards you get back are priceless .
liza fortes , sudbury uk i have 8 rabbits , 4 of which are rescues .
one was found running around our road and nobody ever claimed him .
i have had him for 4 years now .
even though i handle him every day and he has been castrated he is still aggressive and i doubt he will ever get over anything that happened to him before he came to me .
another was used to breed baby rabbits to be used as food for snakes .
she was pregnant when she came to me .
she killed all the babies .
think of the animal and not your children .
they do n't need a rabbit .
it wo n't teach them responsibility .
maybe if people stopped buying them the demand would n't be there and people would n't be irresponsibly breeding them .
break that circle. em , bristol , uk i got my two rabbits from greenwich rabbit rescue .
both were 3 month old minilops , from different homes .
after some unsettled and anxious behaviour like peeing on my lap , running away from pointing fingers or nipping and keeping jaws open , they are now almost docile .
they pretty much have the run of the house , and when it 's not too cold , run around the garden for a few hours .
there is daily hutch cleaning and feeding , but otherwise , they are happy to lounge and hop about .
i have no kids , so maybe that helps. martha rumian , london uk i have taken in 2 rabbits over the years which were unwanted pets .
i have also taken in budgies , hamsters , and a dog which were all unwanted .
it really annoys me that people do n't think long term about pets and are quick to dismiss them .
bring back licences - as anyone prepared to buy a licence will be prepared to look after a pet long term .
it is something that should be taught in school - the cost and effort that goes into owning a pet -lrb- babies as well -rrb- .
i only support animal charities , and being so soft over animals , people will always come to me first with any unwanted pets - and i ca n't say no .
my local paper often advertises pieces on animal care - could this be done nationally ?
paula flinders , nottinghamshire i found our rabbit in our garden on 4 jan 04 .
i had seen her around the neighbourhood , under parked cars and running through the bushes .
i caught her and brought her into our home .
this is where she stayed for nearly 2 years , as my house rabbit .
she was very easy to train , she had a hutch in the utility room which was always open , there was a litter tray next to the hutch .
the back door to the garden was always open so she could hop in and out when she felt like it and when the weather was fine , she even used to hop back in to use the litter tray .
i have three children from 18 down to 12 and they adored her but she was my rabbit when it came to feeding , cleaning and clipping nails .
they just gave her a name ; fubu .
i had to have her put down last christmas as she had arthritis in her back legs due to the bad diet and care she used to suffer from .
this was heartbreaking to watch in such a friendly animal but this is what happens when people do n't care enough about their pets . !
ellen plowman , chippenham wilts i " adopted " a rabbit nobody else wanted when i was a child .
i 'm now 51 .
i still remember him along with the cats and dogs i 've had since then .
i remember the love i felt for him , the unconsolable sadness i felt when he died .
the feelings generated by loving and caring for my pets and the responsibility involved are things that i 've tried to pass on to my children .
i 'm absolutely sure this has made us better people .
i now have three abandoned cats and an abandoned dog .
abandoning pets says something about who we are and the society we 've all " helped " to create .
none of us should ignore this fact .
liz brindley , baiona , spain rabbits are social animals and so need company .
if you are going to keep a rabbit outdoors in a hutch they should be kept in neutered / spayed pairs for company .
the best combination is a male and a female .
if kept on their own rabbits can become very depressed .
a hutch should be large enough for the rabbits to stand up on their back legs and have a permanently attached run for exercise .
if you are going to keep rabbits with enough attention to their welfare then please bear in mind that they are not cheap pets .
the initial set up costs for a pair of rabbits with a suitable hutch , vaccinations , neutering / spaying and food is around £ 600 .
if you are n't prepared to spend this sort of money then you really should n't buy them because to not provide all they need is cruel .
having said all that rabbits make excellent pets , we have two which actually live in the house and give us many hours of pleasure .
in case you are wondering they are very clean and are easily litter trained !
richard thacker , bristol i recently took on a rabbit that someone no longer wanted .
he was kept in a tiny hutch 24 hours a day and rarely had any water or adequate food .
he now has a 7ft enclosure and run of the garden when we are home .
i have bonded him with my female and they are totally happy .
rabbits are not kids pets .
they can be feisty , hard to hold when fully grown and territorial when not neutered .
only get a rabbit if an adult will ultimately be responsible for it .
kids can not be expected to take sole responsibility for one .
rabbits should not be kept alone , or with a guinea pig .
they should be neutered , vaccinated , have time spent with them , get regular daily exercise , a good diet including a supply of hay constantly , the list is endless .
please , please , do not buy a rabbit on a whim without giving it a lot of thought .
please also do not buy from a pet shop when there are so many animals in rescue .
kate , birmingham , west midlands in 1997 we found a french lop rabbit that had been dumped and she was most probably was an unwanted easter bunny that was bought for a kid who grew bored of her .
many parents sadly give in to temptation and buy rabbits as pets for their kids on the spare of the moment no thought in their future care etc , not meaning to be cruel but the children just lose interest after a while and therefore the poor bunny suffers , locked up in its cage or even has no food or water .
many cages are way to small that they sell in pet shops and the poor bunnies who once fitted in them as babies and then soon row soon outgrow their enclosures and therefore have no room to move .
thumper was lucky we rescued her and lived a very long and happy life estimated to be between 9-13 years old , many parents need to be aware of the costs rabbits can occur in their lifetime which can be 7years or more ! and also they need to be aware that they need vaccinating against deadly diseases such as vhd and myximotosis. lisa yates , manchester i am only 14 we 've had 1 rabbit loads of hamsters and 3 guinea pigs our guinea pigs have out lasted all the hamsters and 1 of our dogs .
they live a longer healthier life if you let them outside in summer and inside for a run about in winter they also receive fresh fruit and veg at night and are know over 12 years old zoe handley -lrb- 14 -rrb- , derby uk last week i saved two lionhead rabbits 1 girl and 1 boy they were about 3 month old , which were housed in a small bird cage , they were living in filthy conditions they had no food or clean water .
thy female rabbit was really skinny and had large amounts of matted fur around her rear end , it took 45 mins to cut it away. they are now both happy and healthy rabbits. i already have 4 rabbits of my own , and they are in healthy condition , they are let out of their hutches everyday from 7.00am-8.30-9.00pm -lrb- into a 16foot log cabin , with mesh windows -rrb- and are cleaned twice a week , they are also provided with fresh greens everyday , i also have live with two lovely rottweiller who play and clean the rabbits. i think that if people are thinking of owing rabbits they should do some research before hand , because its not as easy as it looks. victoria , bedfordshire e-mail this to a friend printable version video and audio news rabbits need a lot of social stimulation see also animal cases shock rspca officers 10 nov 06 -pipe- cornwall family rabbits stabbed to death 19 sep 06 -pipe- north east / n isles poorly rabbits dumped on roadside 22 aug 06 -pipe- coventry / warwickshire rspca criticises ' rabbit wedding ' 04 apr 06 -pipe- hereford / worcs crisis as pets breed like rabbits 20 feb 06 -pipe- lincolnshire related bbc links your pet rabbit related internet links rabbit welfare association rspca the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top uk stories major manhunt for afghan soldier unemployment dips to 2.47 million pm condemns sympathy for moat most popular stories now most shared most read taliban targets : women , children , foreigners iraqi asylum seekers struggle to survive in sweden most popular now , in detail most shared most read spectators killed at us car race ' jarhead ' bear gets out of a jam taliban targets : women , children , foreigners russia ban on grain export begins in pictures : zurich 's dance parade baseball cup moved after shooting celebrations as princess turns 60 lebanon ' kills militant leader ' four killed in ny state shooting double jeopardy will be scrapped most popular now , in detail features , views , analysis planning an exit attacks by afghan soldiers pose nato problems sanction evasion ?

the animal charity said a survey found that 70 % of rescued rabbits had been kept hutched 24 hours a day .
almost 40 % had had no food , and half had been living in filthy conditions , it told the bbc .
it found that people bought rabbits but then quickly lost interest .
on average the abandoned pets it came across had been dumped after just three months .
many were simply released in the street or into the wild .
responsibility rabbits are the third most popular pet after cats and dogs and the rspca says that rescue centres are struggling to cope with the 35,000 unwanted pets abandoned every year .
if you did n't have the children , would you be keen to have the rabbit ?
anne mitchell , rabbit welfare association send us your comments anne mitchell from the rabbit welfare association warned that parents needed to realise the responsibilities that go with caring for rabbits .
the animals can live for up to eight years and cost £ 4,000 over their lifetime .
" if you did n't have the children , would you be keen to have the rabbit ?
if you would n't , do n't do it , " she said .
" ninety percent of children get bored , they 're tired very quickly of the chores .
" you ca n't treat it like barbie doll and action man and just stuff it in the cupboard under the stairs , although sadly some of these rabbits do end up like that , totally neglected . "
the rspca statistics will be released next week as part of a survey into rabbit welfare .
here are some of your comments : i think the estimate of £ 4k to keep a rabbit is a little on the high side .
like with any pet , you should always make sure you have a contingency fund for treating any unforeseen illness , but pellets , hay , treats and veg for my house bunny cost no more than £ 20 per month .
it 's a shame to think of people deciding against rescuing a rabbit because of the expense .
i 'm sure most spend twice that on their mobile phone bills !
shona , glasgow about 15 years ago my neighbours were moving and had a rabbit which had lost most of it 's hair due to alopecia they tried to persuade me to have the rabbit so i rang my sister who had young children she gave a home to the rabbit and after a couple of visits to the vet all it 's hair came back and it lived several years happily until it was killed by a fox -lrb- in fulham of all places -rrb- charlie mortimer , london , uk my family has had three rabbits over the years , and the latest one is a rescue .
she was obviously abused , because even after 6 years , she still bites and growls and lunges at us on occasion and is very difficult to pick up for a cuddle .
however , she can also be incredibly sweet , and once she is picked up , nuzzles and snuggles like any of our other rabbits did .
she is inquisitive and incredibly bright for a rabbit , and has often been known to play games with us .
yet she was abused , or at least neglected -lrb- which is of course just a form of abuse -rrb- .
taking care of rabbits is n't that difficult .
it requires dedication and work , just as owning any other animal does .
people need to be sure they have 8-15 years to dedicate to caring for a rabbit before they buy one - they are much longer lived than most realize .
amanda , norwich , uk i discovered not only a guinea pig and a lop eared rabbit what must have been hours after being dumped in the middle of a heavily forested suburb .
the hutch and feeding and drinking bowls were there including a pile of sawdust , the guinea pig i caught and knew of someone who would care for it alongside other pets their very responsible children had .
the rabbit was afraid and ran off into the woods only to be discovered dead where it had been left , it had obviously gone back to its pal and the home it had known , it is so wrong to think by releasing domestic pets into a wild environment would be a kind thing to do , they would be lucky to last the first night .
duncan quick , york , north yorkshire .
many problems these days seem to be children thinking a rabbit is cute and fluffy and small , but they grow and require lots of attention , time and money -lrb- much like the children do ! -rrb- which kids these days can not deal with .
whilst rabbits are small and cute , they are n't cheap .
home visits should be carried out to ensure rabbits are kept in a suitable environment , much like with cats and dogs .
my sisters have not found caring for their rabbits to be a burden because of the joy that they bring , and it disgusts me to think that so many parents have such a flippant attitude towards their actions .
gemma , sheffield , uk rabbits are great pets , if you are prepared to care for them .
i have 2 rescue rabbits and everyone acknowledges they are mine and not the children 's .
the care involved is huge , as much as owning a large dog. they need daily hygiene , a minimum of 2 hours of exercise , play and entertainment , some need daily grooming and all rabbits need a varied diet including mixed fresh vegetables .
i have advised many friends that have asked about rabbit ownership to consider the amount of care involved before making any purchases , and i try to ensure they understand how many bunnies need rehoming before they look at the cute bundles of fluff in a pet shop .
sharron , chandlers ford , hampshire i have two rabbits and they are perfectly healthy .
you just have to see that they are living breathing animals that need your love and care .
you ca n't just say " i 'm not going to clean their hutch or let them out because i do n't feel like it . "
anonymous , can someone explain what gives a human being the right to turn wild animals into pets ?
and what exactly does keeping a pet teach a child ?
how about observing animals free and in their natural habitat instead ?
of course patient observing of nature requires more effort , more involvement , and more knowledge , from the parents .
it teaches a child -lrb- and her parents ! -rrb- how to observe , it encourages her to be inquisitive and to try to interpret and question what she observes .
it also teaches respect for animals and nature , and readily leads to other worthwhile activities or hobbies .
much healthier for everyone than keeping a pet in a cage i think .
any thought anyone ?

they pretty much have the run of the house , and when it 's not too cold , run around the garden for a few hours .
there is daily hutch cleaning and feeding , but otherwise , they are happy to lounge and hop about .
i have no kids , so maybe that helps. martha rumian , london uk i have taken in 2 rabbits over the years which were unwanted pets .
i have also taken in budgies , hamsters , and a dog which were all unwanted .
it really annoys me that people do n't think long term about pets and are quick to dismiss them .
bring back licences - as anyone prepared to buy a licence will be prepared to look after a pet long term .
it is something that should be taught in school - the cost and effort that goes into owning a pet -lrb- babies as well -rrb- .
i only support animal charities , and being so soft over animals , people will always come to me first with any unwanted pets - and i ca n't say no .
my local paper often advertises pieces on animal care - could this be done nationally ?
paula flinders , nottinghamshire i found our rabbit in our garden on 4 jan 04 .
i had seen her around the neighbourhood , under parked cars and running through the bushes .
i caught her and brought her into our home .
this is where she stayed for nearly 2 years , as my house rabbit .
she was very easy to train , she had a hutch in the utility room which was always open , there was a litter tray next to the hutch .
the back door to the garden was always open so she could hop in and out when she felt like it and when the weather was fine , she even used to hop back in to use the litter tray .
i have three children from 18 down to 12 and they adored her but she was my rabbit when it came to feeding , cleaning and clipping nails .
they just gave her a name ; fubu .
i had to have her put down last christmas as she had arthritis in her back legs due to the bad diet and care she used to suffer from .
this was heartbreaking to watch in such a friendly animal but this is what happens when people do n't care enough about their pets . !
ellen plowman , chippenham wilts i " adopted " a rabbit nobody else wanted when i was a child .
i 'm now 51 .
i still remember him along with the cats and dogs i 've had since then .
i remember the love i felt for him , the unconsolable sadness i felt when he died .
the feelings generated by loving and caring for my pets and the responsibility involved are things that i 've tried to pass on to my children .
i 'm absolutely sure this has made us better people .
i now have three abandoned cats and an abandoned dog .
abandoning pets says something about who we are and the society we 've all " helped " to create .
none of us should ignore this fact .
liz brindley , baiona , spain rabbits are social animals and so need company .
if you are going to keep a rabbit outdoors in a hutch they should be kept in neutered / spayed pairs for company .
the best combination is a male and a female .
if kept on their own rabbits can become very depressed .
a hutch should be large enough for the rabbits to stand up on their back legs and have a permanently attached run for exercise .
if you are going to keep rabbits with enough attention to their welfare then please bear in mind that they are not cheap pets .
the initial set up costs for a pair of rabbits with a suitable hutch , vaccinations , neutering / spaying and food is around £ 600 .
if you are n't prepared to spend this sort of money then you really should n't buy them because to not provide all they need is cruel .
having said all that rabbits make excellent pets , we have two which actually live in the house and give us many hours of pleasure .
in case you are wondering they are very clean and are easily litter trained !
richard thacker , bristol i recently took on a rabbit that someone no longer wanted .
he was kept in a tiny hutch 24 hours a day and rarely had any water or adequate food .
he now has a 7ft enclosure and run of the garden when we are home .
i have bonded him with my female and they are totally happy .
rabbits are not kids pets .
they can be feisty , hard to hold when fully grown and territorial when not neutered .
only get a rabbit if an adult will ultimately be responsible for it .
kids can not be expected to take sole responsibility for one .
rabbits should not be kept alone , or with a guinea pig .
they should be neutered , vaccinated , have time spent with them , get regular daily exercise , a good diet including a supply of hay constantly , the list is endless .
please , please , do not buy a rabbit on a whim without giving it a lot of thought .
please also do not buy from a pet shop when there are so many animals in rescue .
kate , birmingham , west midlands in 1997 we found a french lop rabbit that had been dumped and she was most probably was an unwanted easter bunny that was bought for a kid who grew bored of her .
many parents sadly give in to temptation and buy rabbits as pets for their kids on the spare of the moment no thought in their future care etc , not meaning to be cruel but the children just lose interest after a while and therefore the poor bunny suffers , locked up in its cage or even has no food or water .
many cages are way to small that they sell in pet shops and the poor bunnies who once fitted in them as babies and then soon row soon outgrow their enclosures and therefore have no room to move .
thumper was lucky we rescued her and lived a very long and happy life estimated to be between 9-13 years old , many parents need to be aware of the costs rabbits can occur in their lifetime which can be 7years or more ! and also they need to be aware that they need vaccinating against deadly diseases such as vhd and myximotosis. lisa yates , manchester i am only 14 we 've had 1 rabbit loads of hamsters and 3 guinea pigs our guinea pigs have out lasted all the hamsters and 1 of our dogs .
they live a longer healthier life if you let them outside in summer and inside for a run about in winter they also receive fresh fruit and veg at night and are know over 12 years old zoe handley -lrb- 14 -rrb- , derby uk last week i saved two lionhead rabbits 1 girl and 1 boy they were about 3 month old , which were housed in a small bird cage , they were living in filthy conditions they had no food or clean water .
thy female rabbit was really skinny and had large amounts of matted fur around her rear end , it took 45 mins to cut it away. they are now both happy and healthy rabbits. i already have 4 rabbits of my own , and they are in healthy condition , they are let out of their hutches everyday from 7.00am-8.30-9.00pm -lrb- into a 16foot log cabin , with mesh windows -rrb- and are cleaned twice a week , they are also provided with fresh greens everyday , i also have live with two lovely rottweiller who play and clean the rabbits. i think that if people are thinking of owing rabbits they should do some research before hand , because its not as easy as it looks. victoria , bedfordshire e-mail this to a friend printable version video and audio news rabbits need a lot of social stimulation see also animal cases shock rspca officers 10 nov 06 -pipe- cornwall family rabbits stabbed to death 19 sep 06 -pipe- north east / n isles poorly rabbits dumped on roadside 22 aug 06 -pipe- coventry / warwickshire rspca criticises ' rabbit wedding ' 04 apr 06 -pipe- hereford / worcs crisis as pets breed like rabbits 20 feb 06 -pipe- lincolnshire related bbc links your pet rabbit related internet links rabbit welfare association rspca the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top uk stories major manhunt for afghan soldier unemployment dips to 2.47 million pm condemns sympathy for moat most popular stories now most shared most read russia country profile philippines country profile most popular now , in detail most shared most read man grows pea plant inside lung relic of ' original earth ' exposed dying girl photographs criticised pakistan flood desperation grows lindsay lohan judge steps aside speedy solution to rubik 's cube ' fake fishermen ' angle for bp pay bin laden chef handed jail term russia ' has missiles ' in abkhazia iraq ' not ready ' for us pull-out most popular now , in detail features , views , analysis planning an exit attacks by afghan soldiers pose nato problems sanction evasion ?

the animal charity said a survey found that 70 % of rescued rabbits had been kept hutched 24 hours a day .
almost 40 % had had no food , and half had been living in filthy conditions , it told the bbc .
it found that people bought rabbits but then quickly lost interest .
on average the abandoned pets it came across had been dumped after just three months .
many were simply released in the street or into the wild .
responsibility rabbits are the third most popular pet after cats and dogs and the rspca says that rescue centres are struggling to cope with the 35,000 unwanted pets abandoned every year .
if you did n't have the children , would you be keen to have the rabbit ?
anne mitchell , rabbit welfare association send us your comments anne mitchell from the rabbit welfare association warned that parents needed to realise the responsibilities that go with caring for rabbits .
the animals can live for up to eight years and cost £ 4,000 over their lifetime .
" if you did n't have the children , would you be keen to have the rabbit ?
if you would n't , do n't do it , " she said .
" ninety percent of children get bored , they 're tired very quickly of the chores .
" you ca n't treat it like barbie doll and action man and just stuff it in the cupboard under the stairs , although sadly some of these rabbits do end up like that , totally neglected . "
the rspca statistics will be released next week as part of a survey into rabbit welfare .
here are some of your comments : i think the estimate of £ 4k to keep a rabbit is a little on the high side .
like with any pet , you should always make sure you have a contingency fund for treating any unforeseen illness , but pellets , hay , treats and veg for my house bunny cost no more than £ 20 per month .
it 's a shame to think of people deciding against rescuing a rabbit because of the expense .
i 'm sure most spend twice that on their mobile phone bills !
shona , glasgow about 15 years ago my neighbours were moving and had a rabbit which had lost most of it 's hair due to alopecia they tried to persuade me to have the rabbit so i rang my sister who had young children she gave a home to the rabbit and after a couple of visits to the vet all it 's hair came back and it lived several years happily until it was killed by a fox -lrb- in fulham of all places -rrb- charlie mortimer , london , uk my family has had three rabbits over the years , and the latest one is a rescue .
she was obviously abused , because even after 6 years , she still bites and growls and lunges at us on occasion and is very difficult to pick up for a cuddle .
however , she can also be incredibly sweet , and once she is picked up , nuzzles and snuggles like any of our other rabbits did .
she is inquisitive and incredibly bright for a rabbit , and has often been known to play games with us .
yet she was abused , or at least neglected -lrb- which is of course just a form of abuse -rrb- .
taking care of rabbits is n't that difficult .
it requires dedication and work , just as owning any other animal does .
people need to be sure they have 8-15 years to dedicate to caring for a rabbit before they buy one - they are much longer lived than most realize .
amanda , norwich , uk i discovered not only a guinea pig and a lop eared rabbit what must have been hours after being dumped in the middle of a heavily forested suburb .
the hutch and feeding and drinking bowls were there including a pile of sawdust , the guinea pig i caught and knew of someone who would care for it alongside other pets their very responsible children had .
the rabbit was afraid and ran off into the woods only to be discovered dead where it had been left , it had obviously gone back to its pal and the home it had known , it is so wrong to think by releasing domestic pets into a wild environment would be a kind thing to do , they would be lucky to last the first night .
duncan quick , york , north yorkshire .
many problems these days seem to be children thinking a rabbit is cute and fluffy and small , but they grow and require lots of attention , time and money -lrb- much like the children do ! -rrb- which kids these days can not deal with .
whilst rabbits are small and cute , they are n't cheap .
home visits should be carried out to ensure rabbits are kept in a suitable environment , much like with cats and dogs .
my sisters have not found caring for their rabbits to be a burden because of the joy that they bring , and it disgusts me to think that so many parents have such a flippant attitude towards their actions .
gemma , sheffield , uk rabbits are great pets , if you are prepared to care for them .
i have 2 rescue rabbits and everyone acknowledges they are mine and not the children 's .
the care involved is huge , as much as owning a large dog. they need daily hygiene , a minimum of 2 hours of exercise , play and entertainment , some need daily grooming and all rabbits need a varied diet including mixed fresh vegetables .
i have advised many friends that have asked about rabbit ownership to consider the amount of care involved before making any purchases , and i try to ensure they understand how many bunnies need rehoming before they look at the cute bundles of fluff in a pet shop .
sharron , chandlers ford , hampshire i have two rabbits and they are perfectly healthy .
you just have to see that they are living breathing animals that need your love and care .
you ca n't just say " i 'm not going to clean their hutch or let them out because i do n't feel like it . "
anonymous , can someone explain what gives a human being the right to turn wild animals into pets ?
and what exactly does keeping a pet teach a child ?
how about observing animals free and in their natural habitat instead ?
of course patient observing of nature requires more effort , more involvement , and more knowledge , from the parents .
it teaches a child -lrb- and her parents ! -rrb- how to observe , it encourages her to be inquisitive and to try to interpret and question what she observes .
it also teaches respect for animals and nature , and readily leads to other worthwhile activities or hobbies .
much healthier for everyone than keeping a pet in a cage i think .
any thought anyone ?
pascal , london i rescued my pet rabbit , she 'd had been locked in a cage 24/7 ..
she now has a happy life here with us , she lives in the house with us & makes a great little pet ..
how can people be so cruel ?
if you have a rabbit make sure the hutch is big enough & please please make sure they have a decent size run .. karen mills , wrexham i cant understand some people .
how hard is it to look after a rabbit ? we decided to get my son a rabbit and we got a northumberland dwarf as they do n't grow very big , a little tip for people with a medium sized cage , also we got a male as they are they are the less aggressive type , and he 's gorgeous. we keep him in a hutch and he is fed twice a day , twice a week he has a treat of fresh veg , when weather is not too bad we just let him run about for an hour and he loves and springs about , we recently had his nails clipped and the vet said he was very healthy , he now comes to you when you feed him and nuzzles your hand , and do you know what i find it ten times easier looking after our rabbit than keeping up with all the housework , so come on people , no excuses ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! julie , sheffield we took a rabbit from one of the national pet shop chains as he looked in poor condition and cowering in a corner .
our rabbit is still very timid , over 2 years on and he has had some severe health problems which means he can not live outside , he lives in our house now and has the free run of the house , in essence , he 's a house bunny .
if you are going to get a rabbit , ensure that you can look after them , they need food , water , fruit and veg every day , plus hay .
they need grooming , neutering and plenty of exercise and attention .
we adore our rabbit and he gives us so much pleasure but they do require a lot of love , care and attention .
rabbits give so much back but if you ca n't afford to give them the time they deserve , please do n't buy one and please do n't buy one as a christmas present .
iona pippen , caerphilly i have 3 rabbits .
to give them up or to abandon them is just not a option .
it is hard work looking after the hutches in winter but i still get out there when its cold and clean them and feed them .
in the summer i trim there nails and let them out for runs .
they are the nicest creatures ever .
a message for all readers , " do n't abandon them always ring the rspca and get them taken away with dignity " .
yasmine , rotherham animal cruelty still shocks me every time i hear it .
i myself have 2 rabbits , 2 guinea pigs & 2 hamsters and i love them all so much .
i was surprised of how much hard work looking after a rabbit it .
there about the same hard work as a dog. all animals need excersise and a good diet and love and attention of course. but rabbits have a very sensitive stomach , need at least 2 hours of love & and affection a day and of course need to be let out of there cage for a few hours at least !
the punishment for animal cruelty should be firmer. not just a slap on the hand ! katie hamlet , aberystwyth , wales yes , i 've rescued a rabbit and i 'm waiting to rescue my next one .
it 's terrible to read what 's happening as rabbits make fantastic pets .
all you need is a bit of space and then watch them run , jump and play .
they are so funny to watch but sticking them in a teeny weeny hutch does n't let children -lrb- and adults -rrb- see their full potential .
they 're more playful than adult cats for example .
if you want a rabbit get the biggest hutch you can and a large run and get in there with them - you 're kids will be soon like my 3 year old son - ca n't get enough !
sarah miles , worcestershire we found a rabbit in the gutter five years ago .
nobody claimed her so we kept her but she has cost a considerable amount of money in vet bills over that time .
as much as we like her , a rabbit would not be first on our list of pets .
to throw a rabbit into a hutch and think that that 's all the life it needs is just wrong and cruel , they need a lot more mental stimulation than that .
as for them being a good children 's pet , that 's a myth , children will grow bored of them quickly , and rabbits are more fragile than people believe , serious back injury not being uncommon if they fall or jump the wrong way .
they should not be a disposable commodity in this disposable society .
carol brown , adelaide australia we 've had rabbits in my family for years and we always get them for rspca rescue centres .
it 's beyond me why anyone would pay for one at a pet shop when there are so many who needs homes and might be put down if they do n't find one .
to buy a pet without realising what 's involved and that you might get bored of it is sheer idiocy .
get a rabbit because you have compassion towards animals and rabbits and want it to be part of your family .
do n't get it if you really ca n't be bothered to pay for it , clean its hutch or let it run around for a few hours a day .
it just causes suffering .
andrew , nottingham , uk as a vet with a large primary and referral caseload in rabbits i see this every day .
people get bored of the rabbits very quickly , and have n't researched the costs and keeping of their animals at all .
it 's sickening to think i only see the ones who are honourable enough to bring their animal to us and admit their failure .
if a rabbit is healthy we do what we can to rehome it but it 's a losing battle .
i regularly see rabbits living to 10 years old , some to 12 , and those are the lucky ones .
the second commonest cruelty cases i consult for the rspca are abandoned rabbits , and we investigate those thoroughly - those we catch are prosecuted .
it is heartbreaking to see animals just dumped in the middle of a park with no food or water simply because ignorant people got tired of taking care of them .
with housing facilities at breaking point we have to be ruthless about those we keep , and those we have to euthanase .
it 's disgraceful we 're put in that position by those who take on what they can not care for .
the estimate of costs for keeping a rabbit in the article is about right .
the other problem is people not feeding their rabbits properly .
hay .
grass .
hay .
grass .
that 's it .
perhaps a supplement if you want to .
" mixes " and so on will just end up in dental disease , and a lifetime of pain and discomfort , and a huge vets ' bill .
think before you buy .
william easson , cardiff , wales i was given a rabbit about 6 years ago as a gift .
to be honest in the first week i was n't sure if i wanted him as i knew nothing about rabbits and i was bit nervous if he would bite me and from the way he would sprint around the room so fast i just got put off and at night would put him back in the hutch .
six years later i still have him and would never give him away as he is so intelligent , fun and affectionate and crafty i sometimes forget his a rabbit from the way he behaves .
he is litter trained and when he knows i have been into the kitchen he comes sprinting towards me as he knows his getting a treat .
the bottom line is although rabbits are not like other animals and do n't really make noise they are very sociable animals and the more time you spend with them the end results are amazing .
just because they are quiet and not like a puppy or kitten that does n't mean people should abuse them in anyway as they are also very delicate animals .
i love my bunny so much i let him i sleep in a massive indoor cage that i purchased that has ramps and toys for him .
rabbits get very stressed easily and it is not right to keep them locked in their hutch for too long .
i strongly feel that people should not be allowed to purchase rabbits or any animal for that fact if they are going to think of it as a short term interest .
rabbits are hard work as i know how many times i clean his cage and feed him because its not humane to let them stay in a dirty cage .
jay jay has been a really nice experience for me that six years ago i would have laughed but if you give it a chance and spend time with your rabbit the rewards you get back are priceless .
liza fortes , sudbury uk i have 8 rabbits , 4 of which are rescues .
one was found running around our road and nobody ever claimed him .
i have had him for 4 years now .
even though i handle him every day and he has been castrated he is still aggressive and i doubt he will ever get over anything that happened to him before he came to me .
another was used to breed baby rabbits to be used as food for snakes .
she was pregnant when she came to me .
she killed all the babies .
think of the animal and not your children .
they do n't need a rabbit .
it wo n't teach them responsibility .
maybe if people stopped buying them the demand would n't be there and people would n't be irresponsibly breeding them .
break that circle. em , bristol , uk i got my two rabbits from greenwich rabbit rescue .
both were 3 month old minilops , from different homes .
after some unsettled and anxious behaviour like peeing on my lap , running away from pointing fingers or nipping and keeping jaws open , they are now almost docile .

the animal charity said a survey found that 70 % of rescued rabbits had been kept hutched 24 hours a day .
almost 40 % had had no food , and half had been living in filthy conditions , it told the bbc .
it found that people bought rabbits but then quickly lost interest .
on average the abandoned pets it came across had been dumped after just three months .
many were simply released in the street or into the wild .
responsibility rabbits are the third most popular pet after cats and dogs and the rspca says that rescue centres are struggling to cope with the 35,000 unwanted pets abandoned every year .
if you did n't have the children , would you be keen to have the rabbit ?
anne mitchell , rabbit welfare association send us your comments anne mitchell from the rabbit welfare association warned that parents needed to realise the responsibilities that go with caring for rabbits .
the animals can live for up to eight years and cost £ 4,000 over their lifetime .
" if you did n't have the children , would you be keen to have the rabbit ?
if you would n't , do n't do it , " she said .
" ninety percent of children get bored , they 're tired very quickly of the chores .
" you ca n't treat it like barbie doll and action man and just stuff it in the cupboard under the stairs , although sadly some of these rabbits do end up like that , totally neglected . "
the rspca statistics will be released next week as part of a survey into rabbit welfare .
here are some of your comments : i think the estimate of £ 4k to keep a rabbit is a little on the high side .
like with any pet , you should always make sure you have a contingency fund for treating any unforeseen illness , but pellets , hay , treats and veg for my house bunny cost no more than £ 20 per month .
it 's a shame to think of people deciding against rescuing a rabbit because of the expense .
i 'm sure most spend twice that on their mobile phone bills !
shona , glasgow about 15 years ago my neighbours were moving and had a rabbit which had lost most of it 's hair due to alopecia they tried to persuade me to have the rabbit so i rang my sister who had young children she gave a home to the rabbit and after a couple of visits to the vet all it 's hair came back and it lived several years happily until it was killed by a fox -lrb- in fulham of all places -rrb- charlie mortimer , london , uk my family has had three rabbits over the years , and the latest one is a rescue .
she was obviously abused , because even after 6 years , she still bites and growls and lunges at us on occasion and is very difficult to pick up for a cuddle .
however , she can also be incredibly sweet , and once she is picked up , nuzzles and snuggles like any of our other rabbits did .
she is inquisitive and incredibly bright for a rabbit , and has often been known to play games with us .
yet she was abused , or at least neglected -lrb- which is of course just a form of abuse -rrb- .
taking care of rabbits is n't that difficult .
it requires dedication and work , just as owning any other animal does .
people need to be sure they have 8-15 years to dedicate to caring for a rabbit before they buy one - they are much longer lived than most realize .
amanda , norwich , uk i discovered not only a guinea pig and a lop eared rabbit what must have been hours after being dumped in the middle of a heavily forested suburb .
the hutch and feeding and drinking bowls were there including a pile of sawdust , the guinea pig i caught and knew of someone who would care for it alongside other pets their very responsible children had .
the rabbit was afraid and ran off into the woods only to be discovered dead where it had been left , it had obviously gone back to its pal and the home it had known , it is so wrong to think by releasing domestic pets into a wild environment would be a kind thing to do , they would be lucky to last the first night .
duncan quick , york , north yorkshire .
many problems these days seem to be children thinking a rabbit is cute and fluffy and small , but they grow and require lots of attention , time and money -lrb- much like the children do ! -rrb- which kids these days can not deal with .
whilst rabbits are small and cute , they are n't cheap .
home visits should be carried out to ensure rabbits are kept in a suitable environment , much like with cats and dogs .
my sisters have not found caring for their rabbits to be a burden because of the joy that they bring , and it disgusts me to think that so many parents have such a flippant attitude towards their actions .
gemma , sheffield , uk rabbits are great pets , if you are prepared to care for them .
i have 2 rescue rabbits and everyone acknowledges they are mine and not the children 's .
the care involved is huge , as much as owning a large dog. they need daily hygiene , a minimum of 2 hours of exercise , play and entertainment , some need daily grooming and all rabbits need a varied diet including mixed fresh vegetables .
i have advised many friends that have asked about rabbit ownership to consider the amount of care involved before making any purchases , and i try to ensure they understand how many bunnies need rehoming before they look at the cute bundles of fluff in a pet shop .
sharron , chandlers ford , hampshire i have two rabbits and they are perfectly healthy .
you just have to see that they are living breathing animals that need your love and care .
you ca n't just say " i 'm not going to clean their hutch or let them out because i do n't feel like it . "
anonymous , can someone explain what gives a human being the right to turn wild animals into pets ?
and what exactly does keeping a pet teach a child ?
how about observing animals free and in their natural habitat instead ?
of course patient observing of nature requires more effort , more involvement , and more knowledge , from the parents .
it teaches a child -lrb- and her parents ! -rrb- how to observe , it encourages her to be inquisitive and to try to interpret and question what she observes .
it also teaches respect for animals and nature , and readily leads to other worthwhile activities or hobbies .
much healthier for everyone than keeping a pet in a cage i think .
any thought anyone ?
pascal , london i rescued my pet rabbit , she 'd had been locked in a cage 24/7 ..
she now has a happy life here with us , she lives in the house with us & makes a great little pet ..
how can people be so cruel ?
if you have a rabbit make sure the hutch is big enough & please please make sure they have a decent size run .. karen mills , wrexham i cant understand some people .
how hard is it to look after a rabbit ? we decided to get my son a rabbit and we got a northumberland dwarf as they do n't grow very big , a little tip for people with a medium sized cage , also we got a male as they are they are the less aggressive type , and he 's gorgeous. we keep him in a hutch and he is fed twice a day , twice a week he has a treat of fresh veg , when weather is not too bad we just let him run about for an hour and he loves and springs about , we recently had his nails clipped and the vet said he was very healthy , he now comes to you when you feed him and nuzzles your hand , and do you know what i find it ten times easier looking after our rabbit than keeping up with all the housework , so come on people , no excuses ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! julie , sheffield we took a rabbit from one of the national pet shop chains as he looked in poor condition and cowering in a corner .
our rabbit is still very timid , over 2 years on and he has had some severe health problems which means he can not live outside , he lives in our house now and has the free run of the house , in essence , he 's a house bunny .
if you are going to get a rabbit , ensure that you can look after them , they need food , water , fruit and veg every day , plus hay .
they need grooming , neutering and plenty of exercise and attention .
we adore our rabbit and he gives us so much pleasure but they do require a lot of love , care and attention .
rabbits give so much back but if you ca n't afford to give them the time they deserve , please do n't buy one and please do n't buy one as a christmas present .
iona pippen , caerphilly i have 3 rabbits .
to give them up or to abandon them is just not a option .
it is hard work looking after the hutches in winter but i still get out there when its cold and clean them and feed them .
in the summer i trim there nails and let them out for runs .
they are the nicest creatures ever .
a message for all readers , " do n't abandon them always ring the rspca and get them taken away with dignity " .
yasmine , rotherham animal cruelty still shocks me every time i hear it .
i myself have 2 rabbits , 2 guinea pigs & 2 hamsters and i love them all so much .
i was surprised of how much hard work looking after a rabbit it .
there about the same hard work as a dog. all animals need excersise and a good diet and love and attention of course. but rabbits have a very sensitive stomach , need at least 2 hours of love & and affection a day and of course need to be let out of there cage for a few hours at least !
the punishment for animal cruelty should be firmer. not just a slap on the hand ! katie hamlet , aberystwyth , wales yes , i 've rescued a rabbit and i 'm waiting to rescue my next one .
it 's terrible to read what 's happening as rabbits make fantastic pets .
all you need is a bit of space and then watch them run , jump and play .
they are so funny to watch but sticking them in a teeny weeny hutch does n't let children -lrb- and adults -rrb- see their full potential .
they 're more playful than adult cats for example .
if you want a rabbit get the biggest hutch you can and a large run and get in there with them - you 're kids will be soon like my 3 year old son - ca n't get enough !
sarah miles , worcestershire we found a rabbit in the gutter five years ago .
nobody claimed her so we kept her but she has cost a considerable amount of money in vet bills over that time .
as much as we like her , a rabbit would not be first on our list of pets .
to throw a rabbit into a hutch and think that that 's all the life it needs is just wrong and cruel , they need a lot more mental stimulation than that .
as for them being a good children 's pet , that 's a myth , children will grow bored of them quickly , and rabbits are more fragile than people believe , serious back injury not being uncommon if they fall or jump the wrong way .
they should not be a disposable commodity in this disposable society .
carol brown , adelaide australia we 've had rabbits in my family for years and we always get them for rspca rescue centres .
it 's beyond me why anyone would pay for one at a pet shop when there are so many who needs homes and might be put down if they do n't find one .
to buy a pet without realising what 's involved and that you might get bored of it is sheer idiocy .
get a rabbit because you have compassion towards animals and rabbits and want it to be part of your family .
do n't get it if you really ca n't be bothered to pay for it , clean its hutch or let it run around for a few hours a day .
it just causes suffering .
andrew , nottingham , uk as a vet with a large primary and referral caseload in rabbits i see this every day .
people get bored of the rabbits very quickly , and have n't researched the costs and keeping of their animals at all .
it 's sickening to think i only see the ones who are honourable enough to bring their animal to us and admit their failure .
if a rabbit is healthy we do what we can to rehome it but it 's a losing battle .
i regularly see rabbits living to 10 years old , some to 12 , and those are the lucky ones .
the second commonest cruelty cases i consult for the rspca are abandoned rabbits , and we investigate those thoroughly - those we catch are prosecuted .
it is heartbreaking to see animals just dumped in the middle of a park with no food or water simply because ignorant people got tired of taking care of them .
with housing facilities at breaking point we have to be ruthless about those we keep , and those we have to euthanase .
it 's disgraceful we 're put in that position by those who take on what they can not care for .
the estimate of costs for keeping a rabbit in the article is about right .
the other problem is people not feeding their rabbits properly .
hay .
grass .
hay .
grass .
that 's it .
perhaps a supplement if you want to .
" mixes " and so on will just end up in dental disease , and a lifetime of pain and discomfort , and a huge vets ' bill .
think before you buy .
william easson , cardiff , wales i was given a rabbit about 6 years ago as a gift .
to be honest in the first week i was n't sure if i wanted him as i knew nothing about rabbits and i was bit nervous if he would bite me and from the way he would sprint around the room so fast i just got put off and at night would put him back in the hutch .
six years later i still have him and would never give him away as he is so intelligent , fun and affectionate and crafty i sometimes forget his a rabbit from the way he behaves .
he is litter trained and when he knows i have been into the kitchen he comes sprinting towards me as he knows his getting a treat .
the bottom line is although rabbits are not like other animals and do n't really make noise they are very sociable animals and the more time you spend with them the end results are amazing .
just because they are quiet and not like a puppy or kitten that does n't mean people should abuse them in anyway as they are also very delicate animals .
i love my bunny so much i let him i sleep in a massive indoor cage that i purchased that has ramps and toys for him .
rabbits get very stressed easily and it is not right to keep them locked in their hutch for too long .
i strongly feel that people should not be allowed to purchase rabbits or any animal for that fact if they are going to think of it as a short term interest .
rabbits are hard work as i know how many times i clean his cage and feed him because its not humane to let them stay in a dirty cage .
jay jay has been a really nice experience for me that six years ago i would have laughed but if you give it a chance and spend time with your rabbit the rewards you get back are priceless .
liza fortes , sudbury uk i have 8 rabbits , 4 of which are rescues .
one was found running around our road and nobody ever claimed him .
i have had him for 4 years now .
even though i handle him every day and he has been castrated he is still aggressive and i doubt he will ever get over anything that happened to him before he came to me .
another was used to breed baby rabbits to be used as food for snakes .
she was pregnant when she came to me .
she killed all the babies .
think of the animal and not your children .
they do n't need a rabbit .
it wo n't teach them responsibility .
maybe if people stopped buying them the demand would n't be there and people would n't be irresponsibly breeding them .
break that circle. em , bristol , uk i got my two rabbits from greenwich rabbit rescue .
both were 3 month old minilops , from different homes .
after some unsettled and anxious behaviour like peeing on my lap , running away from pointing fingers or nipping and keeping jaws open , they are now almost docile .
they pretty much have the run of the house , and when it 's not too cold , run around the garden for a few hours .
there is daily hutch cleaning and feeding , but otherwise , they are happy to lounge and hop about .
i have no kids , so maybe that helps. martha rumian , london uk i have taken in 2 rabbits over the years which were unwanted pets .
i have also taken in budgies , hamsters , and a dog which were all unwanted .
it really annoys me that people do n't think long term about pets and are quick to dismiss them .
bring back licences - as anyone prepared to buy a licence will be prepared to look after a pet long term .
it is something that should be taught in school - the cost and effort that goes into owning a pet -lrb- babies as well -rrb- .
i only support animal charities , and being so soft over animals , people will always come to me first with any unwanted pets - and i ca n't say no .
my local paper often advertises pieces on animal care - could this be done nationally ?
paula flinders , nottinghamshire i found our rabbit in our garden on 4 jan 04 .
i had seen her around the neighbourhood , under parked cars and running through the bushes .
i caught her and brought her into our home .
this is where she stayed for nearly 2 years , as my house rabbit .
she was very easy to train , she had a hutch in the utility room which was always open , there was a litter tray next to the hutch .
the back door to the garden was always open so she could hop in and out when she felt like it and when the weather was fine , she even used to hop back in to use the litter tray .
i have three children from 18 down to 12 and they adored her but she was my rabbit when it came to feeding , cleaning and clipping nails .
they just gave her a name ; fubu .
i had to have her put down last christmas as she had arthritis in her back legs due to the bad diet and care she used to suffer from .
this was heartbreaking to watch in such a friendly animal but this is what happens when people do n't care enough about their pets . !
ellen plowman , chippenham wilts i " adopted " a rabbit nobody else wanted when i was a child .
i 'm now 51 .
i still remember him along with the cats and dogs i 've had since then .
i remember the love i felt for him , the unconsolable sadness i felt when he died .
the feelings generated by loving and caring for my pets and the responsibility involved are things that i 've tried to pass on to my children .
i 'm absolutely sure this has made us better people .
i now have three abandoned cats and an abandoned dog .
abandoning pets says something about who we are and the society we 've all " helped " to create .
none of us should ignore this fact .
liz brindley , baiona , spain rabbits are social animals and so need company .
if you are going to keep a rabbit outdoors in a hutch they should be kept in neutered / spayed pairs for company .
the best combination is a male and a female .
if kept on their own rabbits can become very depressed .
a hutch should be large enough for the rabbits to stand up on their back legs and have a permanently attached run for exercise .
if you are going to keep rabbits with enough attention to their welfare then please bear in mind that they are not cheap pets .
the initial set up costs for a pair of rabbits with a suitable hutch , vaccinations , neutering / spaying and food is around £ 600 .
if you are n't prepared to spend this sort of money then you really should n't buy them because to not provide all they need is cruel .
having said all that rabbits make excellent pets , we have two which actually live in the house and give us many hours of pleasure .
in case you are wondering they are very clean and are easily litter trained !
richard thacker , bristol i recently took on a rabbit that someone no longer wanted .
he was kept in a tiny hutch 24 hours a day and rarely had any water or adequate food .
he now has a 7ft enclosure and run of the garden when we are home .
i have bonded him with my female and they are totally happy .
rabbits are not kids pets .
they can be feisty , hard to hold when fully grown and territorial when not neutered .
only get a rabbit if an adult will ultimately be responsible for it .
kids can not be expected to take sole responsibility for one .
rabbits should not be kept alone , or with a guinea pig .
they should be neutered , vaccinated , have time spent with them , get regular daily exercise , a good diet including a supply of hay constantly , the list is endless .
please , please , do not buy a rabbit on a whim without giving it a lot of thought .
please also do not buy from a pet shop when there are so many animals in rescue .
kate , birmingham , west midlands in 1997 we found a french lop rabbit that had been dumped and she was most probably was an unwanted easter bunny that was bought for a kid who grew bored of her .
many parents sadly give in to temptation and buy rabbits as pets for their kids on the spare of the moment no thought in their future care etc , not meaning to be cruel but the children just lose interest after a while and therefore the poor bunny suffers , locked up in its cage or even has no food or water .
many cages are way to small that they sell in pet shops and the poor bunnies who once fitted in them as babies and then soon row soon outgrow their enclosures and therefore have no room to move .
thumper was lucky we rescued her and lived a very long and happy life estimated to be between 9-13 years old , many parents need to be aware of the costs rabbits can occur in their lifetime which can be 7years or more ! and also they need to be aware that they need vaccinating against deadly diseases such as vhd and myximotosis. lisa yates , manchester i am only 14 we 've had 1 rabbit loads of hamsters and 3 guinea pigs our guinea pigs have out lasted all the hamsters and 1 of our dogs .
they live a longer healthier life if you let them outside in summer and inside for a run about in winter they also receive fresh fruit and veg at night and are know over 12 years old zoe handley -lrb- 14 -rrb- , derby uk last week i saved two lionhead rabbits 1 girl and 1 boy they were about 3 month old , which were housed in a small bird cage , they were living in filthy conditions they had no food or clean water .
thy female rabbit was really skinny and had large amounts of matted fur around her rear end , it took 45 mins to cut it away. they are now both happy and healthy rabbits. i already have 4 rabbits of my own , and they are in healthy condition , they are let out of their hutches everyday from 7.00am-8.30-9.00pm -lrb- into a 16foot log cabin , with mesh windows -rrb- and are cleaned twice a week , they are also provided with fresh greens everyday , i also have live with two lovely rottweiller who play and clean the rabbits. i think that if people are thinking of owing rabbits they should do some research before hand , because its not as easy as it looks. victoria , bedfordshire e-mail this to a friend printable version video and audio news rabbits need a lot of social stimulation see also animal cases shock rspca officers 10 nov 06 -pipe- cornwall family rabbits stabbed to death 19 sep 06 -pipe- north east / n isles poorly rabbits dumped on roadside 22 aug 06 -pipe- coventry / warwickshire rspca criticises ' rabbit wedding ' 04 apr 06 -pipe- hereford / worcs crisis as pets breed like rabbits 20 feb 06 -pipe- lincolnshire related bbc links your pet rabbit related internet links rabbit welfare association rspca the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top uk stories fears over child intensive care vicar forgives daughter 's killers flooding warnings for parts of uk most popular stories now most shared most read alcohol ' protects men 's hearts ' affectionate cat distracts policeman driver lost on 600km shops trip commuter cat is star of bus route power-guzzling tvs to be banned most popular now , in detail most shared most read ' complacency ' led to us sub crash alcohol ' protects men 's hearts ' power-guzzling tvs to be banned rabbi ' offered cocaine for sex ' somali woman stoned for adultery driver lost on 600km shops trip vicar forgives daughter 's killers woman held in sex abuse inquiry bangladesh tense ahead of verdict obama and lee urge n korea talks most popular now , in detail features , views , analysis election in doubt will political rows derail iraq 's january polls ?

there about the same hard work as a dog. all animals need excersise and a good diet and love and attention of course. but rabbits have a very sensitive stomach , need at least 2 hours of love & and affection a day and of course need to be let out of there cage for a few hours at least !

it 's terrible to read what 's happening as rabbits make fantastic pets .
all you need is a bit of space and then watch them run , jump and play .
they are so funny to watch but sticking them in a teeny weeny hutch does n't let children -lrb- and adults -rrb- see their full potential .
they 're more playful than adult cats for example .
if you want a rabbit get the biggest hutch you can and a large run and get in there with them - you 're kids will be soon like my 3 year old son - ca n't get enough !

it 's beyond me why anyone would pay for one at a pet shop when there are so many who needs homes and might be put down if they do n't find one .
to buy a pet without realising what 's involved and that you might get bored of it is sheer idiocy .
get a rabbit because you have compassion towards animals and rabbits and want it to be part of your family .
do n't get it if you really ca n't be bothered to pay for it , clean its hutch or let it run around for a few hours a day .
it just causes suffering .
andrew , nottingham , uk as a vet with a large primary and referral caseload in rabbits i see this every day .
people get bored of the rabbits very quickly , and have n't researched the costs and keeping of their animals at all .
it 's sickening to think i only see the ones who are honourable enough to bring their animal to us and admit their failure .
if a rabbit is healthy we do what we can to rehome it but it 's a losing battle .

william easson , cardiff , wales i was given a rabbit about 6 years ago as a gift .
to be honest in the first week i was n't sure if i wanted him as i knew nothing about rabbits and i was bit nervous if he would bite me and from the way he would sprint around the room so fast i just got put off and at night would put him back in the hutch .
six years later i still have him and would never give him away as he is so intelligent , fun and affectionate and crafty i sometimes forget his a rabbit from the way he behaves .
he is litter trained and when he knows i have been into the kitchen he comes sprinting towards me as he knows his getting a treat .
the bottom line is although rabbits are not like other animals and do n't really make noise they are very sociable animals and the more time you spend with them the end results are amazing .
just because they are quiet and not like a puppy or kitten that does n't mean people should abuse them in anyway as they are also very delicate animals .
i love my bunny so much i let him i sleep in a massive indoor cage that i purchased that has ramps and toys for him .
rabbits get very stressed easily and it is not right to keep them locked in their hutch for too long .
i strongly feel that people should not be allowed to purchase rabbits or any animal for that fact if they are going to think of it as a short term interest .
rabbits are hard work as i know how many times i clean his cage and feed him because its not humane to let them stay in a dirty cage .

liza fortes , sudbury uk i have 8 rabbits , 4 of which are rescues .

another was used to breed baby rabbits to be used as food for snakes .
she was pregnant when she came to me .
she killed all the babies .

they do n't need a rabbit .
it wo n't teach them responsibility .
maybe if people stopped buying them the demand would n't be there and people would n't be irresponsibly breeding them .
break that circle. em , bristol , uk i got my two rabbits from greenwich rabbit rescue .
both were 3 month old minilops , from different homes .
after some unsettled and anxious behaviour like peeing on my lap , running away from pointing fingers or nipping and keeping jaws open , they are now almost docile .
they pretty much have the run of the house , and when it 's not too cold , run around the garden for a few hours .
there is daily hutch cleaning and feeding , but otherwise , they are happy to lounge and hop about .
i have no kids , so maybe that helps. martha rumian , london uk i have taken in 2 rabbits over the years which were unwanted pets .
i have also taken in budgies , hamsters , and a dog which were all unwanted .
it really annoys me that people do n't think long term about pets and are quick to dismiss them .
bring back licences - as anyone prepared to buy a licence will be prepared to look after a pet long term .
it is something that should be taught in school - the cost and effort that goes into owning a pet -lrb- babies as well -rrb- .
i only support animal charities , and being so soft over animals , people will always come to me first with any unwanted pets - and i ca n't say no .
my local paper often advertises pieces on animal care - could this be done nationally ?
paula flinders , nottinghamshire i found our rabbit in our garden on 4 jan 04 .
i had seen her around the neighbourhood , under parked cars and running through the bushes .
i caught her and brought her into our home .
this is where she stayed for nearly 2 years , as my house rabbit .
she was very easy to train , she had a hutch in the utility room which was always open , there was a litter tray next to the hutch .
the back door to the garden was always open so she could hop in and out when she felt like it and when the weather was fine , she even used to hop back in to use the litter tray .
i have three children from 18 down to 12 and they adored her but she was my rabbit when it came to feeding , cleaning and clipping nails .
they just gave her a name ; fubu .
i had to have her put down last christmas as she had arthritis in her back legs due to the bad diet and care she used to suffer from .
this was heartbreaking to watch in such a friendly animal but this is what happens when people do n't care enough about their pets . !
ellen plowman , chippenham wilts i " adopted " a rabbit nobody else wanted when i was a child .
i 'm now 51 .
i still remember him along with the cats and dogs i 've had since then .
i remember the love i felt for him , the unconsolable sadness i felt when he died .
the feelings generated by loving and caring for my pets and the responsibility involved are things that i 've tried to pass on to my children .
i 'm absolutely sure this has made us better people .
i now have three abandoned cats and an abandoned dog .
abandoning pets says something about who we are and the society we 've all " helped " to create .
none of us should ignore this fact .
liz brindley , baiona , spain rabbits are social animals and so need company .
if you are going to keep a rabbit outdoors in a hutch they should be kept in neutered / spayed pairs for company .
the best combination is a male and a female .
if kept on their own rabbits can become very depressed .
a hutch should be large enough for the rabbits to stand up on their back legs and have a permanently attached run for exercise .
if you are going to keep rabbits with enough attention to their welfare then please bear in mind that they are not cheap pets .
the initial set up costs for a pair of rabbits with a suitable hutch , vaccinations , neutering / spaying and food is around £ 600 .
if you are n't prepared to spend this sort of money then you really should n't buy them because to not provide all they need is cruel .
having said all that rabbits make excellent pets , we have two which actually live in the house and give us many hours of pleasure .
in case you are wondering they are very clean and are easily litter trained !
richard thacker , bristol i recently took on a rabbit that someone no longer wanted .
he was kept in a tiny hutch 24 hours a day and rarely had any water or adequate food .
he now has a 7ft enclosure and run of the garden when we are home .
i have bonded him with my female and they are totally happy .
rabbits are not kids pets .
they can be feisty , hard to hold when fully grown and territorial when not neutered .
only get a rabbit if an adult will ultimately be responsible for it .
kids can not be expected to take sole responsibility for one .
rabbits should not be kept alone , or with a guinea pig .
they should be neutered , vaccinated , have time spent with them , get regular daily exercise , a good diet including a supply of hay constantly , the list is endless .
please , please , do not buy a rabbit on a whim without giving it a lot of thought .
please also do not buy from a pet shop when there are so many animals in rescue .
kate , birmingham , west midlands in 1997 we found a french lop rabbit that had been dumped and she was most probably was an unwanted easter bunny that was bought for a kid who grew bored of her .
many parents sadly give in to temptation and buy rabbits as pets for their kids on the spare of the moment no thought in their future care etc , not meaning to be cruel but the children just lose interest after a while and therefore the poor bunny suffers , locked up in its cage or even has no food or water .
many cages are way to small that they sell in pet shops and the poor bunnies who once fitted in them as babies and then soon row soon outgrow their enclosures and therefore have no room to move .
thumper was lucky we rescued her and lived a very long and happy life estimated to be between 9-13 years old , many parents need to be aware of the costs rabbits can occur in their lifetime which can be 7years or more ! and also they need to be aware that they need vaccinating against deadly diseases such as vhd and myximotosis. lisa yates , manchester i am only 14 we 've had 1 rabbit loads of hamsters and 3 guinea pigs our guinea pigs have out lasted all the hamsters and 1 of our dogs .
they live a longer healthier life if you let them outside in summer and inside for a run about in winter they also receive fresh fruit and veg at night and are know over 12 years old zoe handley -lrb- 14 -rrb- , derby uk last week i saved two lionhead rabbits 1 girl and 1 boy they were about 3 month old , which were housed in a small bird cage , they were living in filthy conditions they had no food or clean water .
thy female rabbit was really skinny and had large amounts of matted fur around her rear end , it took 45 mins to cut it away. they are now both happy and healthy rabbits. i already have 4 rabbits of my own , and they are in healthy condition , they are let out of their hutches everyday from 7.00am-8.30-9.00pm -lrb- into a 16foot log cabin , with mesh windows -rrb- and are cleaned twice a week , they are also provided with fresh greens everyday , i also have live with two lovely rottweiller who play and clean the rabbits. i think that if people are thinking of owing rabbits they should do some research before hand , because its not as easy as it looks. victoria , bedfordshire e-mail this to a friend printable version video and audio news rabbits need a lot of social stimulation see also animal cases shock rspca officers 10 nov 06 -pipe- cornwall family rabbits stabbed to death 19 sep 06 -pipe- north east / n isles poorly rabbits dumped on roadside 22 aug 06 -pipe- coventry / warwickshire rspca criticises ' rabbit wedding ' 04 apr 06 -pipe- hereford / worcs crisis as pets breed like rabbits 20 feb 06 -pipe- lincolnshire related bbc links your pet rabbit related internet links rabbit welfare association rspca the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top uk stories major manhunt for afghan soldier unemployment dips to 2.47 million pm condemns sympathy for moat most popular stories now most shared most read seeing the teenager in the brain halal holidays in the sun most popular now , in detail most shared most read ' runaway train ' on london tube teenage girl raped in city centre swede faces $ 1m speeding penalty germany in ' record ' 2.2 % growth peru battles killer vampire bats meteors still set for ' good show ' afghan army offensive ' ambushed ' are picky eaters ' genes to blame ?

the animal charity said a survey found that 70 % of rescued rabbits had been kept hutched 24 hours a day .
almost 40 % had had no food , and half had been living in filthy conditions , it told the bbc .
it found that people bought rabbits but then quickly lost interest .
on average the abandoned pets it came across had been dumped after just three months .
many were simply released in the street or into the wild .
responsibility rabbits are the third most popular pet after cats and dogs and the rspca says that rescue centres are struggling to cope with the 35,000 unwanted pets abandoned every year .
if you did n't have the children , would you be keen to have the rabbit ?
anne mitchell , rabbit welfare association send us your comments anne mitchell from the rabbit welfare association warned that parents needed to realise the responsibilities that go with caring for rabbits .
the animals can live for up to eight years and cost £ 4,000 over their lifetime .
" if you did n't have the children , would you be keen to have the rabbit ?
if you would n't , do n't do it , " she said .
" ninety percent of children get bored , they 're tired very quickly of the chores .
" you ca n't treat it like barbie doll and action man and just stuff it in the cupboard under the stairs , although sadly some of these rabbits do end up like that , totally neglected . "
the rspca statistics will be released next week as part of a survey into rabbit welfare .
here are some of your comments : i think the estimate of £ 4k to keep a rabbit is a little on the high side .
like with any pet , you should always make sure you have a contingency fund for treating any unforeseen illness , but pellets , hay , treats and veg for my house bunny cost no more than £ 20 per month .
it 's a shame to think of people deciding against rescuing a rabbit because of the expense .
i 'm sure most spend twice that on their mobile phone bills !
shona , glasgow about 15 years ago my neighbours were moving and had a rabbit which had lost most of it 's hair due to alopecia they tried to persuade me to have the rabbit so i rang my sister who had young children she gave a home to the rabbit and after a couple of visits to the vet all it 's hair came back and it lived several years happily until it was killed by a fox -lrb- in fulham of all places -rrb- charlie mortimer , london , uk my family has had three rabbits over the years , and the latest one is a rescue .
she was obviously abused , because even after 6 years , she still bites and growls and lunges at us on occasion and is very difficult to pick up for a cuddle .
however , she can also be incredibly sweet , and once she is picked up , nuzzles and snuggles like any of our other rabbits did .
she is inquisitive and incredibly bright for a rabbit , and has often been known to play games with us .
yet she was abused , or at least neglected -lrb- which is of course just a form of abuse -rrb- .
taking care of rabbits is n't that difficult .
it requires dedication and work , just as owning any other animal does .
people need to be sure they have 8-15 years to dedicate to caring for a rabbit before they buy one - they are much longer lived than most realize .
amanda , norwich , uk i discovered not only a guinea pig and a lop eared rabbit what must have been hours after being dumped in the middle of a heavily forested suburb .
the hutch and feeding and drinking bowls were there including a pile of sawdust , the guinea pig i caught and knew of someone who would care for it alongside other pets their very responsible children had .
the rabbit was afraid and ran off into the woods only to be discovered dead where it had been left , it had obviously gone back to its pal and the home it had known , it is so wrong to think by releasing domestic pets into a wild environment would be a kind thing to do , they would be lucky to last the first night .
duncan quick , york , north yorkshire .
many problems these days seem to be children thinking a rabbit is cute and fluffy and small , but they grow and require lots of attention , time and money -lrb- much like the children do ! -rrb- which kids these days can not deal with .
whilst rabbits are small and cute , they are n't cheap .
home visits should be carried out to ensure rabbits are kept in a suitable environment , much like with cats and dogs .
my sisters have not found caring for their rabbits to be a burden because of the joy that they bring , and it disgusts me to think that so many parents have such a flippant attitude towards their actions .
gemma , sheffield , uk rabbits are great pets , if you are prepared to care for them .
i have 2 rescue rabbits and everyone acknowledges they are mine and not the children 's .
the care involved is huge , as much as owning a large dog. they need daily hygiene , a minimum of 2 hours of exercise , play and entertainment , some need daily grooming and all rabbits need a varied diet including mixed fresh vegetables .
i have advised many friends that have asked about rabbit ownership to consider the amount of care involved before making any purchases , and i try to ensure they understand how many bunnies need rehoming before they look at the cute bundles of fluff in a pet shop .
sharron , chandlers ford , hampshire i have two rabbits and they are perfectly healthy .
you just have to see that they are living breathing animals that need your love and care .
you ca n't just say " i 'm not going to clean their hutch or let them out because i do n't feel like it . "
anonymous , can someone explain what gives a human being the right to turn wild animals into pets ?
and what exactly does keeping a pet teach a child ?
how about observing animals free and in their natural habitat instead ?
of course patient observing of nature requires more effort , more involvement , and more knowledge , from the parents .
it teaches a child -lrb- and her parents ! -rrb- how to observe , it encourages her to be inquisitive and to try to interpret and question what she observes .
it also teaches respect for animals and nature , and readily leads to other worthwhile activities or hobbies .
much healthier for everyone than keeping a pet in a cage i think .
any thought anyone ?
pascal , london i rescued my pet rabbit , she 'd had been locked in a cage 24/7 ..
she now has a happy life here with us , she lives in the house with us & makes a great little pet ..
how can people be so cruel ?
if you have a rabbit make sure the hutch is big enough & please please make sure they have a decent size run .. karen mills , wrexham i cant understand some people .
how hard is it to look after a rabbit ? we decided to get my son a rabbit and we got a northumberland dwarf as they do n't grow very big , a little tip for people with a medium sized cage , also we got a male as they are they are the less aggressive type , and he 's gorgeous. we keep him in a hutch and he is fed twice a day , twice a week he has a treat of fresh veg , when weather is not too bad we just let him run about for an hour and he loves and springs about , we recently had his nails clipped and the vet said he was very healthy , he now comes to you when you feed him and nuzzles your hand , and do you know what i find it ten times easier looking after our rabbit than keeping up with all the housework , so come on people , no excuses ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! julie , sheffield we took a rabbit from one of the national pet shop chains as he looked in poor condition and cowering in a corner .
our rabbit is still very timid , over 2 years on and he has had some severe health problems which means he can not live outside , he lives in our house now and has the free run of the house , in essence , he 's a house bunny .
if you are going to get a rabbit , ensure that you can look after them , they need food , water , fruit and veg every day , plus hay .
they need grooming , neutering and plenty of exercise and attention .
we adore our rabbit and he gives us so much pleasure but they do require a lot of love , care and attention .
rabbits give so much back but if you ca n't afford to give them the time they deserve , please do n't buy one and please do n't buy one as a christmas present .

the back door to the garden was always open so she could hop in and out when she felt like it and when the weather was fine , she even used to hop back in to use the litter tray .
i have three children from 18 down to 12 and they adored her but she was my rabbit when it came to feeding , cleaning and clipping nails .
they just gave her a name ; fubu .
i had to have her put down last christmas as she had arthritis in her back legs due to the bad diet and care she used to suffer from .
this was heartbreaking to watch in such a friendly animal but this is what happens when people do n't care enough about their pets . !
ellen plowman , chippenham wilts i " adopted " a rabbit nobody else wanted when i was a child .
i 'm now 51 .
i still remember him along with the cats and dogs i 've had since then .
i remember the love i felt for him , the unconsolable sadness i felt when he died .
the feelings generated by loving and caring for my pets and the responsibility involved are things that i 've tried to pass on to my children .
i 'm absolutely sure this has made us better people .

none of us should ignore this fact .
liz brindley , baiona , spain rabbits are social animals and so need company .
if you are going to keep a rabbit outdoors in a hutch they should be kept in neutered / spayed pairs for company .
the best combination is a male and a female .
if kept on their own rabbits can become very depressed .
a hutch should be large enough for the rabbits to stand up on their back legs and have a permanently attached run for exercise .
if you are going to keep rabbits with enough attention to their welfare then please bear in mind that they are not cheap pets .
the initial set up costs for a pair of rabbits with a suitable hutch , vaccinations , neutering / spaying and food is around £ 600 .
if you are n't prepared to spend this sort of money then you really should n't buy them because to not provide all they need is cruel .
having said all that rabbits make excellent pets , we have two which actually live in the house and give us many hours of pleasure .
in case you are wondering they are very clean and are easily litter trained !
richard thacker , bristol i recently took on a rabbit that someone no longer wanted .
he was kept in a tiny hutch 24 hours a day and rarely had any water or adequate food .
he now has a 7ft enclosure and run of the garden when we are home .
i have bonded him with my female and they are totally happy .
rabbits are not kids pets .
they can be feisty , hard to hold when fully grown and territorial when not neutered .
only get a rabbit if an adult will ultimately be responsible for it .
kids can not be expected to take sole responsibility for one .
rabbits should not be kept alone , or with a guinea pig .
they should be neutered , vaccinated , have time spent with them , get regular daily exercise , a good diet including a supply of hay constantly , the list is endless .
please , please , do not buy a rabbit on a whim without giving it a lot of thought .
please also do not buy from a pet shop when there are so many animals in rescue .
kate , birmingham , west midlands in 1997 we found a french lop rabbit that had been dumped and she was most probably was an unwanted easter bunny that was bought for a kid who grew bored of her .
many parents sadly give in to temptation and buy rabbits as pets for their kids on the spare of the moment no thought in their future care etc , not meaning to be cruel but the children just lose interest after a while and therefore the poor bunny suffers , locked up in its cage or even has no food or water .
many cages are way to small that they sell in pet shops and the poor bunnies who once fitted in them as babies and then soon row soon outgrow their enclosures and therefore have no room to move .
thumper was lucky we rescued her and lived a very long and happy life estimated to be between 9-13 years old , many parents need to be aware of the costs rabbits can occur in their lifetime which can be 7years or more ! and also they need to be aware that they need vaccinating against deadly diseases such as vhd and myximotosis. lisa yates , manchester i am only 14 we 've had 1 rabbit loads of hamsters and 3 guinea pigs our guinea pigs have out lasted all the hamsters and 1 of our dogs .

the animal charity said a survey found that 70 % of rescued rabbits had been kept hutched 24 hours a day .
almost 40 % had had no food , and half had been living in filthy conditions , it told the bbc .
it found that people bought rabbits but then quickly lost interest .
on average the abandoned pets it came across had been dumped after just three months .
many were simply released in the street or into the wild .
responsibility rabbits are the third most popular pet after cats and dogs and the rspca says that rescue centres are struggling to cope with the 35,000 unwanted pets abandoned every year .
if you did n't have the children , would you be keen to have the rabbit ?
anne mitchell , rabbit welfare association send us your comments anne mitchell from the rabbit welfare association warned that parents needed to realise the responsibilities that go with caring for rabbits .
the animals can live for up to eight years and cost £ 4,000 over their lifetime .
" if you did n't have the children , would you be keen to have the rabbit ?
if you would n't , do n't do it , " she said .
" ninety percent of children get bored , they 're tired very quickly of the chores .
" you ca n't treat it like barbie doll and action man and just stuff it in the cupboard under the stairs , although sadly some of these rabbits do end up like that , totally neglected . "
the rspca statistics will be released next week as part of a survey into rabbit welfare .
here are some of your comments : i think the estimate of £ 4k to keep a rabbit is a little on the high side .
like with any pet , you should always make sure you have a contingency fund for treating any unforeseen illness , but pellets , hay , treats and veg for my house bunny cost no more than £ 20 per month .
it 's a shame to think of people deciding against rescuing a rabbit because of the expense .
i 'm sure most spend twice that on their mobile phone bills !
shona , glasgow about 15 years ago my neighbours were moving and had a rabbit which had lost most of it 's hair due to alopecia they tried to persuade me to have the rabbit so i rang my sister who had young children she gave a home to the rabbit and after a couple of visits to the vet all it 's hair came back and it lived several years happily until it was killed by a fox -lrb- in fulham of all places -rrb- charlie mortimer , london , uk my family has had three rabbits over the years , and the latest one is a rescue .
she was obviously abused , because even after 6 years , she still bites and growls and lunges at us on occasion and is very difficult to pick up for a cuddle .
however , she can also be incredibly sweet , and once she is picked up , nuzzles and snuggles like any of our other rabbits did .
she is inquisitive and incredibly bright for a rabbit , and has often been known to play games with us .
yet she was abused , or at least neglected -lrb- which is of course just a form of abuse -rrb- .
taking care of rabbits is n't that difficult .
it requires dedication and work , just as owning any other animal does .
people need to be sure they have 8-15 years to dedicate to caring for a rabbit before they buy one - they are much longer lived than most realize .
amanda , norwich , uk i discovered not only a guinea pig and a lop eared rabbit what must have been hours after being dumped in the middle of a heavily forested suburb .
the hutch and feeding and drinking bowls were there including a pile of sawdust , the guinea pig i caught and knew of someone who would care for it alongside other pets their very responsible children had .
the rabbit was afraid and ran off into the woods only to be discovered dead where it had been left , it had obviously gone back to its pal and the home it had known , it is so wrong to think by releasing domestic pets into a wild environment would be a kind thing to do , they would be lucky to last the first night .
duncan quick , york , north yorkshire .
many problems these days seem to be children thinking a rabbit is cute and fluffy and small , but they grow and require lots of attention , time and money -lrb- much like the children do ! -rrb- which kids these days can not deal with .
whilst rabbits are small and cute , they are n't cheap .
home visits should be carried out to ensure rabbits are kept in a suitable environment , much like with cats and dogs .
my sisters have not found caring for their rabbits to be a burden because of the joy that they bring , and it disgusts me to think that so many parents have such a flippant attitude towards their actions .
gemma , sheffield , uk rabbits are great pets , if you are prepared to care for them .
i have 2 rescue rabbits and everyone acknowledges they are mine and not the children 's .
the care involved is huge , as much as owning a large dog. they need daily hygiene , a minimum of 2 hours of exercise , play and entertainment , some need daily grooming and all rabbits need a varied diet including mixed fresh vegetables .
i have advised many friends that have asked about rabbit ownership to consider the amount of care involved before making any purchases , and i try to ensure they understand how many bunnies need rehoming before they look at the cute bundles of fluff in a pet shop .
sharron , chandlers ford , hampshire i have two rabbits and they are perfectly healthy .
you just have to see that they are living breathing animals that need your love and care .
you ca n't just say " i 'm not going to clean their hutch or let them out because i do n't feel like it . "
anonymous , can someone explain what gives a human being the right to turn wild animals into pets ?
and what exactly does keeping a pet teach a child ?
how about observing animals free and in their natural habitat instead ?
of course patient observing of nature requires more effort , more involvement , and more knowledge , from the parents .
it teaches a child -lrb- and her parents ! -rrb- how to observe , it encourages her to be inquisitive and to try to interpret and question what she observes .
it also teaches respect for animals and nature , and readily leads to other worthwhile activities or hobbies .
much healthier for everyone than keeping a pet in a cage i think .
any thought anyone ?
pascal , london i rescued my pet rabbit , she 'd had been locked in a cage 24/7 ..
she now has a happy life here with us , she lives in the house with us & makes a great little pet ..
how can people be so cruel ?
if you have a rabbit make sure the hutch is big enough & please please make sure they have a decent size run .. karen mills , wrexham i cant understand some people .
how hard is it to look after a rabbit ? we decided to get my son a rabbit and we got a northumberland dwarf as they do n't grow very big , a little tip for people with a medium sized cage , also we got a male as they are they are the less aggressive type , and he 's gorgeous. we keep him in a hutch and he is fed twice a day , twice a week he has a treat of fresh veg , when weather is not too bad we just let him run about for an hour and he loves and springs about , we recently had his nails clipped and the vet said he was very healthy , he now comes to you when you feed him and nuzzles your hand , and do you know what i find it ten times easier looking after our rabbit than keeping up with all the housework , so come on people , no excuses ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! julie , sheffield we took a rabbit from one of the national pet shop chains as he looked in poor condition and cowering in a corner .
our rabbit is still very timid , over 2 years on and he has had some severe health problems which means he can not live outside , he lives in our house now and has the free run of the house , in essence , he 's a house bunny .
if you are going to get a rabbit , ensure that you can look after them , they need food , water , fruit and veg every day , plus hay .
they need grooming , neutering and plenty of exercise and attention .
we adore our rabbit and he gives us so much pleasure but they do require a lot of love , care and attention .
rabbits give so much back but if you ca n't afford to give them the time they deserve , please do n't buy one and please do n't buy one as a christmas present .
iona pippen , caerphilly i have 3 rabbits .
to give them up or to abandon them is just not a option .
it is hard work looking after the hutches in winter but i still get out there when its cold and clean them and feed them .
in the summer i trim there nails and let them out for runs .
they are the nicest creatures ever .
a message for all readers , " do n't abandon them always ring the rspca and get them taken away with dignity " .
yasmine , rotherham animal cruelty still shocks me every time i hear it .
i myself have 2 rabbits , 2 guinea pigs & 2 hamsters and i love them all so much .
i was surprised of how much hard work looking after a rabbit it .
there about the same hard work as a dog. all animals need excersise and a good diet and love and attention of course. but rabbits have a very sensitive stomach , need at least 2 hours of love & and affection a day and of course need to be let out of there cage for a few hours at least !
the punishment for animal cruelty should be firmer. not just a slap on the hand ! katie hamlet , aberystwyth , wales yes , i 've rescued a rabbit and i 'm waiting to rescue my next one .
it 's terrible to read what 's happening as rabbits make fantastic pets .
all you need is a bit of space and then watch them run , jump and play .
they are so funny to watch but sticking them in a teeny weeny hutch does n't let children -lrb- and adults -rrb- see their full potential .
they 're more playful than adult cats for example .
if you want a rabbit get the biggest hutch you can and a large run and get in there with them - you 're kids will be soon like my 3 year old son - ca n't get enough !
sarah miles , worcestershire we found a rabbit in the gutter five years ago .
nobody claimed her so we kept her but she has cost a considerable amount of money in vet bills over that time .
as much as we like her , a rabbit would not be first on our list of pets .
to throw a rabbit into a hutch and think that that 's all the life it needs is just wrong and cruel , they need a lot more mental stimulation than that .
as for them being a good children 's pet , that 's a myth , children will grow bored of them quickly , and rabbits are more fragile than people believe , serious back injury not being uncommon if they fall or jump the wrong way .
they should not be a disposable commodity in this disposable society .
carol brown , adelaide australia we 've had rabbits in my family for years and we always get them for rspca rescue centres .
it 's beyond me why anyone would pay for one at a pet shop when there are so many who needs homes and might be put down if they do n't find one .
to buy a pet without realising what 's involved and that you might get bored of it is sheer idiocy .
get a rabbit because you have compassion towards animals and rabbits and want it to be part of your family .
do n't get it if you really ca n't be bothered to pay for it , clean its hutch or let it run around for a few hours a day .
it just causes suffering .
andrew , nottingham , uk as a vet with a large primary and referral caseload in rabbits i see this every day .
people get bored of the rabbits very quickly , and have n't researched the costs and keeping of their animals at all .
it 's sickening to think i only see the ones who are honourable enough to bring their animal to us and admit their failure .
if a rabbit is healthy we do what we can to rehome it but it 's a losing battle .
i regularly see rabbits living to 10 years old , some to 12 , and those are the lucky ones .
the second commonest cruelty cases i consult for the rspca are abandoned rabbits , and we investigate those thoroughly - those we catch are prosecuted .
it is heartbreaking to see animals just dumped in the middle of a park with no food or water simply because ignorant people got tired of taking care of them .
with housing facilities at breaking point we have to be ruthless about those we keep , and those we have to euthanase .
it 's disgraceful we 're put in that position by those who take on what they can not care for .
the estimate of costs for keeping a rabbit in the article is about right .
the other problem is people not feeding their rabbits properly .
hay .
grass .
hay .
grass .
that 's it .
perhaps a supplement if you want to .
" mixes " and so on will just end up in dental disease , and a lifetime of pain and discomfort , and a huge vets ' bill .
think before you buy .
william easson , cardiff , wales i was given a rabbit about 6 years ago as a gift .
to be honest in the first week i was n't sure if i wanted him as i knew nothing about rabbits and i was bit nervous if he would bite me and from the way he would sprint around the room so fast i just got put off and at night would put him back in the hutch .
six years later i still have him and would never give him away as he is so intelligent , fun and affectionate and crafty i sometimes forget his a rabbit from the way he behaves .
he is litter trained and when he knows i have been into the kitchen he comes sprinting towards me as he knows his getting a treat .
the bottom line is although rabbits are not like other animals and do n't really make noise they are very sociable animals and the more time you spend with them the end results are amazing .
just because they are quiet and not like a puppy or kitten that does n't mean people should abuse them in anyway as they are also very delicate animals .
i love my bunny so much i let him i sleep in a massive indoor cage that i purchased that has ramps and toys for him .
rabbits get very stressed easily and it is not right to keep them locked in their hutch for too long .
i strongly feel that people should not be allowed to purchase rabbits or any animal for that fact if they are going to think of it as a short term interest .
rabbits are hard work as i know how many times i clean his cage and feed him because its not humane to let them stay in a dirty cage .
jay jay has been a really nice experience for me that six years ago i would have laughed but if you give it a chance and spend time with your rabbit the rewards you get back are priceless .
liza fortes , sudbury uk i have 8 rabbits , 4 of which are rescues .
one was found running around our road and nobody ever claimed him .
i have had him for 4 years now .
even though i handle him every day and he has been castrated he is still aggressive and i doubt he will ever get over anything that happened to him before he came to me .
another was used to breed baby rabbits to be used as food for snakes .
she was pregnant when she came to me .
she killed all the babies .
think of the animal and not your children .
they do n't need a rabbit .
it wo n't teach them responsibility .
maybe if people stopped buying them the demand would n't be there and people would n't be irresponsibly breeding them .
break that circle. em , bristol , uk i got my two rabbits from greenwich rabbit rescue .
both were 3 month old minilops , from different homes .
after some unsettled and anxious behaviour like peeing on my lap , running away from pointing fingers or nipping and keeping jaws open , they are now almost docile .
they pretty much have the run of the house , and when it 's not too cold , run around the garden for a few hours .
there is daily hutch cleaning and feeding , but otherwise , they are happy to lounge and hop about .
i have no kids , so maybe that helps. martha rumian , london uk i have taken in 2 rabbits over the years which were unwanted pets .
i have also taken in budgies , hamsters , and a dog which were all unwanted .
it really annoys me that people do n't think long term about pets and are quick to dismiss them .
bring back licences - as anyone prepared to buy a licence will be prepared to look after a pet long term .
it is something that should be taught in school - the cost and effort that goes into owning a pet -lrb- babies as well -rrb- .
i only support animal charities , and being so soft over animals , people will always come to me first with any unwanted pets - and i ca n't say no .
my local paper often advertises pieces on animal care - could this be done nationally ?
paula flinders , nottinghamshire i found our rabbit in our garden on 4 jan 04 .
i had seen her around the neighbourhood , under parked cars and running through the bushes .
i caught her and brought her into our home .
this is where she stayed for nearly 2 years , as my house rabbit .
she was very easy to train , she had a hutch in the utility room which was always open , there was a litter tray next to the hutch .

anne mitchell , rabbit welfare association send us your comments anne mitchell from the rabbit welfare association warned that parents needed to realise the responsibilities that go with caring for rabbits .
the animals can live for up to eight years and cost £ 4,000 over their lifetime .
" if you did n't have the children , would you be keen to have the rabbit ?
if you would n't , do n't do it , " she said .
" ninety percent of children get bored , they 're tired very quickly of the chores .
" you ca n't treat it like barbie doll and action man and just stuff it in the cupboard under the stairs , although sadly some of these rabbits do end up like that , totally neglected . "
the rspca statistics will be released next week as part of a survey into rabbit welfare .
here are some of your comments : i think the estimate of £ 4k to keep a rabbit is a little on the high side .
like with any pet , you should always make sure you have a contingency fund for treating any unforeseen illness , but pellets , hay , treats and veg for my house bunny cost no more than £ 20 per month .
it 's a shame to think of people deciding against rescuing a rabbit because of the expense .
i 'm sure most spend twice that on their mobile phone bills !
shona , glasgow about 15 years ago my neighbours were moving and had a rabbit which had lost most of it 's hair due to alopecia they tried to persuade me to have the rabbit so i rang my sister who had young children she gave a home to the rabbit and after a couple of visits to the vet all it 's hair came back and it lived several years happily until it was killed by a fox -lrb- in fulham of all places -rrb- charlie mortimer , london , uk my family has had three rabbits over the years , and the latest one is a rescue .
she was obviously abused , because even after 6 years , she still bites and growls and lunges at us on occasion and is very difficult to pick up for a cuddle .
however , she can also be incredibly sweet , and once she is picked up , nuzzles and snuggles like any of our other rabbits did .
she is inquisitive and incredibly bright for a rabbit , and has often been known to play games with us .
yet she was abused , or at least neglected -lrb- which is of course just a form of abuse -rrb- .
taking care of rabbits is n't that difficult .
it requires dedication and work , just as owning any other animal does .
people need to be sure they have 8-15 years to dedicate to caring for a rabbit before they buy one - they are much longer lived than most realize .
amanda , norwich , uk i discovered not only a guinea pig and a lop eared rabbit what must have been hours after being dumped in the middle of a heavily forested suburb .
the hutch and feeding and drinking bowls were there including a pile of sawdust , the guinea pig i caught and knew of someone who would care for it alongside other pets their very responsible children had .
the rabbit was afraid and ran off into the woods only to be discovered dead where it had been left , it had obviously gone back to its pal and the home it had known , it is so wrong to think by releasing domestic pets into a wild environment would be a kind thing to do , they would be lucky to last the first night .
duncan quick , york , north yorkshire .
many problems these days seem to be children thinking a rabbit is cute and fluffy and small , but they grow and require lots of attention , time and money -lrb- much like the children do ! -rrb- which kids these days can not deal with .
whilst rabbits are small and cute , they are n't cheap .
home visits should be carried out to ensure rabbits are kept in a suitable environment , much like with cats and dogs .
my sisters have not found caring for their rabbits to be a burden because of the joy that they bring , and it disgusts me to think that so many parents have such a flippant attitude towards their actions .
gemma , sheffield , uk rabbits are great pets , if you are prepared to care for them .
i have 2 rescue rabbits and everyone acknowledges they are mine and not the children 's .
the care involved is huge , as much as owning a large dog. they need daily hygiene , a minimum of 2 hours of exercise , play and entertainment , some need daily grooming and all rabbits need a varied diet including mixed fresh vegetables .
i have advised many friends that have asked about rabbit ownership to consider the amount of care involved before making any purchases , and i try to ensure they understand how many bunnies need rehoming before they look at the cute bundles of fluff in a pet shop .
sharron , chandlers ford , hampshire i have two rabbits and they are perfectly healthy .
you just have to see that they are living breathing animals that need your love and care .
you ca n't just say " i 'm not going to clean their hutch or let them out because i do n't feel like it . "
anonymous , can someone explain what gives a human being the right to turn wild animals into pets ?
and what exactly does keeping a pet teach a child ?
how about observing animals free and in their natural habitat instead ?
of course patient observing of nature requires more effort , more involvement , and more knowledge , from the parents .
it teaches a child -lrb- and her parents ! -rrb- how to observe , it encourages her to be inquisitive and to try to interpret and question what she observes .
it also teaches respect for animals and nature , and readily leads to other worthwhile activities or hobbies .
much healthier for everyone than keeping a pet in a cage i think .
any thought anyone ?
pascal , london i rescued my pet rabbit , she 'd had been locked in a cage 24/7 ..
she now has a happy life here with us , she lives in the house with us & makes a great little pet ..
how can people be so cruel ?
if you have a rabbit make sure the hutch is big enough & please please make sure they have a decent size run .. karen mills , wrexham i cant understand some people .
how hard is it to look after a rabbit ? we decided to get my son a rabbit and we got a northumberland dwarf as they do n't grow very big , a little tip for people with a medium sized cage , also we got a male as they are they are the less aggressive type , and he 's gorgeous. we keep him in a hutch and he is fed twice a day , twice a week he has a treat of fresh veg , when weather is not too bad we just let him run about for an hour and he loves and springs about , we recently had his nails clipped and the vet said he was very healthy , he now comes to you when you feed him and nuzzles your hand , and do you know what i find it ten times easier looking after our rabbit than keeping up with all the housework , so come on people , no excuses ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! julie , sheffield we took a rabbit from one of the national pet shop chains as he looked in poor condition and cowering in a corner .
our rabbit is still very timid , over 2 years on and he has had some severe health problems which means he can not live outside , he lives in our house now and has the free run of the house , in essence , he 's a house bunny .
if you are going to get a rabbit , ensure that you can look after them , they need food , water , fruit and veg every day , plus hay .
they need grooming , neutering and plenty of exercise and attention .
we adore our rabbit and he gives us so much pleasure but they do require a lot of love , care and attention .
rabbits give so much back but if you ca n't afford to give them the time they deserve , please do n't buy one and please do n't buy one as a christmas present .
iona pippen , caerphilly i have 3 rabbits .
to give them up or to abandon them is just not a option .
it is hard work looking after the hutches in winter but i still get out there when its cold and clean them and feed them .
in the summer i trim there nails and let them out for runs .
they are the nicest creatures ever .
a message for all readers , " do n't abandon them always ring the rspca and get them taken away with dignity " .
yasmine , rotherham animal cruelty still shocks me every time i hear it .
i myself have 2 rabbits , 2 guinea pigs & 2 hamsters and i love them all so much .
i was surprised of how much hard work looking after a rabbit it .
there about the same hard work as a dog. all animals need excersise and a good diet and love and attention of course. but rabbits have a very sensitive stomach , need at least 2 hours of love & and affection a day and of course need to be let out of there cage for a few hours at least !
the punishment for animal cruelty should be firmer. not just a slap on the hand ! katie hamlet , aberystwyth , wales yes , i 've rescued a rabbit and i 'm waiting to rescue my next one .
it 's terrible to read what 's happening as rabbits make fantastic pets .
all you need is a bit of space and then watch them run , jump and play .
they are so funny to watch but sticking them in a teeny weeny hutch does n't let children -lrb- and adults -rrb- see their full potential .
they 're more playful than adult cats for example .
if you want a rabbit get the biggest hutch you can and a large run and get in there with them - you 're kids will be soon like my 3 year old son - ca n't get enough !
sarah miles , worcestershire we found a rabbit in the gutter five years ago .
nobody claimed her so we kept her but she has cost a considerable amount of money in vet bills over that time .
as much as we like her , a rabbit would not be first on our list of pets .
to throw a rabbit into a hutch and think that that 's all the life it needs is just wrong and cruel , they need a lot more mental stimulation than that .
as for them being a good children 's pet , that 's a myth , children will grow bored of them quickly , and rabbits are more fragile than people believe , serious back injury not being uncommon if they fall or jump the wrong way .
they should not be a disposable commodity in this disposable society .
carol brown , adelaide australia we 've had rabbits in my family for years and we always get them for rspca rescue centres .
it 's beyond me why anyone would pay for one at a pet shop when there are so many who needs homes and might be put down if they do n't find one .
to buy a pet without realising what 's involved and that you might get bored of it is sheer idiocy .
get a rabbit because you have compassion towards animals and rabbits and want it to be part of your family .
do n't get it if you really ca n't be bothered to pay for it , clean its hutch or let it run around for a few hours a day .
it just causes suffering .
andrew , nottingham , uk as a vet with a large primary and referral caseload in rabbits i see this every day .
people get bored of the rabbits very quickly , and have n't researched the costs and keeping of their animals at all .
it 's sickening to think i only see the ones who are honourable enough to bring their animal to us and admit their failure .
if a rabbit is healthy we do what we can to rehome it but it 's a losing battle .
i regularly see rabbits living to 10 years old , some to 12 , and those are the lucky ones .
the second commonest cruelty cases i consult for the rspca are abandoned rabbits , and we investigate those thoroughly - those we catch are prosecuted .
it is heartbreaking to see animals just dumped in the middle of a park with no food or water simply because ignorant people got tired of taking care of them .
with housing facilities at breaking point we have to be ruthless about those we keep , and those we have to euthanase .
it 's disgraceful we 're put in that position by those who take on what they can not care for .
the estimate of costs for keeping a rabbit in the article is about right .
the other problem is people not feeding their rabbits properly .
hay .
grass .
hay .
grass .
that 's it .
perhaps a supplement if you want to .
" mixes " and so on will just end up in dental disease , and a lifetime of pain and discomfort , and a huge vets ' bill .
think before you buy .
william easson , cardiff , wales i was given a rabbit about 6 years ago as a gift .
to be honest in the first week i was n't sure if i wanted him as i knew nothing about rabbits and i was bit nervous if he would bite me and from the way he would sprint around the room so fast i just got put off and at night would put him back in the hutch .
six years later i still have him and would never give him away as he is so intelligent , fun and affectionate and crafty i sometimes forget his a rabbit from the way he behaves .
he is litter trained and when he knows i have been into the kitchen he comes sprinting towards me as he knows his getting a treat .
the bottom line is although rabbits are not like other animals and do n't really make noise they are very sociable animals and the more time you spend with them the end results are amazing .
just because they are quiet and not like a puppy or kitten that does n't mean people should abuse them in anyway as they are also very delicate animals .
i love my bunny so much i let him i sleep in a massive indoor cage that i purchased that has ramps and toys for him .
rabbits get very stressed easily and it is not right to keep them locked in their hutch for too long .
i strongly feel that people should not be allowed to purchase rabbits or any animal for that fact if they are going to think of it as a short term interest .
rabbits are hard work as i know how many times i clean his cage and feed him because its not humane to let them stay in a dirty cage .
jay jay has been a really nice experience for me that six years ago i would have laughed but if you give it a chance and spend time with your rabbit the rewards you get back are priceless .
liza fortes , sudbury uk i have 8 rabbits , 4 of which are rescues .
one was found running around our road and nobody ever claimed him .
i have had him for 4 years now .
even though i handle him every day and he has been castrated he is still aggressive and i doubt he will ever get over anything that happened to him before he came to me .
another was used to breed baby rabbits to be used as food for snakes .
she was pregnant when she came to me .
she killed all the babies .
think of the animal and not your children .
they do n't need a rabbit .
it wo n't teach them responsibility .
maybe if people stopped buying them the demand would n't be there and people would n't be irresponsibly breeding them .
break that circle. em , bristol , uk i got my two rabbits from greenwich rabbit rescue .
both were 3 month old minilops , from different homes .
after some unsettled and anxious behaviour like peeing on my lap , running away from pointing fingers or nipping and keeping jaws open , they are now almost docile .
they pretty much have the run of the house , and when it 's not too cold , run around the garden for a few hours .
there is daily hutch cleaning and feeding , but otherwise , they are happy to lounge and hop about .
i have no kids , so maybe that helps. martha rumian , london uk i have taken in 2 rabbits over the years which were unwanted pets .
i have also taken in budgies , hamsters , and a dog which were all unwanted .
it really annoys me that people do n't think long term about pets and are quick to dismiss them .
bring back licences - as anyone prepared to buy a licence will be prepared to look after a pet long term .
it is something that should be taught in school - the cost and effort that goes into owning a pet -lrb- babies as well -rrb- .
i only support animal charities , and being so soft over animals , people will always come to me first with any unwanted pets - and i ca n't say no .
my local paper often advertises pieces on animal care - could this be done nationally ?
paula flinders , nottinghamshire i found our rabbit in our garden on 4 jan 04 .
i had seen her around the neighbourhood , under parked cars and running through the bushes .
i caught her and brought her into our home .
this is where she stayed for nearly 2 years , as my house rabbit .
she was very easy to train , she had a hutch in the utility room which was always open , there was a litter tray next to the hutch .
the back door to the garden was always open so she could hop in and out when she felt like it and when the weather was fine , she even used to hop back in to use the litter tray .
i have three children from 18 down to 12 and they adored her but she was my rabbit when it came to feeding , cleaning and clipping nails .
they just gave her a name ; fubu .
i had to have her put down last christmas as she had arthritis in her back legs due to the bad diet and care she used to suffer from .
this was heartbreaking to watch in such a friendly animal but this is what happens when people do n't care enough about their pets . !
ellen plowman , chippenham wilts i " adopted " a rabbit nobody else wanted when i was a child .
i 'm now 51 .
i still remember him along with the cats and dogs i 've had since then .
i remember the love i felt for him , the unconsolable sadness i felt when he died .
the feelings generated by loving and caring for my pets and the responsibility involved are things that i 've tried to pass on to my children .
i 'm absolutely sure this has made us better people .
i now have three abandoned cats and an abandoned dog .
abandoning pets says something about who we are and the society we 've all " helped " to create .
none of us should ignore this fact .
liz brindley , baiona , spain rabbits are social animals and so need company .
if you are going to keep a rabbit outdoors in a hutch they should be kept in neutered / spayed pairs for company .
the best combination is a male and a female .
if kept on their own rabbits can become very depressed .
a hutch should be large enough for the rabbits to stand up on their back legs and have a permanently attached run for exercise .
if you are going to keep rabbits with enough attention to their welfare then please bear in mind that they are not cheap pets .
the initial set up costs for a pair of rabbits with a suitable hutch , vaccinations , neutering / spaying and food is around £ 600 .
if you are n't prepared to spend this sort of money then you really should n't buy them because to not provide all they need is cruel .
having said all that rabbits make excellent pets , we have two which actually live in the house and give us many hours of pleasure .
in case you are wondering they are very clean and are easily litter trained !
richard thacker , bristol i recently took on a rabbit that someone no longer wanted .
he was kept in a tiny hutch 24 hours a day and rarely had any water or adequate food .
he now has a 7ft enclosure and run of the garden when we are home .
i have bonded him with my female and they are totally happy .
rabbits are not kids pets .
they can be feisty , hard to hold when fully grown and territorial when not neutered .
only get a rabbit if an adult will ultimately be responsible for it .
kids can not be expected to take sole responsibility for one .
rabbits should not be kept alone , or with a guinea pig .
they should be neutered , vaccinated , have time spent with them , get regular daily exercise , a good diet including a supply of hay constantly , the list is endless .
please , please , do not buy a rabbit on a whim without giving it a lot of thought .
please also do not buy from a pet shop when there are so many animals in rescue .
kate , birmingham , west midlands in 1997 we found a french lop rabbit that had been dumped and she was most probably was an unwanted easter bunny that was bought for a kid who grew bored of her .
many parents sadly give in to temptation and buy rabbits as pets for their kids on the spare of the moment no thought in their future care etc , not meaning to be cruel but the children just lose interest after a while and therefore the poor bunny suffers , locked up in its cage or even has no food or water .
many cages are way to small that they sell in pet shops and the poor bunnies who once fitted in them as babies and then soon row soon outgrow their enclosures and therefore have no room to move .
thumper was lucky we rescued her and lived a very long and happy life estimated to be between 9-13 years old , many parents need to be aware of the costs rabbits can occur in their lifetime which can be 7years or more ! and also they need to be aware that they need vaccinating against deadly diseases such as vhd and myximotosis. lisa yates , manchester i am only 14 we 've had 1 rabbit loads of hamsters and 3 guinea pigs our guinea pigs have out lasted all the hamsters and 1 of our dogs .
they live a longer healthier life if you let them outside in summer and inside for a run about in winter they also receive fresh fruit and veg at night and are know over 12 years old zoe handley -lrb- 14 -rrb- , derby uk last week i saved two lionhead rabbits 1 girl and 1 boy they were about 3 month old , which were housed in a small bird cage , they were living in filthy conditions they had no food or clean water .
thy female rabbit was really skinny and had large amounts of matted fur around her rear end , it took 45 mins to cut it away. they are now both happy and healthy rabbits. i already have 4 rabbits of my own , and they are in healthy condition , they are let out of their hutches everyday from 7.00am-8.30-9.00pm -lrb- into a 16foot log cabin , with mesh windows -rrb- and are cleaned twice a week , they are also provided with fresh greens everyday , i also have live with two lovely rottweiller who play and clean the rabbits. i think that if people are thinking of owing rabbits they should do some research before hand , because its not as easy as it looks. victoria , bedfordshire e-mail this to a friend printable version video and audio news rabbits need a lot of social stimulation see also animal cases shock rspca officers 10 nov 06 -pipe- cornwall family rabbits stabbed to death 19 sep 06 -pipe- north east / n isles poorly rabbits dumped on roadside 22 aug 06 -pipe- coventry / warwickshire rspca criticises ' rabbit wedding ' 04 apr 06 -pipe- hereford / worcs crisis as pets breed like rabbits 20 feb 06 -pipe- lincolnshire related bbc links your pet rabbit related internet links rabbit welfare association rspca the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top uk stories ' outrage ' as deal ends bae probes mps vow to fight expenses charges teachers ' lack violence training ' most popular stories now most shared most read can the power of thought stop you ageing ?

the animal charity said a survey found that 70 % of rescued rabbits had been kept hutched 24 hours a day .
almost 40 % had had no food , and half had been living in filthy conditions , it told the bbc .
it found that people bought rabbits but then quickly lost interest .
on average the abandoned pets it came across had been dumped after just three months .
many were simply released in the street or into the wild .

they are so funny to watch but sticking them in a teeny weeny hutch does n't let children -lrb- and adults -rrb- see their full potential .
they 're more playful than adult cats for example .
if you want a rabbit get the biggest hutch you can and a large run and get in there with them - you 're kids will be soon like my 3 year old son - ca n't get enough !
sarah miles , worcestershire we found a rabbit in the gutter five years ago .
nobody claimed her so we kept her but she has cost a considerable amount of money in vet bills over that time .
as much as we like her , a rabbit would not be first on our list of pets .
to throw a rabbit into a hutch and think that that 's all the life it needs is just wrong and cruel , they need a lot more mental stimulation than that .
as for them being a good children 's pet , that 's a myth , children will grow bored of them quickly , and rabbits are more fragile than people believe , serious back injury not being uncommon if they fall or jump the wrong way .
they should not be a disposable commodity in this disposable society .
carol brown , adelaide australia we 've had rabbits in my family for years and we always get them for rspca rescue centres .
it 's beyond me why anyone would pay for one at a pet shop when there are so many who needs homes and might be put down if they do n't find one .
to buy a pet without realising what 's involved and that you might get bored of it is sheer idiocy .
get a rabbit because you have compassion towards animals and rabbits and want it to be part of your family .
do n't get it if you really ca n't be bothered to pay for it , clean its hutch or let it run around for a few hours a day .
it just causes suffering .
andrew , nottingham , uk as a vet with a large primary and referral caseload in rabbits i see this every day .
people get bored of the rabbits very quickly , and have n't researched the costs and keeping of their animals at all .
it 's sickening to think i only see the ones who are honourable enough to bring their animal to us and admit their failure .
if a rabbit is healthy we do what we can to rehome it but it 's a losing battle .
i regularly see rabbits living to 10 years old , some to 12 , and those are the lucky ones .
the second commonest cruelty cases i consult for the rspca are abandoned rabbits , and we investigate those thoroughly - those we catch are prosecuted .
it is heartbreaking to see animals just dumped in the middle of a park with no food or water simply because ignorant people got tired of taking care of them .
with housing facilities at breaking point we have to be ruthless about those we keep , and those we have to euthanase .
it 's disgraceful we 're put in that position by those who take on what they can not care for .
the estimate of costs for keeping a rabbit in the article is about right .
the other problem is people not feeding their rabbits properly .

william easson , cardiff , wales i was given a rabbit about 6 years ago as a gift .
to be honest in the first week i was n't sure if i wanted him as i knew nothing about rabbits and i was bit nervous if he would bite me and from the way he would sprint around the room so fast i just got put off and at night would put him back in the hutch .
six years later i still have him and would never give him away as he is so intelligent , fun and affectionate and crafty i sometimes forget his a rabbit from the way he behaves .
he is litter trained and when he knows i have been into the kitchen he comes sprinting towards me as he knows his getting a treat .
the bottom line is although rabbits are not like other animals and do n't really make noise they are very sociable animals and the more time you spend with them the end results are amazing .
just because they are quiet and not like a puppy or kitten that does n't mean people should abuse them in anyway as they are also very delicate animals .
i love my bunny so much i let him i sleep in a massive indoor cage that i purchased that has ramps and toys for him .
rabbits get very stressed easily and it is not right to keep them locked in their hutch for too long .
i strongly feel that people should not be allowed to purchase rabbits or any animal for that fact if they are going to think of it as a short term interest .
rabbits are hard work as i know how many times i clean his cage and feed him because its not humane to let them stay in a dirty cage .
jay jay has been a really nice experience for me that six years ago i would have laughed but if you give it a chance and spend time with your rabbit the rewards you get back are priceless .
liza fortes , sudbury uk i have 8 rabbits , 4 of which are rescues .
one was found running around our road and nobody ever claimed him .
i have had him for 4 years now .
even though i handle him every day and he has been castrated he is still aggressive and i doubt he will ever get over anything that happened to him before he came to me .
another was used to breed baby rabbits to be used as food for snakes .
she was pregnant when she came to me .
she killed all the babies .
think of the animal and not your children .
they do n't need a rabbit .
it wo n't teach them responsibility .
maybe if people stopped buying them the demand would n't be there and people would n't be irresponsibly breeding them .
break that circle. em , bristol , uk i got my two rabbits from greenwich rabbit rescue .
both were 3 month old minilops , from different homes .
after some unsettled and anxious behaviour like peeing on my lap , running away from pointing fingers or nipping and keeping jaws open , they are now almost docile .
they pretty much have the run of the house , and when it 's not too cold , run around the garden for a few hours .
there is daily hutch cleaning and feeding , but otherwise , they are happy to lounge and hop about .
i have no kids , so maybe that helps. martha rumian , london uk i have taken in 2 rabbits over the years which were unwanted pets .
i have also taken in budgies , hamsters , and a dog which were all unwanted .
it really annoys me that people do n't think long term about pets and are quick to dismiss them .
bring back licences - as anyone prepared to buy a licence will be prepared to look after a pet long term .
it is something that should be taught in school - the cost and effort that goes into owning a pet -lrb- babies as well -rrb- .
i only support animal charities , and being so soft over animals , people will always come to me first with any unwanted pets - and i ca n't say no .
my local paper often advertises pieces on animal care - could this be done nationally ?
paula flinders , nottinghamshire i found our rabbit in our garden on 4 jan 04 .
i had seen her around the neighbourhood , under parked cars and running through the bushes .
i caught her and brought her into our home .
this is where she stayed for nearly 2 years , as my house rabbit .
she was very easy to train , she had a hutch in the utility room which was always open , there was a litter tray next to the hutch .
the back door to the garden was always open so she could hop in and out when she felt like it and when the weather was fine , she even used to hop back in to use the litter tray .
i have three children from 18 down to 12 and they adored her but she was my rabbit when it came to feeding , cleaning and clipping nails .
they just gave her a name ; fubu .
i had to have her put down last christmas as she had arthritis in her back legs due to the bad diet and care she used to suffer from .
this was heartbreaking to watch in such a friendly animal but this is what happens when people do n't care enough about their pets . !
ellen plowman , chippenham wilts i " adopted " a rabbit nobody else wanted when i was a child .
i 'm now 51 .
i still remember him along with the cats and dogs i 've had since then .
i remember the love i felt for him , the unconsolable sadness i felt when he died .
the feelings generated by loving and caring for my pets and the responsibility involved are things that i 've tried to pass on to my children .
i 'm absolutely sure this has made us better people .
i now have three abandoned cats and an abandoned dog .
abandoning pets says something about who we are and the society we 've all " helped " to create .
none of us should ignore this fact .
liz brindley , baiona , spain rabbits are social animals and so need company .
if you are going to keep a rabbit outdoors in a hutch they should be kept in neutered / spayed pairs for company .
the best combination is a male and a female .
if kept on their own rabbits can become very depressed .
a hutch should be large enough for the rabbits to stand up on their back legs and have a permanently attached run for exercise .
if you are going to keep rabbits with enough attention to their welfare then please bear in mind that they are not cheap pets .
the initial set up costs for a pair of rabbits with a suitable hutch , vaccinations , neutering / spaying and food is around £ 600 .
if you are n't prepared to spend this sort of money then you really should n't buy them because to not provide all they need is cruel .
having said all that rabbits make excellent pets , we have two which actually live in the house and give us many hours of pleasure .
in case you are wondering they are very clean and are easily litter trained !
richard thacker , bristol i recently took on a rabbit that someone no longer wanted .
he was kept in a tiny hutch 24 hours a day and rarely had any water or adequate food .
he now has a 7ft enclosure and run of the garden when we are home .
i have bonded him with my female and they are totally happy .
rabbits are not kids pets .
they can be feisty , hard to hold when fully grown and territorial when not neutered .
only get a rabbit if an adult will ultimately be responsible for it .
kids can not be expected to take sole responsibility for one .
rabbits should not be kept alone , or with a guinea pig .
they should be neutered , vaccinated , have time spent with them , get regular daily exercise , a good diet including a supply of hay constantly , the list is endless .
please , please , do not buy a rabbit on a whim without giving it a lot of thought .
please also do not buy from a pet shop when there are so many animals in rescue .
kate , birmingham , west midlands in 1997 we found a french lop rabbit that had been dumped and she was most probably was an unwanted easter bunny that was bought for a kid who grew bored of her .
many parents sadly give in to temptation and buy rabbits as pets for their kids on the spare of the moment no thought in their future care etc , not meaning to be cruel but the children just lose interest after a while and therefore the poor bunny suffers , locked up in its cage or even has no food or water .
many cages are way to small that they sell in pet shops and the poor bunnies who once fitted in them as babies and then soon row soon outgrow their enclosures and therefore have no room to move .
thumper was lucky we rescued her and lived a very long and happy life estimated to be between 9-13 years old , many parents need to be aware of the costs rabbits can occur in their lifetime which can be 7years or more ! and also they need to be aware that they need vaccinating against deadly diseases such as vhd and myximotosis. lisa yates , manchester i am only 14 we 've had 1 rabbit loads of hamsters and 3 guinea pigs our guinea pigs have out lasted all the hamsters and 1 of our dogs .
they live a longer healthier life if you let them outside in summer and inside for a run about in winter they also receive fresh fruit and veg at night and are know over 12 years old zoe handley -lrb- 14 -rrb- , derby uk last week i saved two lionhead rabbits 1 girl and 1 boy they were about 3 month old , which were housed in a small bird cage , they were living in filthy conditions they had no food or clean water .
thy female rabbit was really skinny and had large amounts of matted fur around her rear end , it took 45 mins to cut it away. they are now both happy and healthy rabbits. i already have 4 rabbits of my own , and they are in healthy condition , they are let out of their hutches everyday from 7.00am-8.30-9.00pm -lrb- into a 16foot log cabin , with mesh windows -rrb- and are cleaned twice a week , they are also provided with fresh greens everyday , i also have live with two lovely rottweiller who play and clean the rabbits. i think that if people are thinking of owing rabbits they should do some research before hand , because its not as easy as it looks. victoria , bedfordshire e-mail this to a friend printable version video and audio news rabbits need a lot of social stimulation see also animal cases shock rspca officers 10 nov 06 -pipe- cornwall family rabbits stabbed to death 19 sep 06 -pipe- north east / n isles poorly rabbits dumped on roadside 22 aug 06 -pipe- coventry / warwickshire rspca criticises ' rabbit wedding ' 04 apr 06 -pipe- hereford / worcs crisis as pets breed like rabbits 20 feb 06 -pipe- lincolnshire related bbc links your pet rabbit related internet links rabbit welfare association rspca the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top uk stories major manhunt for afghan soldier unemployment dips to 2.47 million pm condemns sympathy for moat most popular stories now most shared most read nairobi bikers improve their own slum most popular now , in detail most shared most read diana dors sports car to be sold rise of the mamils -lrb- middle-aged men in lycra -rrb- ' four dead ' in ny state shooting obama backs ' ground zero mosque ' iraqi asylum seekers struggle to survive in sweden sun 's ' quiet period ' explained pakistan says 20m hit by floods children hurt in lurgan explosion lebanon opens fund to equip army passengers hurt as coaches crash most popular now , in detail features , views , analysis planning an exit attacks by afghan soldiers pose nato problems sanction evasion ?

the animal charity said a survey found that 70 % of rescued rabbits had been kept hutched 24 hours a day .
almost 40 % had had no food , and half had been living in filthy conditions , it told the bbc .
it found that people bought rabbits but then quickly lost interest .
on average the abandoned pets it came across had been dumped after just three months .
many were simply released in the street or into the wild .
responsibility rabbits are the third most popular pet after cats and dogs and the rspca says that rescue centres are struggling to cope with the 35,000 unwanted pets abandoned every year .
if you did n't have the children , would you be keen to have the rabbit ?
anne mitchell , rabbit welfare association send us your comments anne mitchell from the rabbit welfare association warned that parents needed to realise the responsibilities that go with caring for rabbits .
the animals can live for up to eight years and cost £ 4,000 over their lifetime .
" if you did n't have the children , would you be keen to have the rabbit ?
if you would n't , do n't do it , " she said .
" ninety percent of children get bored , they 're tired very quickly of the chores .
" you ca n't treat it like barbie doll and action man and just stuff it in the cupboard under the stairs , although sadly some of these rabbits do end up like that , totally neglected . "
the rspca statistics will be released next week as part of a survey into rabbit welfare .
here are some of your comments : i think the estimate of £ 4k to keep a rabbit is a little on the high side .
like with any pet , you should always make sure you have a contingency fund for treating any unforeseen illness , but pellets , hay , treats and veg for my house bunny cost no more than £ 20 per month .
it 's a shame to think of people deciding against rescuing a rabbit because of the expense .
i 'm sure most spend twice that on their mobile phone bills !
shona , glasgow about 15 years ago my neighbours were moving and had a rabbit which had lost most of it 's hair due to alopecia they tried to persuade me to have the rabbit so i rang my sister who had young children she gave a home to the rabbit and after a couple of visits to the vet all it 's hair came back and it lived several years happily until it was killed by a fox -lrb- in fulham of all places -rrb- charlie mortimer , london , uk my family has had three rabbits over the years , and the latest one is a rescue .
she was obviously abused , because even after 6 years , she still bites and growls and lunges at us on occasion and is very difficult to pick up for a cuddle .
however , she can also be incredibly sweet , and once she is picked up , nuzzles and snuggles like any of our other rabbits did .
she is inquisitive and incredibly bright for a rabbit , and has often been known to play games with us .
yet she was abused , or at least neglected -lrb- which is of course just a form of abuse -rrb- .
taking care of rabbits is n't that difficult .
it requires dedication and work , just as owning any other animal does .
people need to be sure they have 8-15 years to dedicate to caring for a rabbit before they buy one - they are much longer lived than most realize .
amanda , norwich , uk i discovered not only a guinea pig and a lop eared rabbit what must have been hours after being dumped in the middle of a heavily forested suburb .
the hutch and feeding and drinking bowls were there including a pile of sawdust , the guinea pig i caught and knew of someone who would care for it alongside other pets their very responsible children had .
the rabbit was afraid and ran off into the woods only to be discovered dead where it had been left , it had obviously gone back to its pal and the home it had known , it is so wrong to think by releasing domestic pets into a wild environment would be a kind thing to do , they would be lucky to last the first night .
duncan quick , york , north yorkshire .
many problems these days seem to be children thinking a rabbit is cute and fluffy and small , but they grow and require lots of attention , time and money -lrb- much like the children do ! -rrb- which kids these days can not deal with .
whilst rabbits are small and cute , they are n't cheap .
home visits should be carried out to ensure rabbits are kept in a suitable environment , much like with cats and dogs .
my sisters have not found caring for their rabbits to be a burden because of the joy that they bring , and it disgusts me to think that so many parents have such a flippant attitude towards their actions .
gemma , sheffield , uk rabbits are great pets , if you are prepared to care for them .
i have 2 rescue rabbits and everyone acknowledges they are mine and not the children 's .
the care involved is huge , as much as owning a large dog. they need daily hygiene , a minimum of 2 hours of exercise , play and entertainment , some need daily grooming and all rabbits need a varied diet including mixed fresh vegetables .
i have advised many friends that have asked about rabbit ownership to consider the amount of care involved before making any purchases , and i try to ensure they understand how many bunnies need rehoming before they look at the cute bundles of fluff in a pet shop .
sharron , chandlers ford , hampshire i have two rabbits and they are perfectly healthy .
you just have to see that they are living breathing animals that need your love and care .
you ca n't just say " i 'm not going to clean their hutch or let them out because i do n't feel like it . "
anonymous , can someone explain what gives a human being the right to turn wild animals into pets ?
and what exactly does keeping a pet teach a child ?
how about observing animals free and in their natural habitat instead ?
of course patient observing of nature requires more effort , more involvement , and more knowledge , from the parents .
it teaches a child -lrb- and her parents ! -rrb- how to observe , it encourages her to be inquisitive and to try to interpret and question what she observes .
it also teaches respect for animals and nature , and readily leads to other worthwhile activities or hobbies .
much healthier for everyone than keeping a pet in a cage i think .
any thought anyone ?
pascal , london i rescued my pet rabbit , she 'd had been locked in a cage 24/7 ..
she now has a happy life here with us , she lives in the house with us & makes a great little pet ..
how can people be so cruel ?
if you have a rabbit make sure the hutch is big enough & please please make sure they have a decent size run .. karen mills , wrexham i cant understand some people .
how hard is it to look after a rabbit ? we decided to get my son a rabbit and we got a northumberland dwarf as they do n't grow very big , a little tip for people with a medium sized cage , also we got a male as they are they are the less aggressive type , and he 's gorgeous. we keep him in a hutch and he is fed twice a day , twice a week he has a treat of fresh veg , when weather is not too bad we just let him run about for an hour and he loves and springs about , we recently had his nails clipped and the vet said he was very healthy , he now comes to you when you feed him and nuzzles your hand , and do you know what i find it ten times easier looking after our rabbit than keeping up with all the housework , so come on people , no excuses ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! julie , sheffield we took a rabbit from one of the national pet shop chains as he looked in poor condition and cowering in a corner .
our rabbit is still very timid , over 2 years on and he has had some severe health problems which means he can not live outside , he lives in our house now and has the free run of the house , in essence , he 's a house bunny .
if you are going to get a rabbit , ensure that you can look after them , they need food , water , fruit and veg every day , plus hay .
they need grooming , neutering and plenty of exercise and attention .
we adore our rabbit and he gives us so much pleasure but they do require a lot of love , care and attention .
rabbits give so much back but if you ca n't afford to give them the time they deserve , please do n't buy one and please do n't buy one as a christmas present .
iona pippen , caerphilly i have 3 rabbits .
to give them up or to abandon them is just not a option .
it is hard work looking after the hutches in winter but i still get out there when its cold and clean them and feed them .
in the summer i trim there nails and let them out for runs .
they are the nicest creatures ever .
a message for all readers , " do n't abandon them always ring the rspca and get them taken away with dignity " .
yasmine , rotherham animal cruelty still shocks me every time i hear it .
i myself have 2 rabbits , 2 guinea pigs & 2 hamsters and i love them all so much .
i was surprised of how much hard work looking after a rabbit it .
there about the same hard work as a dog. all animals need excersise and a good diet and love and attention of course. but rabbits have a very sensitive stomach , need at least 2 hours of love & and affection a day and of course need to be let out of there cage for a few hours at least !
the punishment for animal cruelty should be firmer. not just a slap on the hand ! katie hamlet , aberystwyth , wales yes , i 've rescued a rabbit and i 'm waiting to rescue my next one .

the best combination is a male and a female .
if kept on their own rabbits can become very depressed .
a hutch should be large enough for the rabbits to stand up on their back legs and have a permanently attached run for exercise .
if you are going to keep rabbits with enough attention to their welfare then please bear in mind that they are not cheap pets .
the initial set up costs for a pair of rabbits with a suitable hutch , vaccinations , neutering / spaying and food is around £ 600 .
if you are n't prepared to spend this sort of money then you really should n't buy them because to not provide all they need is cruel .
having said all that rabbits make excellent pets , we have two which actually live in the house and give us many hours of pleasure .
in case you are wondering they are very clean and are easily litter trained !
richard thacker , bristol i recently took on a rabbit that someone no longer wanted .
he was kept in a tiny hutch 24 hours a day and rarely had any water or adequate food .
he now has a 7ft enclosure and run of the garden when we are home .
i have bonded him with my female and they are totally happy .
rabbits are not kids pets .
they can be feisty , hard to hold when fully grown and territorial when not neutered .
only get a rabbit if an adult will ultimately be responsible for it .
kids can not be expected to take sole responsibility for one .
rabbits should not be kept alone , or with a guinea pig .
they should be neutered , vaccinated , have time spent with them , get regular daily exercise , a good diet including a supply of hay constantly , the list is endless .
please , please , do not buy a rabbit on a whim without giving it a lot of thought .
please also do not buy from a pet shop when there are so many animals in rescue .
kate , birmingham , west midlands in 1997 we found a french lop rabbit that had been dumped and she was most probably was an unwanted easter bunny that was bought for a kid who grew bored of her .
many parents sadly give in to temptation and buy rabbits as pets for their kids on the spare of the moment no thought in their future care etc , not meaning to be cruel but the children just lose interest after a while and therefore the poor bunny suffers , locked up in its cage or even has no food or water .
many cages are way to small that they sell in pet shops and the poor bunnies who once fitted in them as babies and then soon row soon outgrow their enclosures and therefore have no room to move .
thumper was lucky we rescued her and lived a very long and happy life estimated to be between 9-13 years old , many parents need to be aware of the costs rabbits can occur in their lifetime which can be 7years or more ! and also they need to be aware that they need vaccinating against deadly diseases such as vhd and myximotosis. lisa yates , manchester i am only 14 we 've had 1 rabbit loads of hamsters and 3 guinea pigs our guinea pigs have out lasted all the hamsters and 1 of our dogs .

the animal charity said a survey found that 70 % of rescued rabbits had been kept hutched 24 hours a day .
almost 40 % had had no food , and half had been living in filthy conditions , it told the bbc .
it found that people bought rabbits but then quickly lost interest .
on average the abandoned pets it came across had been dumped after just three months .
many were simply released in the street or into the wild .
responsibility rabbits are the third most popular pet after cats and dogs and the rspca says that rescue centres are struggling to cope with the 35,000 unwanted pets abandoned every year .
if you did n't have the children , would you be keen to have the rabbit ?
anne mitchell , rabbit welfare association send us your comments anne mitchell from the rabbit welfare association warned that parents needed to realise the responsibilities that go with caring for rabbits .
the animals can live for up to eight years and cost £ 4,000 over their lifetime .
" if you did n't have the children , would you be keen to have the rabbit ?
if you would n't , do n't do it , " she said .
" ninety percent of children get bored , they 're tired very quickly of the chores .
" you ca n't treat it like barbie doll and action man and just stuff it in the cupboard under the stairs , although sadly some of these rabbits do end up like that , totally neglected . "
the rspca statistics will be released next week as part of a survey into rabbit welfare .
here are some of your comments : i think the estimate of £ 4k to keep a rabbit is a little on the high side .
like with any pet , you should always make sure you have a contingency fund for treating any unforeseen illness , but pellets , hay , treats and veg for my house bunny cost no more than £ 20 per month .
it 's a shame to think of people deciding against rescuing a rabbit because of the expense .
i 'm sure most spend twice that on their mobile phone bills !
shona , glasgow about 15 years ago my neighbours were moving and had a rabbit which had lost most of it 's hair due to alopecia they tried to persuade me to have the rabbit so i rang my sister who had young children she gave a home to the rabbit and after a couple of visits to the vet all it 's hair came back and it lived several years happily until it was killed by a fox -lrb- in fulham of all places -rrb- charlie mortimer , london , uk my family has had three rabbits over the years , and the latest one is a rescue .
she was obviously abused , because even after 6 years , she still bites and growls and lunges at us on occasion and is very difficult to pick up for a cuddle .
however , she can also be incredibly sweet , and once she is picked up , nuzzles and snuggles like any of our other rabbits did .
she is inquisitive and incredibly bright for a rabbit , and has often been known to play games with us .
yet she was abused , or at least neglected -lrb- which is of course just a form of abuse -rrb- .
taking care of rabbits is n't that difficult .
it requires dedication and work , just as owning any other animal does .
people need to be sure they have 8-15 years to dedicate to caring for a rabbit before they buy one - they are much longer lived than most realize .
amanda , norwich , uk i discovered not only a guinea pig and a lop eared rabbit what must have been hours after being dumped in the middle of a heavily forested suburb .
the hutch and feeding and drinking bowls were there including a pile of sawdust , the guinea pig i caught and knew of someone who would care for it alongside other pets their very responsible children had .
the rabbit was afraid and ran off into the woods only to be discovered dead where it had been left , it had obviously gone back to its pal and the home it had known , it is so wrong to think by releasing domestic pets into a wild environment would be a kind thing to do , they would be lucky to last the first night .
duncan quick , york , north yorkshire .
many problems these days seem to be children thinking a rabbit is cute and fluffy and small , but they grow and require lots of attention , time and money -lrb- much like the children do ! -rrb- which kids these days can not deal with .
whilst rabbits are small and cute , they are n't cheap .
home visits should be carried out to ensure rabbits are kept in a suitable environment , much like with cats and dogs .
my sisters have not found caring for their rabbits to be a burden because of the joy that they bring , and it disgusts me to think that so many parents have such a flippant attitude towards their actions .
gemma , sheffield , uk rabbits are great pets , if you are prepared to care for them .
i have 2 rescue rabbits and everyone acknowledges they are mine and not the children 's .
the care involved is huge , as much as owning a large dog. they need daily hygiene , a minimum of 2 hours of exercise , play and entertainment , some need daily grooming and all rabbits need a varied diet including mixed fresh vegetables .
i have advised many friends that have asked about rabbit ownership to consider the amount of care involved before making any purchases , and i try to ensure they understand how many bunnies need rehoming before they look at the cute bundles of fluff in a pet shop .
sharron , chandlers ford , hampshire i have two rabbits and they are perfectly healthy .
you just have to see that they are living breathing animals that need your love and care .
you ca n't just say " i 'm not going to clean their hutch or let them out because i do n't feel like it . "
anonymous , can someone explain what gives a human being the right to turn wild animals into pets ?
and what exactly does keeping a pet teach a child ?
how about observing animals free and in their natural habitat instead ?
of course patient observing of nature requires more effort , more involvement , and more knowledge , from the parents .
it teaches a child -lrb- and her parents ! -rrb- how to observe , it encourages her to be inquisitive and to try to interpret and question what she observes .
it also teaches respect for animals and nature , and readily leads to other worthwhile activities or hobbies .
much healthier for everyone than keeping a pet in a cage i think .
any thought anyone ?
pascal , london i rescued my pet rabbit , she 'd had been locked in a cage 24/7 ..
she now has a happy life here with us , she lives in the house with us & makes a great little pet ..
how can people be so cruel ?
if you have a rabbit make sure the hutch is big enough & please please make sure they have a decent size run .. karen mills , wrexham i cant understand some people .
how hard is it to look after a rabbit ? we decided to get my son a rabbit and we got a northumberland dwarf as they do n't grow very big , a little tip for people with a medium sized cage , also we got a male as they are they are the less aggressive type , and he 's gorgeous. we keep him in a hutch and he is fed twice a day , twice a week he has a treat of fresh veg , when weather is not too bad we just let him run about for an hour and he loves and springs about , we recently had his nails clipped and the vet said he was very healthy , he now comes to you when you feed him and nuzzles your hand , and do you know what i find it ten times easier looking after our rabbit than keeping up with all the housework , so come on people , no excuses ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! julie , sheffield we took a rabbit from one of the national pet shop chains as he looked in poor condition and cowering in a corner .
our rabbit is still very timid , over 2 years on and he has had some severe health problems which means he can not live outside , he lives in our house now and has the free run of the house , in essence , he 's a house bunny .
if you are going to get a rabbit , ensure that you can look after them , they need food , water , fruit and veg every day , plus hay .
they need grooming , neutering and plenty of exercise and attention .
we adore our rabbit and he gives us so much pleasure but they do require a lot of love , care and attention .
rabbits give so much back but if you ca n't afford to give them the time they deserve , please do n't buy one and please do n't buy one as a christmas present .
iona pippen , caerphilly i have 3 rabbits .
to give them up or to abandon them is just not a option .
it is hard work looking after the hutches in winter but i still get out there when its cold and clean them and feed them .
in the summer i trim there nails and let them out for runs .
they are the nicest creatures ever .
a message for all readers , " do n't abandon them always ring the rspca and get them taken away with dignity " .
yasmine , rotherham animal cruelty still shocks me every time i hear it .
i myself have 2 rabbits , 2 guinea pigs & 2 hamsters and i love them all so much .
i was surprised of how much hard work looking after a rabbit it .
there about the same hard work as a dog. all animals need excersise and a good diet and love and attention of course. but rabbits have a very sensitive stomach , need at least 2 hours of love & and affection a day and of course need to be let out of there cage for a few hours at least !
the punishment for animal cruelty should be firmer. not just a slap on the hand ! katie hamlet , aberystwyth , wales yes , i 've rescued a rabbit and i 'm waiting to rescue my next one .
it 's terrible to read what 's happening as rabbits make fantastic pets .
all you need is a bit of space and then watch them run , jump and play .
they are so funny to watch but sticking them in a teeny weeny hutch does n't let children -lrb- and adults -rrb- see their full potential .
they 're more playful than adult cats for example .
if you want a rabbit get the biggest hutch you can and a large run and get in there with them - you 're kids will be soon like my 3 year old son - ca n't get enough !
sarah miles , worcestershire we found a rabbit in the gutter five years ago .
nobody claimed her so we kept her but she has cost a considerable amount of money in vet bills over that time .
as much as we like her , a rabbit would not be first on our list of pets .
to throw a rabbit into a hutch and think that that 's all the life it needs is just wrong and cruel , they need a lot more mental stimulation than that .
as for them being a good children 's pet , that 's a myth , children will grow bored of them quickly , and rabbits are more fragile than people believe , serious back injury not being uncommon if they fall or jump the wrong way .
they should not be a disposable commodity in this disposable society .
carol brown , adelaide australia we 've had rabbits in my family for years and we always get them for rspca rescue centres .
it 's beyond me why anyone would pay for one at a pet shop when there are so many who needs homes and might be put down if they do n't find one .
to buy a pet without realising what 's involved and that you might get bored of it is sheer idiocy .
get a rabbit because you have compassion towards animals and rabbits and want it to be part of your family .
do n't get it if you really ca n't be bothered to pay for it , clean its hutch or let it run around for a few hours a day .
it just causes suffering .
andrew , nottingham , uk as a vet with a large primary and referral caseload in rabbits i see this every day .
people get bored of the rabbits very quickly , and have n't researched the costs and keeping of their animals at all .
it 's sickening to think i only see the ones who are honourable enough to bring their animal to us and admit their failure .
if a rabbit is healthy we do what we can to rehome it but it 's a losing battle .
i regularly see rabbits living to 10 years old , some to 12 , and those are the lucky ones .
the second commonest cruelty cases i consult for the rspca are abandoned rabbits , and we investigate those thoroughly - those we catch are prosecuted .
it is heartbreaking to see animals just dumped in the middle of a park with no food or water simply because ignorant people got tired of taking care of them .
with housing facilities at breaking point we have to be ruthless about those we keep , and those we have to euthanase .
it 's disgraceful we 're put in that position by those who take on what they can not care for .
the estimate of costs for keeping a rabbit in the article is about right .
the other problem is people not feeding their rabbits properly .
hay .
grass .
hay .
grass .
that 's it .
perhaps a supplement if you want to .
" mixes " and so on will just end up in dental disease , and a lifetime of pain and discomfort , and a huge vets ' bill .
think before you buy .
william easson , cardiff , wales i was given a rabbit about 6 years ago as a gift .
to be honest in the first week i was n't sure if i wanted him as i knew nothing about rabbits and i was bit nervous if he would bite me and from the way he would sprint around the room so fast i just got put off and at night would put him back in the hutch .
six years later i still have him and would never give him away as he is so intelligent , fun and affectionate and crafty i sometimes forget his a rabbit from the way he behaves .
he is litter trained and when he knows i have been into the kitchen he comes sprinting towards me as he knows his getting a treat .
the bottom line is although rabbits are not like other animals and do n't really make noise they are very sociable animals and the more time you spend with them the end results are amazing .
just because they are quiet and not like a puppy or kitten that does n't mean people should abuse them in anyway as they are also very delicate animals .
i love my bunny so much i let him i sleep in a massive indoor cage that i purchased that has ramps and toys for him .
rabbits get very stressed easily and it is not right to keep them locked in their hutch for too long .
i strongly feel that people should not be allowed to purchase rabbits or any animal for that fact if they are going to think of it as a short term interest .
rabbits are hard work as i know how many times i clean his cage and feed him because its not humane to let them stay in a dirty cage .
jay jay has been a really nice experience for me that six years ago i would have laughed but if you give it a chance and spend time with your rabbit the rewards you get back are priceless .
liza fortes , sudbury uk i have 8 rabbits , 4 of which are rescues .
one was found running around our road and nobody ever claimed him .
i have had him for 4 years now .
even though i handle him every day and he has been castrated he is still aggressive and i doubt he will ever get over anything that happened to him before he came to me .
another was used to breed baby rabbits to be used as food for snakes .
she was pregnant when she came to me .
she killed all the babies .
think of the animal and not your children .
they do n't need a rabbit .
it wo n't teach them responsibility .
maybe if people stopped buying them the demand would n't be there and people would n't be irresponsibly breeding them .
break that circle. em , bristol , uk i got my two rabbits from greenwich rabbit rescue .
both were 3 month old minilops , from different homes .
after some unsettled and anxious behaviour like peeing on my lap , running away from pointing fingers or nipping and keeping jaws open , they are now almost docile .
they pretty much have the run of the house , and when it 's not too cold , run around the garden for a few hours .
there is daily hutch cleaning and feeding , but otherwise , they are happy to lounge and hop about .
i have no kids , so maybe that helps. martha rumian , london uk i have taken in 2 rabbits over the years which were unwanted pets .
i have also taken in budgies , hamsters , and a dog which were all unwanted .
it really annoys me that people do n't think long term about pets and are quick to dismiss them .
bring back licences - as anyone prepared to buy a licence will be prepared to look after a pet long term .
it is something that should be taught in school - the cost and effort that goes into owning a pet -lrb- babies as well -rrb- .
i only support animal charities , and being so soft over animals , people will always come to me first with any unwanted pets - and i ca n't say no .
my local paper often advertises pieces on animal care - could this be done nationally ?
paula flinders , nottinghamshire i found our rabbit in our garden on 4 jan 04 .
i had seen her around the neighbourhood , under parked cars and running through the bushes .
i caught her and brought her into our home .
this is where she stayed for nearly 2 years , as my house rabbit .
she was very easy to train , she had a hutch in the utility room which was always open , there was a litter tray next to the hutch .
the back door to the garden was always open so she could hop in and out when she felt like it and when the weather was fine , she even used to hop back in to use the litter tray .
i have three children from 18 down to 12 and they adored her but she was my rabbit when it came to feeding , cleaning and clipping nails .
they just gave her a name ; fubu .
i had to have her put down last christmas as she had arthritis in her back legs due to the bad diet and care she used to suffer from .
this was heartbreaking to watch in such a friendly animal but this is what happens when people do n't care enough about their pets . !
ellen plowman , chippenham wilts i " adopted " a rabbit nobody else wanted when i was a child .
i 'm now 51 .
i still remember him along with the cats and dogs i 've had since then .
i remember the love i felt for him , the unconsolable sadness i felt when he died .
the feelings generated by loving and caring for my pets and the responsibility involved are things that i 've tried to pass on to my children .
i 'm absolutely sure this has made us better people .
i now have three abandoned cats and an abandoned dog .
abandoning pets says something about who we are and the society we 've all " helped " to create .
none of us should ignore this fact .

shona , glasgow about 15 years ago my neighbours were moving and had a rabbit which had lost most of it 's hair due to alopecia they tried to persuade me to have the rabbit so i rang my sister who had young children she gave a home to the rabbit and after a couple of visits to the vet all it 's hair came back and it lived several years happily until it was killed by a fox -lrb- in fulham of all places -rrb- charlie mortimer , london , uk my family has had three rabbits over the years , and the latest one is a rescue .
she was obviously abused , because even after 6 years , she still bites and growls and lunges at us on occasion and is very difficult to pick up for a cuddle .
however , she can also be incredibly sweet , and once she is picked up , nuzzles and snuggles like any of our other rabbits did .
she is inquisitive and incredibly bright for a rabbit , and has often been known to play games with us .
yet she was abused , or at least neglected -lrb- which is of course just a form of abuse -rrb- .
taking care of rabbits is n't that difficult .
it requires dedication and work , just as owning any other animal does .
people need to be sure they have 8-15 years to dedicate to caring for a rabbit before they buy one - they are much longer lived than most realize .
amanda , norwich , uk i discovered not only a guinea pig and a lop eared rabbit what must have been hours after being dumped in the middle of a heavily forested suburb .
the hutch and feeding and drinking bowls were there including a pile of sawdust , the guinea pig i caught and knew of someone who would care for it alongside other pets their very responsible children had .
the rabbit was afraid and ran off into the woods only to be discovered dead where it had been left , it had obviously gone back to its pal and the home it had known , it is so wrong to think by releasing domestic pets into a wild environment would be a kind thing to do , they would be lucky to last the first night .
duncan quick , york , north yorkshire .
many problems these days seem to be children thinking a rabbit is cute and fluffy and small , but they grow and require lots of attention , time and money -lrb- much like the children do ! -rrb- which kids these days can not deal with .
whilst rabbits are small and cute , they are n't cheap .
home visits should be carried out to ensure rabbits are kept in a suitable environment , much like with cats and dogs .
my sisters have not found caring for their rabbits to be a burden because of the joy that they bring , and it disgusts me to think that so many parents have such a flippant attitude towards their actions .
gemma , sheffield , uk rabbits are great pets , if you are prepared to care for them .
i have 2 rescue rabbits and everyone acknowledges they are mine and not the children 's .
the care involved is huge , as much as owning a large dog. they need daily hygiene , a minimum of 2 hours of exercise , play and entertainment , some need daily grooming and all rabbits need a varied diet including mixed fresh vegetables .
i have advised many friends that have asked about rabbit ownership to consider the amount of care involved before making any purchases , and i try to ensure they understand how many bunnies need rehoming before they look at the cute bundles of fluff in a pet shop .
sharron , chandlers ford , hampshire i have two rabbits and they are perfectly healthy .
you just have to see that they are living breathing animals that need your love and care .
you ca n't just say " i 'm not going to clean their hutch or let them out because i do n't feel like it . "
anonymous , can someone explain what gives a human being the right to turn wild animals into pets ?
and what exactly does keeping a pet teach a child ?
how about observing animals free and in their natural habitat instead ?
of course patient observing of nature requires more effort , more involvement , and more knowledge , from the parents .
it teaches a child -lrb- and her parents ! -rrb- how to observe , it encourages her to be inquisitive and to try to interpret and question what she observes .
it also teaches respect for animals and nature , and readily leads to other worthwhile activities or hobbies .
much healthier for everyone than keeping a pet in a cage i think .
any thought anyone ?
pascal , london i rescued my pet rabbit , she 'd had been locked in a cage 24/7 ..
she now has a happy life here with us , she lives in the house with us & makes a great little pet ..
how can people be so cruel ?
if you have a rabbit make sure the hutch is big enough & please please make sure they have a decent size run .. karen mills , wrexham i cant understand some people .
how hard is it to look after a rabbit ? we decided to get my son a rabbit and we got a northumberland dwarf as they do n't grow very big , a little tip for people with a medium sized cage , also we got a male as they are they are the less aggressive type , and he 's gorgeous. we keep him in a hutch and he is fed twice a day , twice a week he has a treat of fresh veg , when weather is not too bad we just let him run about for an hour and he loves and springs about , we recently had his nails clipped and the vet said he was very healthy , he now comes to you when you feed him and nuzzles your hand , and do you know what i find it ten times easier looking after our rabbit than keeping up with all the housework , so come on people , no excuses ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! julie , sheffield we took a rabbit from one of the national pet shop chains as he looked in poor condition and cowering in a corner .
our rabbit is still very timid , over 2 years on and he has had some severe health problems which means he can not live outside , he lives in our house now and has the free run of the house , in essence , he 's a house bunny .
if you are going to get a rabbit , ensure that you can look after them , they need food , water , fruit and veg every day , plus hay .
they need grooming , neutering and plenty of exercise and attention .
we adore our rabbit and he gives us so much pleasure but they do require a lot of love , care and attention .
rabbits give so much back but if you ca n't afford to give them the time they deserve , please do n't buy one and please do n't buy one as a christmas present .
iona pippen , caerphilly i have 3 rabbits .
to give them up or to abandon them is just not a option .
it is hard work looking after the hutches in winter but i still get out there when its cold and clean them and feed them .
in the summer i trim there nails and let them out for runs .
they are the nicest creatures ever .
a message for all readers , " do n't abandon them always ring the rspca and get them taken away with dignity " .
yasmine , rotherham animal cruelty still shocks me every time i hear it .
i myself have 2 rabbits , 2 guinea pigs & 2 hamsters and i love them all so much .
i was surprised of how much hard work looking after a rabbit it .
there about the same hard work as a dog. all animals need excersise and a good diet and love and attention of course. but rabbits have a very sensitive stomach , need at least 2 hours of love & and affection a day and of course need to be let out of there cage for a few hours at least !
the punishment for animal cruelty should be firmer. not just a slap on the hand ! katie hamlet , aberystwyth , wales yes , i 've rescued a rabbit and i 'm waiting to rescue my next one .
it 's terrible to read what 's happening as rabbits make fantastic pets .
all you need is a bit of space and then watch them run , jump and play .
they are so funny to watch but sticking them in a teeny weeny hutch does n't let children -lrb- and adults -rrb- see their full potential .
they 're more playful than adult cats for example .
if you want a rabbit get the biggest hutch you can and a large run and get in there with them - you 're kids will be soon like my 3 year old son - ca n't get enough !
sarah miles , worcestershire we found a rabbit in the gutter five years ago .
nobody claimed her so we kept her but she has cost a considerable amount of money in vet bills over that time .
as much as we like her , a rabbit would not be first on our list of pets .
to throw a rabbit into a hutch and think that that 's all the life it needs is just wrong and cruel , they need a lot more mental stimulation than that .
as for them being a good children 's pet , that 's a myth , children will grow bored of them quickly , and rabbits are more fragile than people believe , serious back injury not being uncommon if they fall or jump the wrong way .
they should not be a disposable commodity in this disposable society .
carol brown , adelaide australia we 've had rabbits in my family for years and we always get them for rspca rescue centres .
it 's beyond me why anyone would pay for one at a pet shop when there are so many who needs homes and might be put down if they do n't find one .
to buy a pet without realising what 's involved and that you might get bored of it is sheer idiocy .
get a rabbit because you have compassion towards animals and rabbits and want it to be part of your family .
do n't get it if you really ca n't be bothered to pay for it , clean its hutch or let it run around for a few hours a day .
it just causes suffering .
andrew , nottingham , uk as a vet with a large primary and referral caseload in rabbits i see this every day .
people get bored of the rabbits very quickly , and have n't researched the costs and keeping of their animals at all .
it 's sickening to think i only see the ones who are honourable enough to bring their animal to us and admit their failure .
if a rabbit is healthy we do what we can to rehome it but it 's a losing battle .
i regularly see rabbits living to 10 years old , some to 12 , and those are the lucky ones .
the second commonest cruelty cases i consult for the rspca are abandoned rabbits , and we investigate those thoroughly - those we catch are prosecuted .
it is heartbreaking to see animals just dumped in the middle of a park with no food or water simply because ignorant people got tired of taking care of them .
with housing facilities at breaking point we have to be ruthless about those we keep , and those we have to euthanase .
it 's disgraceful we 're put in that position by those who take on what they can not care for .
the estimate of costs for keeping a rabbit in the article is about right .
the other problem is people not feeding their rabbits properly .
hay .
grass .
hay .
grass .
that 's it .
perhaps a supplement if you want to .
" mixes " and so on will just end up in dental disease , and a lifetime of pain and discomfort , and a huge vets ' bill .
think before you buy .
william easson , cardiff , wales i was given a rabbit about 6 years ago as a gift .
to be honest in the first week i was n't sure if i wanted him as i knew nothing about rabbits and i was bit nervous if he would bite me and from the way he would sprint around the room so fast i just got put off and at night would put him back in the hutch .
six years later i still have him and would never give him away as he is so intelligent , fun and affectionate and crafty i sometimes forget his a rabbit from the way he behaves .
he is litter trained and when he knows i have been into the kitchen he comes sprinting towards me as he knows his getting a treat .
the bottom line is although rabbits are not like other animals and do n't really make noise they are very sociable animals and the more time you spend with them the end results are amazing .
just because they are quiet and not like a puppy or kitten that does n't mean people should abuse them in anyway as they are also very delicate animals .
i love my bunny so much i let him i sleep in a massive indoor cage that i purchased that has ramps and toys for him .
rabbits get very stressed easily and it is not right to keep them locked in their hutch for too long .
i strongly feel that people should not be allowed to purchase rabbits or any animal for that fact if they are going to think of it as a short term interest .
rabbits are hard work as i know how many times i clean his cage and feed him because its not humane to let them stay in a dirty cage .
jay jay has been a really nice experience for me that six years ago i would have laughed but if you give it a chance and spend time with your rabbit the rewards you get back are priceless .
liza fortes , sudbury uk i have 8 rabbits , 4 of which are rescues .
one was found running around our road and nobody ever claimed him .
i have had him for 4 years now .
even though i handle him every day and he has been castrated he is still aggressive and i doubt he will ever get over anything that happened to him before he came to me .
another was used to breed baby rabbits to be used as food for snakes .
she was pregnant when she came to me .
she killed all the babies .
think of the animal and not your children .
they do n't need a rabbit .
it wo n't teach them responsibility .
maybe if people stopped buying them the demand would n't be there and people would n't be irresponsibly breeding them .
break that circle. em , bristol , uk i got my two rabbits from greenwich rabbit rescue .
both were 3 month old minilops , from different homes .
after some unsettled and anxious behaviour like peeing on my lap , running away from pointing fingers or nipping and keeping jaws open , they are now almost docile .
they pretty much have the run of the house , and when it 's not too cold , run around the garden for a few hours .
there is daily hutch cleaning and feeding , but otherwise , they are happy to lounge and hop about .
i have no kids , so maybe that helps. martha rumian , london uk i have taken in 2 rabbits over the years which were unwanted pets .
i have also taken in budgies , hamsters , and a dog which were all unwanted .
it really annoys me that people do n't think long term about pets and are quick to dismiss them .
bring back licences - as anyone prepared to buy a licence will be prepared to look after a pet long term .
it is something that should be taught in school - the cost and effort that goes into owning a pet -lrb- babies as well -rrb- .
i only support animal charities , and being so soft over animals , people will always come to me first with any unwanted pets - and i ca n't say no .
my local paper often advertises pieces on animal care - could this be done nationally ?
paula flinders , nottinghamshire i found our rabbit in our garden on 4 jan 04 .
i had seen her around the neighbourhood , under parked cars and running through the bushes .
i caught her and brought her into our home .
this is where she stayed for nearly 2 years , as my house rabbit .
she was very easy to train , she had a hutch in the utility room which was always open , there was a litter tray next to the hutch .
the back door to the garden was always open so she could hop in and out when she felt like it and when the weather was fine , she even used to hop back in to use the litter tray .
i have three children from 18 down to 12 and they adored her but she was my rabbit when it came to feeding , cleaning and clipping nails .
they just gave her a name ; fubu .
i had to have her put down last christmas as she had arthritis in her back legs due to the bad diet and care she used to suffer from .
this was heartbreaking to watch in such a friendly animal but this is what happens when people do n't care enough about their pets . !
ellen plowman , chippenham wilts i " adopted " a rabbit nobody else wanted when i was a child .
i 'm now 51 .
i still remember him along with the cats and dogs i 've had since then .
i remember the love i felt for him , the unconsolable sadness i felt when he died .
the feelings generated by loving and caring for my pets and the responsibility involved are things that i 've tried to pass on to my children .
i 'm absolutely sure this has made us better people .
i now have three abandoned cats and an abandoned dog .
abandoning pets says something about who we are and the society we 've all " helped " to create .
none of us should ignore this fact .
liz brindley , baiona , spain rabbits are social animals and so need company .
if you are going to keep a rabbit outdoors in a hutch they should be kept in neutered / spayed pairs for company .
the best combination is a male and a female .
if kept on their own rabbits can become very depressed .
a hutch should be large enough for the rabbits to stand up on their back legs and have a permanently attached run for exercise .
if you are going to keep rabbits with enough attention to their welfare then please bear in mind that they are not cheap pets .
the initial set up costs for a pair of rabbits with a suitable hutch , vaccinations , neutering / spaying and food is around £ 600 .
if you are n't prepared to spend this sort of money then you really should n't buy them because to not provide all they need is cruel .
having said all that rabbits make excellent pets , we have two which actually live in the house and give us many hours of pleasure .
in case you are wondering they are very clean and are easily litter trained !
richard thacker , bristol i recently took on a rabbit that someone no longer wanted .
he was kept in a tiny hutch 24 hours a day and rarely had any water or adequate food .
he now has a 7ft enclosure and run of the garden when we are home .
i have bonded him with my female and they are totally happy .
rabbits are not kids pets .
they can be feisty , hard to hold when fully grown and territorial when not neutered .
only get a rabbit if an adult will ultimately be responsible for it .
kids can not be expected to take sole responsibility for one .
rabbits should not be kept alone , or with a guinea pig .
they should be neutered , vaccinated , have time spent with them , get regular daily exercise , a good diet including a supply of hay constantly , the list is endless .
please , please , do not buy a rabbit on a whim without giving it a lot of thought .
please also do not buy from a pet shop when there are so many animals in rescue .
kate , birmingham , west midlands in 1997 we found a french lop rabbit that had been dumped and she was most probably was an unwanted easter bunny that was bought for a kid who grew bored of her .
many parents sadly give in to temptation and buy rabbits as pets for their kids on the spare of the moment no thought in their future care etc , not meaning to be cruel but the children just lose interest after a while and therefore the poor bunny suffers , locked up in its cage or even has no food or water .
many cages are way to small that they sell in pet shops and the poor bunnies who once fitted in them as babies and then soon row soon outgrow their enclosures and therefore have no room to move .
thumper was lucky we rescued her and lived a very long and happy life estimated to be between 9-13 years old , many parents need to be aware of the costs rabbits can occur in their lifetime which can be 7years or more ! and also they need to be aware that they need vaccinating against deadly diseases such as vhd and myximotosis. lisa yates , manchester i am only 14 we 've had 1 rabbit loads of hamsters and 3 guinea pigs our guinea pigs have out lasted all the hamsters and 1 of our dogs .
they live a longer healthier life if you let them outside in summer and inside for a run about in winter they also receive fresh fruit and veg at night and are know over 12 years old zoe handley -lrb- 14 -rrb- , derby uk last week i saved two lionhead rabbits 1 girl and 1 boy they were about 3 month old , which were housed in a small bird cage , they were living in filthy conditions they had no food or clean water .
thy female rabbit was really skinny and had large amounts of matted fur around her rear end , it took 45 mins to cut it away. they are now both happy and healthy rabbits. i already have 4 rabbits of my own , and they are in healthy condition , they are let out of their hutches everyday from 7.00am-8.30-9.00pm -lrb- into a 16foot log cabin , with mesh windows -rrb- and are cleaned twice a week , they are also provided with fresh greens everyday , i also have live with two lovely rottweiller who play and clean the rabbits. i think that if people are thinking of owing rabbits they should do some research before hand , because its not as easy as it looks. victoria , bedfordshire e-mail this to a friend related to this story : animal cases shock rspca officers -lrb- 10 nov 06 -pipe- cornwall -rrb- family rabbits stabbed to death -lrb- 19 sep 06 -pipe- north east / n isles -rrb- poorly rabbits dumped on roadside -lrb- 22 aug 06 -pipe- coventry / warwickshire -rrb- rspca criticises ' rabbit wedding ' -lrb- 04 apr 06 -pipe- hereford / worcs -rrb- crisis as pets breed like rabbits -lrb- 20 feb 06 -pipe- lincolnshire -rrb- related internet links rabbit welfare association rspca your pet rabbit the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites search bbc news : news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- education -pipe- magazine newswatch -pipe- notes -pipe- contact us -pipe- about bbc news -pipe- profiles -pipe- history ^ back to top -pipe- bbc sport home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- contact us -pipe- help -pipe- ©

when raf stafford was due to close the county council produced statistics to show the detrimental economic effect this would have to stafford borough .
with a sizeable proportion of the 7,000 people affected living and working in the area the impact to both the economy of the borough and to house prices could be severe .
has anyone called for an economic assessment ?
ed hooper , staffordshire when job evaluation is used in the private sector , which is n't that common , it is n't usually undertaken with the aim of imposing widespread and swingeing pay cuts ; job evaluation is n't scientific or infallible .
the margin of error means that many jobs are inappropriately downgraded ; council workers ' pay has dropped 20 % relative to pay in the wider economy since parity was last established by comparability in 1979 .
many essential workers already earn less than their private sector equivalents and plan to leave local government when the pay cuts are imposed ; the average council worker 's pension is £ 6,000 when the average pension in the wider economy is £ 11,000 ; j e isacon , england my salary will be going down 35 % to £ 16137 .
i am married with two children and a mortgage .
how will we survive this ?
i 'm appalled by the arrogant attitude of mr savege .
does he realise that if he gets his way there will be huge council tax rises as it will cost the county council a lot more to contract work out when we have all left the county council !
steve , england mr. savege stated that this process was to enable people -lrb- male / female -rrb- to be paid the same for doing the same job - if this is the case why then have people , who are doing identical jobs , been graded differently .
could it be because the county council do n't realise that the schemes they are using are seriously flawed .
as for the so called apology it is too late the damage has been done .
wendy , england i have worked for nearly 25 years for staffordshire county council in libraries and with experience and competitive interview gained small promotions which have now been devalued and degraded to be rendered meaningless .
i am now set to receive just £ 15,000 ... a drop of £ 3000 .
it seems the pay of the low paid is just being redistributed to other low paid workers and the reality is that a huge chasm is opening up between us and those like mr savege at the top of the tree who give themselves hefty payrises .
we have all been given a huge slap in the face .
cecile harrison , england job evaluation in staffordshire will equate to job migration .
employees are very upset and distressed with the way that this has been handled by the hr department , even those who have allegedly had a pay rise are supporting those against job evaluation .
as for equal pay for equal jobs , this is a nonsense .
my pay will stay the same as will another collegues who does the same job as myself .
this job evaluation is a cost cutting exercise which is being pushed through with the restructure to hide job losses and reduce the need for redundency pay , as many will seek to leave the department .
mandy harrison , england whilst a degree of sympathy has to go out to those that will lose out should the proposed pay structure be implemented following the je process , it is a certainty that zero regard will have been given by such individuals for those that have been paid disproportionately for doing a job requiring the same or comparable skills -in many cases for years .
it would be foolish and ignorant to assume the fact not a single comment on this web site supporting the process can be seen , is down to a purely negative reaction across the board .
there is certainly an element of people that have been underpaid for years , that having now had this recognised , feel embarrassed to claim what is rightfully theirs for fear of reprisals and that is wrong .
anon , england the impression i get is that the council are using the excuse of job evaluation to " fix " something that " ai n't broke " .
the amount paid by the council to an employee will always be determined largely by market forces , and no amount of " fixing " by the powers that be , will ever change this .
as margaret thatcher once said " you ca n't buck the market " .
job evaluation has suggested that almost 20,000 employees ' salaries are in error .
well , given a choice between ' the market ' and job evaluation , i would choose ' the market ' every time as the more accurate and fairer setter of employees salaries .
-lrb- btw , my salary 's down by £ 5k or 15 % . -rrb-
mike hinton , uk i am writing to express my disgust at the whole job evaluation scheme with is affecting me and thousands of my hard working colleagues .
i do not know how the county council expects the departments to work effectively when they know they can not pay their mortgage or feed their children .
it is a terrifying prospect .
although i did not see your programme , i thank you for bringing it to the attention of the wider public. paul rochfort , england in response to aaron and mark dean - it has been clearly proven that council staff across the country are paid no where near market levels for the jobs they do .
council staff work long hours to provide you the tax payer with the services you take for granted .
how would you like to receive a faceless side of a4 with minimal information on , telling you that " oops , sorry , you 'll have to take a £ 10,000 pay cut " ?
the county has continually hidden the truth about this proposal behind spin and more rhetoric - even to go on record as saying " our staff are our greatest asset " in response to the march last thursday ! !
savage has now gone on national tv to say " 45 % of staff go up " .
wrong ! ! ! 45 % of contracts go up , with alot of people in the posts being increased having more than 1 contract .
it is pure spin and half truthes to win over the media and the public .
45 % up by £ 500 does not equal 25 % down on average by £ 4000 .
you do the maths and tell me how this is not a cost cutting ! exercise .
richard pearce , jim savege had the chance live on television to apologise to the thousands upon thousands of council workers for who this job evaluation has caused demoralisation and distress .
but he chose not to .
council workers are the back bone to many front line services , most of those hardest hit are school support staff , including those who have worked hours upon hours of unpiad overtime as a good will gesture , including those who have worked tirelessly giving years and years continual service to the county .
so the council ca n't even give the smallest gesture of an apology , no wonder there is talk of a strike ! ! ! !
rob , england the day after all the support staff received this bombshell letter on 10 november , the teachers all received a mailout from the nut urging them to take action re ' reducing teachers workload ' - i 'm sure the teachers would n't take a 11-16 % pay cut , they would walk out , so why do staffordshire county council think they can do this to support staff ?
incredible !
so much for building a career to have the last three years performance progression wiped out in one move .
how to demoralise a whole section of the workforce with one blow ! fed up secretary , uk the proposed pay cuts for staffordshire county council employees have caused distress and anguish to people across all departments .
i am astounded that an organisation that employs 28,000 people has not set up a counselling service or a debt helpline .
instead , the booklet that was distributed with the letters lists the numbers of the citizen 's advice bureau , a clear indication that the council were aware of the stress and anxiety the proposed pay model was likely to cause .
olwen johnson , stafford , uk i earn £ 14523 per year as a library assistant at your library i work long hours often early mornings one evening a week till seven and saturday .
i 'm set to lose £ 400 per year so maybe i 'm one the lucky ones but what hurts the most is that your library staff score the the lowest on the je evaulation forms even the cleaners have more knowledge than your library staff who often spend time teaching people how to use computers and dealing bus and train timetable enquires .
all we want is a fair days money for a fair days work and to be shown a little repsect from ssc .
anon uk after 22 years service my salary will fall from £ 18,000 to £ 14,000 taking me back to where i was in 1997 .
i 'm single and disabled and would have to sell my home .
perhaps i should just live on the state ?
ed hooper , uk i would like to reply to those who think that county council workers are overpaid by giving a few examples of the proposed cuts .
i can understand that a £ 10,000 pay cut implies that the original salary is generous , but in fact this is a huge proportion of the individuals ' salaries , which is why this is so painful .
for example one of my colleagues would drop from £ 25,000 to £ 14,000 .
another would drop from £ 14,500 to £ 12,700 .
a couple of my colleagues would drop from £ 17,900 to £ 14,100 .
w. timothy , uk having analysed the spreadsheets supplied by the council , it does indeed seem that the " rises amount to no more than a few pounds in many cases , while the cuts are huge . "
sonia deol used those words to jim savege on tv , he effectively ignored the question , presumably because he had no answer and it gives the cost-cutting game away .
geoff , uk any staff who 's pay remains unchanged under the job evaluation and single status proposals , face the prospect of having no opportunity to get a pay rise in future because the top of the pay scale has been adjusted downwards .
this will have a similar impact on affected staff to the proposed pay cuts .
the effect of this -lrb- if implemented -rrb- will be to further negatively impact recruitment and retention which will already have been made virtually impossible for key staff particularly ict staff by the reduction in salaries !
yours , chris snow rugeley , staffs .
chris snow , uk mr savege ¿ s point that many people doing the same jobs are on different salaries , in response : 1 .
the law lords have ruled that different levels of pay are quite acceptable provided the reason for that difference is not sexual discrimination .
2 .
the employer has set these contracts up many in the last 10 years without properly evaluating them at the beginning , why should the employee pay for the employers mistakes ? 3 .
where was this sense of duty , when it came to employing people in the last 10 years and where is it now ?
this is a cynical ploy , to reduce staff numbers by getting them to leave so that the authority wo n't have to pay redundancies , which are already established as part of an ongoing review .
it might be worth asking him if he and the rest of the senior management team still think they have the confidence of the workforce ?
finally , if as stated this is a starting point for negotiation , why are cabinet being asked to make a decision on this in january , that is not consultation , but dictatorship , they could have consulted without setting up cabinet to decide on this ¿ .
p butler , uk i 'm a council worker and am set to lose over £ 4,000 .
having just watched your programme , i was astounded to hear jim savege 's comments .
i liked the way he avoided having to apologise for the upset and worry this process is causing .
you should have asked him about the £ 20,000 pay rise himself and the other directors have awarded themselves .
i 'm even more worried now as i received a letter on saturday from my mortgage lender saying from 1 january my mortgage will increase .
can things get any worse ?
this is making me ill .
mrs j , staffordshire i am writing with regard to the implementation of job evaluation at staffordshire county council , as an employee of some 25 years .
when the scheme was first introduced some 4 years ago , the principles and procedures were accepted by staff as a fair means to achieve parity of salaries across local authorities .
in retrospect , this now seems unquestioningly naive .
we have been subjected to a kafka-esque situation in which we were required to sign off the assessment of our jobs without knowledge of the scoring procedure , and before the pay model was determined .
sheila penfold , england i am senior science technician in a large secondary school .
i have worked in quality control laboratories in industry , have a degree in biology and environmental studies and have spent the last nine years working as a technician in schools , the last four years as senior technician .
my letter regarding the outcome of job evaluation put me on the same grade and salary as the other technicians , a drop of £ 1000 , admittedly not a huge reduction compared to many other workers in staffordshire , but this will mean i will have to sell my house and move to a smaller , cheaper property as i can not afford to pay bills such as council tax on the proposed new salary .
kathleen toms , i have been employed by staffordshire county council at the moorlands vi form centre as the receptionist for the past eight years .
i have been an extremely hard working , loyal member of staff who has always done my best for the centre .
the moorlands is quite unique as the vi form for cheadle high school , painsley catholic college and moorside high school , so we have a number of bosses and are very often pulled in all directions trying to please .
i am the second longest serving member of staff at the vi form and one of the lowest paid .
for at least the last six years i have been on the same salary , the top of scale 2 with nowhere to progress to career wise or salary wise .
when i asked about a pay rise about three years ago i was told that due to job evaluation being implemented i had to wait for the results of that , so i have waited and waited and waited only to be told that i am not even worth the money i am receiving and i am probably going to have a pay cut ! !
i am going from the top of scale 2 to the top of grade 3 , this puts me in exactly the same position i was in but for less pay ! !
how does this make sense ?
the information received by many was distressing and totally demoralising .
staff who have served the county for many years went home on black friday feeling undervalued and insulted by the proposals .
mrs jane spooner , cheadle , staffordshire how can the job evaluation board who set my salary 18 months ago now cut my salary by £ 3700 , did they get it wrong then ?
of the 45 % who are getting rises how many are part time cleaners , dinner ladies , i do not mention these to berate these important positions but to make the point that the rises are pennies for staff who work part time , the cuts however are huge on full time staff who certainly in my own case have a massive amount of responsibilty , to the 1400 pupils in our high school .
our own head who fully supports us , has done his sums , and after giving out the rises ancuts now has £ 22,000 left .
ian mirams , uk both of us work for staffordshire county council and both our salaries have been cut .
we are very angry about this , i bet jim savage has not taken a cut in his salary .
also for all the people who think we are overpaid , should try working for the council !
i think they would feel different .
lynn and trev phillips , england i am a staffordshire county council worker .
i undertake legal child protection work on behalf of social services .
i have been informed of a proposed pay cut of £ 5000 .
this is an insult to my professionalism and sustained commitment shown on behalf of theis authority over fifteen years .
je is a back door route to cutting salary costs .
the communication of the proposals , has a stroke devastated the morale of staff who feel a sense of betrayal. anthony gannon , uk i am appalled by the proposed salary cuts .
we do n't want an apology from jim savege .
we want an acknowledgement from nigel pursey that staffs cc has got it wrong !
it seems that schools have been the hardest hit in salary cuts .
are staffs cc are saying that the heads and governors have got it wrong with the salaries they give to support staff ?
how do you expect to recruit and retain quality support staff in schools under these proposed pay cuts ?
we provide a valuable support service within our school .
we are totally demoralised and devalued .
this is felt throughout our school and affects teaching staff , students , teaching & learning and ultimately results .
sara massey -lrb- learning centre manager , de ferrers specialist technology college , burton -rrb- why do we continueto put council run activities into private management to save money as council run facilities seem to be run for the employees and not the public !
bernard broadhurst , staffordshire i work at staffordshire county council as a personal assistant and after fifteen years service my salary has been cut by £ 4,500k a year .
to watch such a smug interview by mr jim savage has simply added fuel to the fire of the anger i feel for him and for staffordshire county council as a whole .
they are treating their staff with utter contempt and i feel the interview only proved to show the ¿ holier than thou ¿ attitude which is currently being shown to loyal employees .
there is no way the man will apologise to his staff ¿ let ¿ s face it he is in a job that is paying thousands of pounds more than any of us ¿ has his job been evaluated ?
somehow i think not .
daphne sharp , the cc fails to advise you that the 45 % of employees it keeps saying are getting a pay rise are in fact 45 % of contracts , not people .
this is because a lot of these people are so poorly paid they have to have 2 or 3 jobs to make ends meet .
this cc is morally corrupt and should not be allowed to get away with destroying people 's lives in this way.also this labour government will be very badly hit as many traditional labour voters will not vote for them at the naxt election .
gordon brown needs to do something about this very quickly before it is too late.please do not mention my name in respect of this issue as i do fear recriminations anon , uk , staffordshire re-evaluation of council job descriptions .
the question of salary / wage equalisation will obviously pose many problems , particularly for those taking cuts in the proportions publicised .
however , there is one important question to be answered as a forerunner to the debate : " how will those involved in planning and implementing the proposals be affected " particularly senior executives and top administration ?
they should precede any comments , interviews or discussions with this information .
let them demonstrate how they will be part of the suffering .
les cooper , pensioners ' campaigner uk i am pa to a senior manager at staffordshire county council .
i have been down graded and stand to lose £ 2,000 per annum .
i recently attended a long service award ceremony with a colleague who has worked as a pa for 25 years , a week later she was downgraded and her salary would be reduced by £ 4,000 per annum .
a fitting reward for loyal service !
jim savege said that some people are doing the same jobs for different pay - this may be , but some people have more experience and i for one would expect a long serving member of staff to earn more money .
we have not been able to find many colleagues who will benefit , those whose salaries will increase will also be subject to no progression in the years to come and will therefore ultimately lose out .
when i signed my contract of employment i was happy to work for the salary offered i did not expect the contract to be broken .
we have all been demoralised by the whole process and feel that our hard work and loyalty are of no value .
freda green freda green , england many people have not even had a copy of their job over view , how is this consultation ? john , uk on the issue of single status in staffordshire , as it concerns equal pay , why does it not affect all levels of staff ie the senior management such as assistant directors and above ?
this is obviously only equal pay targeting the actual workers and is not aimed at the decision makers enforcing the policy !
local authority employee , england one point that the show did not cover was the real effects of the pay cuts , quoted as a percentage of real-salaries , afterall , a £ 10,000 pay cut will seam trivial to the rate payers if they also assume a salary of £ 100,0000 .
the view might change if the show had quoted a 40 % pay cut instead , for a job role which is already under paid when compared to the salary of the teachers who did the role , prior to the govermeents ' teacher work force remodelling ' programme .
it was also interesting that mr. savege was using percentages to justify the pay rises , but was not countered in a percentage manner by the interviewer .
leigh , uk i do n't know of any one who has their wages put up .
however all of my collegues in it have been cut up to £ 10,000 .
di brown , england i work for dudley council and we are at present going through the initial stages of this single status but we will have to wait until next year for the decisions .
i will be very interested to see what happens in staffordshire and all the other local councils .
we work very hard and deserve a decent days pay .
barry knowles , dudley perhaps you might like to ask mr savege this question : the explanatory booklet distributed to staff , with the accompanying job evaluation letter , states that : " through the introduction of an element of ' contribution - related pay ' , we can ensure that pay and grading review arrangements support and encourage all employees to achieve their full potential " .
their current proposal will put me back to a salary level that i had previously strived hard to reach some 5 years ago .
how does this help me continue to try and achieve my full potential ?
jeff stevens do n't be fooled by jim savege 's clever words and percentages .
even the 40 % of people who he claims will stay the same under the proposals are in fact losing money .
staffordshire county council is using the equality issue to save costs not to equalise pay ! !
loser2 , uk re the council cuts .
i work for the council and face a cut of £ 4,000 .
what i would like the council to clarify is the actual scale of the increases - jim quoted one person going up by £ 12k - i am not aware of any rises other than people possibly going up by a few hundred pounds per year- not balanced out by the thousands i and many many others stand to lose .
also - would like to point out the potential impact on local businesses - if my pay is cut for example i in turn will spend less in local shops and businesses .
joanne sherratt , england re - single status in midlands local authority it is unacceptable & immoral to cut the pay of professional white collar staff , using a crude & flawed job evaluation pay model , in order to fund pay rises for manual groups of workers .
staffordshire council will lose staff & staff good will through this bungled exercise andrew frank , england the percentage of staff who have had an increase in pay are in general part time workers and the increase is a couple of pounds a week .
in the trading standards department the lower grade of staff have seen a cut in pay while the highest grade have seen an increase .
all have seen a cap put on acreer progression .
how can this be equality of pay mark jurkiewicz , stafford uk wondered if your guest from hr on the council this morning is also taking a pay cut joe , uk my girlfriend works for the council and is to lose £ 4,500 from her salary .
what jim savege failed to mention is that all the top bosses have vetoed their salaries so they are not affected by the single salary status .
jobs for the boys or what ?
jes smart , stafford england council workers are already overpaid in my view and i would hate to pay more council tax to fund more money in their pay packet .
mark dean , midlands , uk interesting that again the message that 45 % of people are going up .
unfortunatly it would appear that these statistics are based on contracts not individuals .
a lot of staff have more than one contract , and as such some people are gaining as little as 30 pounds on one contract but losing thousands on the other .
if the council accepts that they have been under paying some staff then they should n't steal the money back from " their most valuable asset " as they put it .
the statistics are not worth the paper they are printed on untill all the base information / data is made available .
mark , england poor public sector workers .
welcome to the real world !
this kind of thing happens in the private sector all the time and we do n't have secure pensions to look forward to ! !
if you do n't like it , get another job .
richard , uk my husband also works for a local authority which is undergoing the same process , we would like to know is there any legal limit on the amount of reduction made to someones salary ?
it surely can not be legal to make a significant reduction when this will have a knock on effect to both their pension and every day life ?
thank you mrs taylor , uk i break even under the current proposals but am incensed by the appalling way staffordshire is treating its staff .
the statistics put out are very misleading and are skewed by , amongst other things , the inclusion of small gains for many part-time staff the figures for who should be converted to full time equivalents to show a more accurate reflection of the position .
a lot of damage has already been done and i find it difficult to envisage goodwill getting back to previous levels at least not for the foreseeable future .
terry edwards , uk as a scc employee , my main concern is that the headline figures given by the county council have been manipulated and are misleading spin .
the percentages of 45 % up , 30 % unchanged and 25 % down refer to ' contracts ' and include part time staff such as dinner ladies and school crossing patroles , many of whom are in the ' up ' group .
so a professional standing to loose up to £ 12,000 is counted against many part time workers who may all be give an extra few pounds in there pay packets .
additionally , my letter indicated that my salery would remain unchanged but that is based on my current pay and by the time the proposals would come into effect next year , i would take a cut so should n't i be one of the ' down ' section ?
this again would not make the story as good as the job evaluation team and their management would like .
however , getting any additional information , other than the official stroy has proved very difficult and i myself have not recieved satisfactory responces to request made under the freedom of information act 2000 .
chris mitchell , uk i consider myself extemely fortunate as my salary under job evaluation will remain unchanged , however i am totally in support of my colleagues who are taking massive pay cuts .
it is not just the people who will be losing who disagree with the present outcome of job evaluation .
the effect on morale is devastating and the county council must understand that service delivery will inevertably be seriously affected .
alan wrench , england my partner and i both work for staffordshire county council .
our combined loss is £ 6000 .
we are expecting our first child in march 2006 and are extremely concerned at how we will cope with mortgage payments and the cost of bringing up a young child .
apart from our own issues i have noticed morale in the office is at an all time low .
the standard of the service that we provide has also suffered .
no one is prepared to go the extra inch to ensure customers are happy anymore .
i hope councillors realise the impact this will have on their constituents .
richard harris , uk in the department where i work , -lrb- development services -rrb- , which deals with highways and planning , 67 % of staff will receive a reduction in their pay - that 's not job evaluation , its an out and out pay cut and its scandalous .
richard , england my current salary is £ 30843 going down to £ 23952 .
i am very disappointed in the way staffordshire county council have dealt with the job evaluation process .
i have only worked for the council for less than 3 years in this current position and i am struggling to see why the remuneration for this job has changed so dramatically the main question for me is how can the council really expect employees to take such a huge pay cut .
this proposal is not only morally incorrect -lrb- i expect more from a local government employer -rrb- but actually is unsustainable by the council .
helen bradley , my salary will fall by £ 5200 .
not only do they propose cutting pay but grades have altered - employees can longer work towards a higher grade .
many who have had a pay rise will not in fact have a job in a year or so !
people working in residential homes -lrb- they are closing -rrb- home carers -lrb- numbers being reduced by at least 50 % -rrb- management do not tell this to the media .
the way that the mr pursey and mr savege are treating their employees is disgraceful - i no longer trust anything they say .
they have destroyed our goodwill in one fell swoop .
they have not arrived at this with the unions and this needs to be exposed .
sue mountford , england after 20 years as a surveyor at british coal i went to leicestershire county council after 10 years as head of planning enforcement we underwent job evaluation in 2002 .
i took a small cut in salary and along with many colleagues including all of the planning enforcement officers i voted with my resignation and relocated to staffordshire county council as team leader responsible for the planning regulation team .
only to be presented 4 years later with a proposal to cut the team salaries by £ 6000 and because of the removal of career grades for established officers and increments for new starters this could be as much as £ 11000 for the team .
how can resolving the injustice of unequal pay be solved by creating even more injustice , at this time of year the people of staffordshire , for whom we all work will see a reduction in service from disillusioned staff and will ultimately express their views at the ballot box .
doug walker , england i work for staffordshire county council and feel the whole process has been dealt with very badly .
if these proposals are implemented the county will be a lot poorer for the people who live here who deserve a good standard of service , i am afraid these will suffer as experienced and devoted staff will leave. nick boot , england at the time of the 1997 single status agreement , the signatory unions and employers had not secured the necessary funding from central government -lrb- unlike the nhs agenda for change -rrb- .
union branches are now left to try and clear up this nationally negotiated idealogical mess at local level and their members -lrb- many of who are female -rrb- are paying the price with significant salary cuts .
anon from birmingham , england these percentage figures -lrb- 45 % up , 25 % down -rrb- are based on contracts , not head-count .
many casuals , p art-timers have multiple contracts .
everyone who sees these figures assume they relate to head-count .
this fact alone warps their meaning .
most of the losers are full-timers losing obscene amounts , as stated .
based on fte -lrb- full-time equivalents -rrb- the losers will outweigh the winners significantly in both head-count and monetary losses .
employees are demanding these figures , but the employer persists in withholding the data and spinning the statistics .
anonymous , england i am one of the very concerned 28.000 employees working for staffordshire county council .
i took part in yesterday 's demonstration which again received a lot of media coverage .
i am still in a state of shock as far as the new pay proposals are concerned and can not believe that as local authority workers the government are prepared to subject us to this .
but what bothers me most at the moment is how this whole job evaluation is coming across in the media .
it is not just the alleged 25 % of workers who stand to loose that are distressed by this proposal it is the entirety of the workforce .
everyone looses there are no clear winners .
all of the grades have been reduced from the top right through to the bottom .
county councillors are not fully aware of what is going on around them for the most part they live in their own little social bubble .
the job evaluation process is far from fair it is discriminatory .
it has thrown up so many inconsistencies and anomalies be beggars belief .
and lastly and probably most importantly is the array of services we provide , most of staffordshire county council employees do more than what is included in our job descriptions , we work long hours and do n't get overtime , we do n't use our flexi time , some of use do n't even claim expenses .
a huge chunck of our work revolves around good will and a can do approach .
good will that is directed at providing the best possible service we can to the public despite staff shortages and financial restraints .
sarah fraser , staffordshire . , england your phone calls ...
i work at staffordshire county council and i am in charge of 25 people .
as of yet i do n't know what my salary will be but i know that the staff that work for me are very upset and de-motivated about their situation .
this is making for the very difficult working day .
anonymous , west midlands as a council tax payer these cuts by staffordshire council for their workers must prove the incompetence of the council .
if they were paying people £ 12 000 over what they say they require now , then why they were paying it for so long time ?
this is just another example of how council tax payers ' money is being wasted .
george , newcastle-under-lyme my daughter is one of those who will have a pay cut .
she is highly qualified and does a great deal of overtime unpaid .
i think that these people are being treated absolutely disgracefully .
this is a policy of the old victorian mine owners where they think they can just come along and cut people 's pay by thousands of pounds .
but nobody thinks what these people will do , where they will find the money for mortgages , clothing , etc .
these people may lose their homes .
they are sitting and crying about it but the authorities do not care .
mrs e. biddle , stafford i 've worked for the staffordshire county council since 1978 and i 'm retiring this christmas .
my wages when i started was £ 4.10 and i am now on £ 5.80 .
where is inflation in 28 years ?
margaret , stafford as far as i 'm concerned council employees are overpaid .
if they think that they can go to the private sector and can earn as much money with gold plated pension at the age of 60 , then let them do so .
if they ca n't then they should accept the proposal put forward .
aaron , walsall i work in the education department of staffordshire county council .
my colleagues and i are all being paid a different amount .
there is no recognition of experience or qualifications .
people who have been working for 12 years are getting pay cut below people who only just started .
we are all disgusted with how we have been treated .
we are being informed about £ 15.000 pay cut by a letter !
anonymous , staffordshire i am a pa to deputy corporate director .
my wage will be dropped by £ 2250 and my line manager 's by £ 7500 .
i do n't understand where my career structure has gone after 19 years of service .
it does n't seem fair at all !
tracey , stafford looking at the road alterations around our area i think that all the planers involved must be overpaid judging by the standard of the work they do .
if £ 10.000 can be a reduction in salary then what the original salaries are like ?
william , gloucester i work for the staffordshire county council and my salary will be cut .
i am disgusted that no apology has been given to us from your guest .
steve , staffordshire i work for the staffordshire county council and under the job evaluation scheme i 've been classified as one of the winners .
however , for the next 3 years i will not receive any pay increase , no career progression .
as a qualified solicitor it was my choice to work for local government but i do have doubts now .
anonymous , staffordshire i 've worked for the council for 20 years and i 'm disgusted with the way i 've been treated .
julie , stoke-on-trent i think that the wage structures that the council implemented over the years , they are responsible for the problems that have been created .
mr davis , walsall i am an employee of staffordshire county council .
my job is a unique , technical post .
i was employed in march this year and nobody mentioned any job evaluation scheme back then .
i think the county council will loose lots of qualified and devoted staff ..
mark , stoke-on-trent this situation is an absolute disgrace .
if there are two people on the same job , the lower one should be brought up to the higher one .
i would definitely support the strike .

when raf stafford was due to close the county council produced statistics to show the detrimental economic effect this would have to stafford borough .
with a sizeable proportion of the 7,000 people affected living and working in the area the impact to both the economy of the borough and to house prices could be severe .
has anyone called for an economic assessment ?
ed hooper , staffordshire when job evaluation is used in the private sector , which is n't that common , it is n't usually undertaken with the aim of imposing widespread and swingeing pay cuts ; job evaluation is n't scientific or infallible .
the margin of error means that many jobs are inappropriately downgraded ; council workers ' pay has dropped 20 % relative to pay in the wider economy since parity was last established by comparability in 1979 .
many essential workers already earn less than their private sector equivalents and plan to leave local government when the pay cuts are imposed ; the average council worker 's pension is £ 6,000 when the average pension in the wider economy is £ 11,000 ; j e isacon , england my salary will be going down 35 % to £ 16137 .
i am married with two children and a mortgage .
how will we survive this ?
i 'm appalled by the arrogant attitude of mr savege .
does he realise that if he gets his way there will be huge council tax rises as it will cost the county council a lot more to contract work out when we have all left the county council !
steve , england mr. savege stated that this process was to enable people -lrb- male / female -rrb- to be paid the same for doing the same job - if this is the case why then have people , who are doing identical jobs , been graded differently .
could it be because the county council do n't realise that the schemes they are using are seriously flawed .
as for the so called apology it is too late the damage has been done .
wendy , england i have worked for nearly 25 years for staffordshire county council in libraries and with experience and competitive interview gained small promotions which have now been devalued and degraded to be rendered meaningless .
i am now set to receive just £ 15,000 ... a drop of £ 3000 .
it seems the pay of the low paid is just being redistributed to other low paid workers and the reality is that a huge chasm is opening up between us and those like mr savege at the top of the tree who give themselves hefty payrises .
we have all been given a huge slap in the face .
cecile harrison , england job evaluation in staffordshire will equate to job migration .
employees are very upset and distressed with the way that this has been handled by the hr department , even those who have allegedly had a pay rise are supporting those against job evaluation .
as for equal pay for equal jobs , this is a nonsense .
my pay will stay the same as will another collegues who does the same job as myself .
this job evaluation is a cost cutting exercise which is being pushed through with the restructure to hide job losses and reduce the need for redundency pay , as many will seek to leave the department .
mandy harrison , england whilst a degree of sympathy has to go out to those that will lose out should the proposed pay structure be implemented following the je process , it is a certainty that zero regard will have been given by such individuals for those that have been paid disproportionately for doing a job requiring the same or comparable skills -in many cases for years .
it would be foolish and ignorant to assume the fact not a single comment on this web site supporting the process can be seen , is down to a purely negative reaction across the board .
there is certainly an element of people that have been underpaid for years , that having now had this recognised , feel embarrassed to claim what is rightfully theirs for fear of reprisals and that is wrong .
anon , england the impression i get is that the council are using the excuse of job evaluation to " fix " something that " ai n't broke " .
the amount paid by the council to an employee will always be determined largely by market forces , and no amount of " fixing " by the powers that be , will ever change this .
as margaret thatcher once said " you ca n't buck the market " .
job evaluation has suggested that almost 20,000 employees ' salaries are in error .
well , given a choice between ' the market ' and job evaluation , i would choose ' the market ' every time as the more accurate and fairer setter of employees salaries .
-lrb- btw , my salary 's down by £ 5k or 15 % . -rrb-
mike hinton , uk i am writing to express my disgust at the whole job evaluation scheme with is affecting me and thousands of my hard working colleagues .
i do not know how the county council expects the departments to work effectively when they know they can not pay their mortgage or feed their children .
it is a terrifying prospect .
although i did not see your programme , i thank you for bringing it to the attention of the wider public. paul rochfort , england in response to aaron and mark dean - it has been clearly proven that council staff across the country are paid no where near market levels for the jobs they do .
council staff work long hours to provide you the tax payer with the services you take for granted .
how would you like to receive a faceless side of a4 with minimal information on , telling you that " oops , sorry , you 'll have to take a £ 10,000 pay cut " ?
the county has continually hidden the truth about this proposal behind spin and more rhetoric - even to go on record as saying " our staff are our greatest asset " in response to the march last thursday ! !
savage has now gone on national tv to say " 45 % of staff go up " .
wrong ! ! ! 45 % of contracts go up , with alot of people in the posts being increased having more than 1 contract .
it is pure spin and half truthes to win over the media and the public .
45 % up by £ 500 does not equal 25 % down on average by £ 4000 .
you do the maths and tell me how this is not a cost cutting ! exercise .
richard pearce , jim savege had the chance live on television to apologise to the thousands upon thousands of council workers for who this job evaluation has caused demoralisation and distress .
but he chose not to .
council workers are the back bone to many front line services , most of those hardest hit are school support staff , including those who have worked hours upon hours of unpiad overtime as a good will gesture , including those who have worked tirelessly giving years and years continual service to the county .
so the council ca n't even give the smallest gesture of an apology , no wonder there is talk of a strike ! ! ! !
rob , england the day after all the support staff received this bombshell letter on 10 november , the teachers all received a mailout from the nut urging them to take action re ' reducing teachers workload ' - i 'm sure the teachers would n't take a 11-16 % pay cut , they would walk out , so why do staffordshire county council think they can do this to support staff ?
incredible !
so much for building a career to have the last three years performance progression wiped out in one move .
how to demoralise a whole section of the workforce with one blow ! fed up secretary , uk the proposed pay cuts for staffordshire county council employees have caused distress and anguish to people across all departments .
i am astounded that an organisation that employs 28,000 people has not set up a counselling service or a debt helpline .
instead , the booklet that was distributed with the letters lists the numbers of the citizen 's advice bureau , a clear indication that the council were aware of the stress and anxiety the proposed pay model was likely to cause .
olwen johnson , stafford , uk i earn £ 14523 per year as a library assistant at your library i work long hours often early mornings one evening a week till seven and saturday .
i 'm set to lose £ 400 per year so maybe i 'm one the lucky ones but what hurts the most is that your library staff score the the lowest on the je evaulation forms even the cleaners have more knowledge than your library staff who often spend time teaching people how to use computers and dealing bus and train timetable enquires .
all we want is a fair days money for a fair days work and to be shown a little repsect from ssc .
anon uk after 22 years service my salary will fall from £ 18,000 to £ 14,000 taking me back to where i was in 1997 .
i 'm single and disabled and would have to sell my home .
perhaps i should just live on the state ?
ed hooper , uk i would like to reply to those who think that county council workers are overpaid by giving a few examples of the proposed cuts .
i can understand that a £ 10,000 pay cut implies that the original salary is generous , but in fact this is a huge proportion of the individuals ' salaries , which is why this is so painful .
for example one of my colleagues would drop from £ 25,000 to £ 14,000 .
another would drop from £ 14,500 to £ 12,700 .
a couple of my colleagues would drop from £ 17,900 to £ 14,100 .
w. timothy , uk having analysed the spreadsheets supplied by the council , it does indeed seem that the " rises amount to no more than a few pounds in many cases , while the cuts are huge . "
sonia deol used those words to jim savege on tv , he effectively ignored the question , presumably because he had no answer and it gives the cost-cutting game away .
geoff , uk any staff who 's pay remains unchanged under the job evaluation and single status proposals , face the prospect of having no opportunity to get a pay rise in future because the top of the pay scale has been adjusted downwards .
this will have a similar impact on affected staff to the proposed pay cuts .
the effect of this -lrb- if implemented -rrb- will be to further negatively impact recruitment and retention which will already have been made virtually impossible for key staff particularly ict staff by the reduction in salaries !
yours , chris snow rugeley , staffs .
chris snow , uk mr savege ¿ s point that many people doing the same jobs are on different salaries , in response : 1 .
the law lords have ruled that different levels of pay are quite acceptable provided the reason for that difference is not sexual discrimination .
2 .
the employer has set these contracts up many in the last 10 years without properly evaluating them at the beginning , why should the employee pay for the employers mistakes ? 3 .
where was this sense of duty , when it came to employing people in the last 10 years and where is it now ?
this is a cynical ploy , to reduce staff numbers by getting them to leave so that the authority wo n't have to pay redundancies , which are already established as part of an ongoing review .
it might be worth asking him if he and the rest of the senior management team still think they have the confidence of the workforce ?
finally , if as stated this is a starting point for negotiation , why are cabinet being asked to make a decision on this in january , that is not consultation , but dictatorship , they could have consulted without setting up cabinet to decide on this ¿ .
p butler , uk i 'm a council worker and am set to lose over £ 4,000 .
having just watched your programme , i was astounded to hear jim savege 's comments .
i liked the way he avoided having to apologise for the upset and worry this process is causing .
you should have asked him about the £ 20,000 pay rise himself and the other directors have awarded themselves .
i 'm even more worried now as i received a letter on saturday from my mortgage lender saying from 1 january my mortgage will increase .
can things get any worse ?
this is making me ill .
mrs j , staffordshire i am writing with regard to the implementation of job evaluation at staffordshire county council , as an employee of some 25 years .
when the scheme was first introduced some 4 years ago , the principles and procedures were accepted by staff as a fair means to achieve parity of salaries across local authorities .
in retrospect , this now seems unquestioningly naive .
we have been subjected to a kafka-esque situation in which we were required to sign off the assessment of our jobs without knowledge of the scoring procedure , and before the pay model was determined .
sheila penfold , england i am senior science technician in a large secondary school .
i have worked in quality control laboratories in industry , have a degree in biology and environmental studies and have spent the last nine years working as a technician in schools , the last four years as senior technician .
my letter regarding the outcome of job evaluation put me on the same grade and salary as the other technicians , a drop of £ 1000 , admittedly not a huge reduction compared to many other workers in staffordshire , but this will mean i will have to sell my house and move to a smaller , cheaper property as i can not afford to pay bills such as council tax on the proposed new salary .
kathleen toms , i have been employed by staffordshire county council at the moorlands vi form centre as the receptionist for the past eight years .
i have been an extremely hard working , loyal member of staff who has always done my best for the centre .
the moorlands is quite unique as the vi form for cheadle high school , painsley catholic college and moorside high school , so we have a number of bosses and are very often pulled in all directions trying to please .
i am the second longest serving member of staff at the vi form and one of the lowest paid .
for at least the last six years i have been on the same salary , the top of scale 2 with nowhere to progress to career wise or salary wise .
when i asked about a pay rise about three years ago i was told that due to job evaluation being implemented i had to wait for the results of that , so i have waited and waited and waited only to be told that i am not even worth the money i am receiving and i am probably going to have a pay cut ! !
i am going from the top of scale 2 to the top of grade 3 , this puts me in exactly the same position i was in but for less pay ! !
how does this make sense ?
the information received by many was distressing and totally demoralising .
staff who have served the county for many years went home on black friday feeling undervalued and insulted by the proposals .
mrs jane spooner , cheadle , staffordshire how can the job evaluation board who set my salary 18 months ago now cut my salary by £ 3700 , did they get it wrong then ?
of the 45 % who are getting rises how many are part time cleaners , dinner ladies , i do not mention these to berate these important positions but to make the point that the rises are pennies for staff who work part time , the cuts however are huge on full time staff who certainly in my own case have a massive amount of responsibilty , to the 1400 pupils in our high school .
our own head who fully supports us , has done his sums , and after giving out the rises ancuts now has £ 22,000 left .
ian mirams , uk both of us work for staffordshire county council and both our salaries have been cut .
we are very angry about this , i bet jim savage has not taken a cut in his salary .
also for all the people who think we are overpaid , should try working for the council !
i think they would feel different .
lynn and trev phillips , england i am a staffordshire county council worker .
i undertake legal child protection work on behalf of social services .
i have been informed of a proposed pay cut of £ 5000 .
this is an insult to my professionalism and sustained commitment shown on behalf of theis authority over fifteen years .
je is a back door route to cutting salary costs .
the communication of the proposals , has a stroke devastated the morale of staff who feel a sense of betrayal. anthony gannon , uk i am appalled by the proposed salary cuts .
we do n't want an apology from jim savege .
we want an acknowledgement from nigel pursey that staffs cc has got it wrong !
it seems that schools have been the hardest hit in salary cuts .
are staffs cc are saying that the heads and governors have got it wrong with the salaries they give to support staff ?
how do you expect to recruit and retain quality support staff in schools under these proposed pay cuts ?
we provide a valuable support service within our school .
we are totally demoralised and devalued .
this is felt throughout our school and affects teaching staff , students , teaching & learning and ultimately results .
sara massey -lrb- learning centre manager , de ferrers specialist technology college , burton -rrb- why do we continueto put council run activities into private management to save money as council run facilities seem to be run for the employees and not the public !
bernard broadhurst , staffordshire i work at staffordshire county council as a personal assistant and after fifteen years service my salary has been cut by £ 4,500k a year .
to watch such a smug interview by mr jim savage has simply added fuel to the fire of the anger i feel for him and for staffordshire county council as a whole .
they are treating their staff with utter contempt and i feel the interview only proved to show the ¿ holier than thou ¿ attitude which is currently being shown to loyal employees .
there is no way the man will apologise to his staff ¿ let ¿ s face it he is in a job that is paying thousands of pounds more than any of us ¿ has his job been evaluated ?
somehow i think not .
daphne sharp , the cc fails to advise you that the 45 % of employees it keeps saying are getting a pay rise are in fact 45 % of contracts , not people .
this is because a lot of these people are so poorly paid they have to have 2 or 3 jobs to make ends meet .
this cc is morally corrupt and should not be allowed to get away with destroying people 's lives in this way.also this labour government will be very badly hit as many traditional labour voters will not vote for them at the naxt election .
gordon brown needs to do something about this very quickly before it is too late.please do not mention my name in respect of this issue as i do fear recriminations anon , uk , staffordshire re-evaluation of council job descriptions .
the question of salary / wage equalisation will obviously pose many problems , particularly for those taking cuts in the proportions publicised .
however , there is one important question to be answered as a forerunner to the debate : " how will those involved in planning and implementing the proposals be affected " particularly senior executives and top administration ?
they should precede any comments , interviews or discussions with this information .
let them demonstrate how they will be part of the suffering .
les cooper , pensioners ' campaigner uk i am pa to a senior manager at staffordshire county council .
i have been down graded and stand to lose £ 2,000 per annum .
i recently attended a long service award ceremony with a colleague who has worked as a pa for 25 years , a week later she was downgraded and her salary would be reduced by £ 4,000 per annum .
a fitting reward for loyal service !
jim savege said that some people are doing the same jobs for different pay - this may be , but some people have more experience and i for one would expect a long serving member of staff to earn more money .
we have not been able to find many colleagues who will benefit , those whose salaries will increase will also be subject to no progression in the years to come and will therefore ultimately lose out .
when i signed my contract of employment i was happy to work for the salary offered i did not expect the contract to be broken .
we have all been demoralised by the whole process and feel that our hard work and loyalty are of no value .
freda green freda green , england many people have not even had a copy of their job over view , how is this consultation ? john , uk on the issue of single status in staffordshire , as it concerns equal pay , why does it not affect all levels of staff ie the senior management such as assistant directors and above ?
this is obviously only equal pay targeting the actual workers and is not aimed at the decision makers enforcing the policy !
local authority employee , england one point that the show did not cover was the real effects of the pay cuts , quoted as a percentage of real-salaries , afterall , a £ 10,000 pay cut will seam trivial to the rate payers if they also assume a salary of £ 100,0000 .
the view might change if the show had quoted a 40 % pay cut instead , for a job role which is already under paid when compared to the salary of the teachers who did the role , prior to the govermeents ' teacher work force remodelling ' programme .
it was also interesting that mr. savege was using percentages to justify the pay rises , but was not countered in a percentage manner by the interviewer .
leigh , uk i do n't know of any one who has their wages put up .
however all of my collegues in it have been cut up to £ 10,000 .
di brown , england i work for dudley council and we are at present going through the initial stages of this single status but we will have to wait until next year for the decisions .
i will be very interested to see what happens in staffordshire and all the other local councils .
we work very hard and deserve a decent days pay .
barry knowles , dudley perhaps you might like to ask mr savege this question : the explanatory booklet distributed to staff , with the accompanying job evaluation letter , states that : " through the introduction of an element of ' contribution - related pay ' , we can ensure that pay and grading review arrangements support and encourage all employees to achieve their full potential " .
their current proposal will put me back to a salary level that i had previously strived hard to reach some 5 years ago .
how does this help me continue to try and achieve my full potential ?
jeff stevens do n't be fooled by jim savege 's clever words and percentages .
even the 40 % of people who he claims will stay the same under the proposals are in fact losing money .
staffordshire county council is using the equality issue to save costs not to equalise pay ! !
loser2 , uk re the council cuts .
i work for the council and face a cut of £ 4,000 .
what i would like the council to clarify is the actual scale of the increases - jim quoted one person going up by £ 12k - i am not aware of any rises other than people possibly going up by a few hundred pounds per year- not balanced out by the thousands i and many many others stand to lose .
also - would like to point out the potential impact on local businesses - if my pay is cut for example i in turn will spend less in local shops and businesses .
joanne sherratt , england re - single status in midlands local authority it is unacceptable & immoral to cut the pay of professional white collar staff , using a crude & flawed job evaluation pay model , in order to fund pay rises for manual groups of workers .
staffordshire council will lose staff & staff good will through this bungled exercise andrew frank , england the percentage of staff who have had an increase in pay are in general part time workers and the increase is a couple of pounds a week .
in the trading standards department the lower grade of staff have seen a cut in pay while the highest grade have seen an increase .
all have seen a cap put on acreer progression .
how can this be equality of pay mark jurkiewicz , stafford uk wondered if your guest from hr on the council this morning is also taking a pay cut joe , uk my girlfriend works for the council and is to lose £ 4,500 from her salary .
what jim savege failed to mention is that all the top bosses have vetoed their salaries so they are not affected by the single salary status .
jobs for the boys or what ?
jes smart , stafford england council workers are already overpaid in my view and i would hate to pay more council tax to fund more money in their pay packet .
mark dean , midlands , uk interesting that again the message that 45 % of people are going up .
unfortunatly it would appear that these statistics are based on contracts not individuals .
a lot of staff have more than one contract , and as such some people are gaining as little as 30 pounds on one contract but losing thousands on the other .
if the council accepts that they have been under paying some staff then they should n't steal the money back from " their most valuable asset " as they put it .
the statistics are not worth the paper they are printed on untill all the base information / data is made available .
mark , england poor public sector workers .
welcome to the real world !
this kind of thing happens in the private sector all the time and we do n't have secure pensions to look forward to ! !
if you do n't like it , get another job .
richard , uk my husband also works for a local authority which is undergoing the same process , we would like to know is there any legal limit on the amount of reduction made to someones salary ?
it surely can not be legal to make a significant reduction when this will have a knock on effect to both their pension and every day life ?
thank you mrs taylor , uk i break even under the current proposals but am incensed by the appalling way staffordshire is treating its staff .
the statistics put out are very misleading and are skewed by , amongst other things , the inclusion of small gains for many part-time staff the figures for who should be converted to full time equivalents to show a more accurate reflection of the position .
a lot of damage has already been done and i find it difficult to envisage goodwill getting back to previous levels at least not for the foreseeable future .
terry edwards , uk as a scc employee , my main concern is that the headline figures given by the county council have been manipulated and are misleading spin .
the percentages of 45 % up , 30 % unchanged and 25 % down refer to ' contracts ' and include part time staff such as dinner ladies and school crossing patroles , many of whom are in the ' up ' group .
so a professional standing to loose up to £ 12,000 is counted against many part time workers who may all be give an extra few pounds in there pay packets .
additionally , my letter indicated that my salery would remain unchanged but that is based on my current pay and by the time the proposals would come into effect next year , i would take a cut so should n't i be one of the ' down ' section ?
this again would not make the story as good as the job evaluation team and their management would like .
however , getting any additional information , other than the official stroy has proved very difficult and i myself have not recieved satisfactory responces to request made under the freedom of information act 2000 .
chris mitchell , uk i consider myself extemely fortunate as my salary under job evaluation will remain unchanged , however i am totally in support of my colleagues who are taking massive pay cuts .
it is not just the people who will be losing who disagree with the present outcome of job evaluation .
the effect on morale is devastating and the county council must understand that service delivery will inevertably be seriously affected .
alan wrench , england my partner and i both work for staffordshire county council .
our combined loss is £ 6000 .
we are expecting our first child in march 2006 and are extremely concerned at how we will cope with mortgage payments and the cost of bringing up a young child .
apart from our own issues i have noticed morale in the office is at an all time low .
the standard of the service that we provide has also suffered .
no one is prepared to go the extra inch to ensure customers are happy anymore .
i hope councillors realise the impact this will have on their constituents .
richard harris , uk in the department where i work , -lrb- development services -rrb- , which deals with highways and planning , 67 % of staff will receive a reduction in their pay - that 's not job evaluation , its an out and out pay cut and its scandalous .
richard , england my current salary is £ 30843 going down to £ 23952 .
i am very disappointed in the way staffordshire county council have dealt with the job evaluation process .
i have only worked for the council for less than 3 years in this current position and i am struggling to see why the remuneration for this job has changed so dramatically the main question for me is how can the council really expect employees to take such a huge pay cut .
this proposal is not only morally incorrect -lrb- i expect more from a local government employer -rrb- but actually is unsustainable by the council .
helen bradley , my salary will fall by £ 5200 .
not only do they propose cutting pay but grades have altered - employees can longer work towards a higher grade .
many who have had a pay rise will not in fact have a job in a year or so !
people working in residential homes -lrb- they are closing -rrb- home carers -lrb- numbers being reduced by at least 50 % -rrb- management do not tell this to the media .
the way that the mr pursey and mr savege are treating their employees is disgraceful - i no longer trust anything they say .
they have destroyed our goodwill in one fell swoop .
they have not arrived at this with the unions and this needs to be exposed .
sue mountford , england after 20 years as a surveyor at british coal i went to leicestershire county council after 10 years as head of planning enforcement we underwent job evaluation in 2002 .
i took a small cut in salary and along with many colleagues including all of the planning enforcement officers i voted with my resignation and relocated to staffordshire county council as team leader responsible for the planning regulation team .
only to be presented 4 years later with a proposal to cut the team salaries by £ 6000 and because of the removal of career grades for established officers and increments for new starters this could be as much as £ 11000 for the team .
how can resolving the injustice of unequal pay be solved by creating even more injustice , at this time of year the people of staffordshire , for whom we all work will see a reduction in service from disillusioned staff and will ultimately express their views at the ballot box .
doug walker , england i work for staffordshire county council and feel the whole process has been dealt with very badly .
if these proposals are implemented the county will be a lot poorer for the people who live here who deserve a good standard of service , i am afraid these will suffer as experienced and devoted staff will leave. nick boot , england at the time of the 1997 single status agreement , the signatory unions and employers had not secured the necessary funding from central government -lrb- unlike the nhs agenda for change -rrb- .
union branches are now left to try and clear up this nationally negotiated idealogical mess at local level and their members -lrb- many of who are female -rrb- are paying the price with significant salary cuts .
anon from birmingham , england these percentage figures -lrb- 45 % up , 25 % down -rrb- are based on contracts , not head-count .
many casuals , p art-timers have multiple contracts .
everyone who sees these figures assume they relate to head-count .
this fact alone warps their meaning .
most of the losers are full-timers losing obscene amounts , as stated .
based on fte -lrb- full-time equivalents -rrb- the losers will outweigh the winners significantly in both head-count and monetary losses .
employees are demanding these figures , but the employer persists in withholding the data and spinning the statistics .
anonymous , england i am one of the very concerned 28.000 employees working for staffordshire county council .
i took part in yesterday 's demonstration which again received a lot of media coverage .
i am still in a state of shock as far as the new pay proposals are concerned and can not believe that as local authority workers the government are prepared to subject us to this .
but what bothers me most at the moment is how this whole job evaluation is coming across in the media .
it is not just the alleged 25 % of workers who stand to loose that are distressed by this proposal it is the entirety of the workforce .
everyone looses there are no clear winners .
all of the grades have been reduced from the top right through to the bottom .
county councillors are not fully aware of what is going on around them for the most part they live in their own little social bubble .
the job evaluation process is far from fair it is discriminatory .
it has thrown up so many inconsistencies and anomalies be beggars belief .
and lastly and probably most importantly is the array of services we provide , most of staffordshire county council employees do more than what is included in our job descriptions , we work long hours and do n't get overtime , we do n't use our flexi time , some of use do n't even claim expenses .
a huge chunck of our work revolves around good will and a can do approach .
good will that is directed at providing the best possible service we can to the public despite staff shortages and financial restraints .
sarah fraser , staffordshire . , england your phone calls ...
i work at staffordshire county council and i am in charge of 25 people .
as of yet i do n't know what my salary will be but i know that the staff that work for me are very upset and de-motivated about their situation .
this is making for the very difficult working day .
anonymous , west midlands as a council tax payer these cuts by staffordshire council for their workers must prove the incompetence of the council .
if they were paying people £ 12 000 over what they say they require now , then why they were paying it for so long time ?
this is just another example of how council tax payers ' money is being wasted .
george , newcastle-under-lyme my daughter is one of those who will have a pay cut .
she is highly qualified and does a great deal of overtime unpaid .
i think that these people are being treated absolutely disgracefully .
this is a policy of the old victorian mine owners where they think they can just come along and cut people 's pay by thousands of pounds .
but nobody thinks what these people will do , where they will find the money for mortgages , clothing , etc .
these people may lose their homes .
they are sitting and crying about it but the authorities do not care .
mrs e. biddle , stafford i 've worked for the staffordshire county council since 1978 and i 'm retiring this christmas .
my wages when i started was £ 4.10 and i am now on £ 5.80 .
where is inflation in 28 years ?
margaret , stafford as far as i 'm concerned council employees are overpaid .
if they think that they can go to the private sector and can earn as much money with gold plated pension at the age of 60 , then let them do so .
if they ca n't then they should accept the proposal put forward .
aaron , walsall i work in the education department of staffordshire county council .
my colleagues and i are all being paid a different amount .
there is no recognition of experience or qualifications .
people who have been working for 12 years are getting pay cut below people who only just started .
we are all disgusted with how we have been treated .
we are being informed about £ 15.000 pay cut by a letter !
anonymous , staffordshire i am a pa to deputy corporate director .
my wage will be dropped by £ 2250 and my line manager 's by £ 7500 .
i do n't understand where my career structure has gone after 19 years of service .
it does n't seem fair at all !
tracey , stafford looking at the road alterations around our area i think that all the planers involved must be overpaid judging by the standard of the work they do .
if £ 10.000 can be a reduction in salary then what the original salaries are like ?
william , gloucester i work for the staffordshire county council and my salary will be cut .
i am disgusted that no apology has been given to us from your guest .
steve , staffordshire i work for the staffordshire county council and under the job evaluation scheme i 've been classified as one of the winners .
however , for the next 3 years i will not receive any pay increase , no career progression .
as a qualified solicitor it was my choice to work for local government but i do have doubts now .
anonymous , staffordshire i 've worked for the council for 20 years and i 'm disgusted with the way i 've been treated .
julie , stoke-on-trent i think that the wage structures that the council implemented over the years , they are responsible for the problems that have been created .
mr davis , walsall i am an employee of staffordshire county council .
my job is a unique , technical post .
i was employed in march this year and nobody mentioned any job evaluation scheme back then .
i think the county council will loose lots of qualified and devoted staff ..
mark , stoke-on-trent this situation is an absolute disgrace .
if there are two people on the same job , the lower one should be brought up to the higher one .
i would definitely support the strike .

when raf stafford was due to close the county council produced statistics to show the detrimental economic effect this would have to stafford borough .
with a sizeable proportion of the 7,000 people affected living and working in the area the impact to both the economy of the borough and to house prices could be severe .
has anyone called for an economic assessment ?
ed hooper , staffordshire when job evaluation is used in the private sector , which is n't that common , it is n't usually undertaken with the aim of imposing widespread and swingeing pay cuts ; job evaluation is n't scientific or infallible .
the margin of error means that many jobs are inappropriately downgraded ; council workers ' pay has dropped 20 % relative to pay in the wider economy since parity was last established by comparability in 1979 .
many essential workers already earn less than their private sector equivalents and plan to leave local government when the pay cuts are imposed ; the average council worker 's pension is £ 6,000 when the average pension in the wider economy is £ 11,000 ; j e isacon , england my salary will be going down 35 % to £ 16137 .
i am married with two children and a mortgage .
how will we survive this ?
i 'm appalled by the arrogant attitude of mr savege .
does he realise that if he gets his way there will be huge council tax rises as it will cost the county council a lot more to contract work out when we have all left the county council !
steve , england mr. savege stated that this process was to enable people -lrb- male / female -rrb- to be paid the same for doing the same job - if this is the case why then have people , who are doing identical jobs , been graded differently .
could it be because the county council do n't realise that the schemes they are using are seriously flawed .
as for the so called apology it is too late the damage has been done .
wendy , england i have worked for nearly 25 years for staffordshire county council in libraries and with experience and competitive interview gained small promotions which have now been devalued and degraded to be rendered meaningless .
i am now set to receive just £ 15,000 ... a drop of £ 3000 .
it seems the pay of the low paid is just being redistributed to other low paid workers and the reality is that a huge chasm is opening up between us and those like mr savege at the top of the tree who give themselves hefty payrises .
we have all been given a huge slap in the face .
cecile harrison , england job evaluation in staffordshire will equate to job migration .
employees are very upset and distressed with the way that this has been handled by the hr department , even those who have allegedly had a pay rise are supporting those against job evaluation .
as for equal pay for equal jobs , this is a nonsense .
my pay will stay the same as will another collegues who does the same job as myself .
this job evaluation is a cost cutting exercise which is being pushed through with the restructure to hide job losses and reduce the need for redundency pay , as many will seek to leave the department .
mandy harrison , england whilst a degree of sympathy has to go out to those that will lose out should the proposed pay structure be implemented following the je process , it is a certainty that zero regard will have been given by such individuals for those that have been paid disproportionately for doing a job requiring the same or comparable skills -in many cases for years .
it would be foolish and ignorant to assume the fact not a single comment on this web site supporting the process can be seen , is down to a purely negative reaction across the board .
there is certainly an element of people that have been underpaid for years , that having now had this recognised , feel embarrassed to claim what is rightfully theirs for fear of reprisals and that is wrong .
anon , england the impression i get is that the council are using the excuse of job evaluation to " fix " something that " ai n't broke " .
the amount paid by the council to an employee will always be determined largely by market forces , and no amount of " fixing " by the powers that be , will ever change this .
as margaret thatcher once said " you ca n't buck the market " .
job evaluation has suggested that almost 20,000 employees ' salaries are in error .
well , given a choice between ' the market ' and job evaluation , i would choose ' the market ' every time as the more accurate and fairer setter of employees salaries .
-lrb- btw , my salary 's down by £ 5k or 15 % . -rrb-
mike hinton , uk i am writing to express my disgust at the whole job evaluation scheme with is affecting me and thousands of my hard working colleagues .
i do not know how the county council expects the departments to work effectively when they know they can not pay their mortgage or feed their children .
it is a terrifying prospect .
although i did not see your programme , i thank you for bringing it to the attention of the wider public. paul rochfort , england in response to aaron and mark dean - it has been clearly proven that council staff across the country are paid no where near market levels for the jobs they do .
council staff work long hours to provide you the tax payer with the services you take for granted .
how would you like to receive a faceless side of a4 with minimal information on , telling you that " oops , sorry , you 'll have to take a £ 10,000 pay cut " ?
the county has continually hidden the truth about this proposal behind spin and more rhetoric - even to go on record as saying " our staff are our greatest asset " in response to the march last thursday ! !
savage has now gone on national tv to say " 45 % of staff go up " .
wrong ! ! ! 45 % of contracts go up , with alot of people in the posts being increased having more than 1 contract .
it is pure spin and half truthes to win over the media and the public .
45 % up by £ 500 does not equal 25 % down on average by £ 4000 .
you do the maths and tell me how this is not a cost cutting ! exercise .
richard pearce , jim savege had the chance live on television to apologise to the thousands upon thousands of council workers for who this job evaluation has caused demoralisation and distress .
but he chose not to .
council workers are the back bone to many front line services , most of those hardest hit are school support staff , including those who have worked hours upon hours of unpiad overtime as a good will gesture , including those who have worked tirelessly giving years and years continual service to the county .
so the council ca n't even give the smallest gesture of an apology , no wonder there is talk of a strike ! ! ! !
rob , england the day after all the support staff received this bombshell letter on 10 november , the teachers all received a mailout from the nut urging them to take action re ' reducing teachers workload ' - i 'm sure the teachers would n't take a 11-16 % pay cut , they would walk out , so why do staffordshire county council think they can do this to support staff ?
incredible !
so much for building a career to have the last three years performance progression wiped out in one move .
how to demoralise a whole section of the workforce with one blow ! fed up secretary , uk the proposed pay cuts for staffordshire county council employees have caused distress and anguish to people across all departments .
i am astounded that an organisation that employs 28,000 people has not set up a counselling service or a debt helpline .
instead , the booklet that was distributed with the letters lists the numbers of the citizen 's advice bureau , a clear indication that the council were aware of the stress and anxiety the proposed pay model was likely to cause .
olwen johnson , stafford , uk i earn £ 14523 per year as a library assistant at your library i work long hours often early mornings one evening a week till seven and saturday .
i 'm set to lose £ 400 per year so maybe i 'm one the lucky ones but what hurts the most is that your library staff score the the lowest on the je evaulation forms even the cleaners have more knowledge than your library staff who often spend time teaching people how to use computers and dealing bus and train timetable enquires .
all we want is a fair days money for a fair days work and to be shown a little repsect from ssc .
anon uk after 22 years service my salary will fall from £ 18,000 to £ 14,000 taking me back to where i was in 1997 .
i 'm single and disabled and would have to sell my home .
perhaps i should just live on the state ?
ed hooper , uk i would like to reply to those who think that county council workers are overpaid by giving a few examples of the proposed cuts .
i can understand that a £ 10,000 pay cut implies that the original salary is generous , but in fact this is a huge proportion of the individuals ' salaries , which is why this is so painful .
for example one of my colleagues would drop from £ 25,000 to £ 14,000 .
another would drop from £ 14,500 to £ 12,700 .
a couple of my colleagues would drop from £ 17,900 to £ 14,100 .
w. timothy , uk having analysed the spreadsheets supplied by the council , it does indeed seem that the " rises amount to no more than a few pounds in many cases , while the cuts are huge . "
sonia deol used those words to jim savege on tv , he effectively ignored the question , presumably because he had no answer and it gives the cost-cutting game away .
geoff , uk any staff who 's pay remains unchanged under the job evaluation and single status proposals , face the prospect of having no opportunity to get a pay rise in future because the top of the pay scale has been adjusted downwards .
this will have a similar impact on affected staff to the proposed pay cuts .
the effect of this -lrb- if implemented -rrb- will be to further negatively impact recruitment and retention which will already have been made virtually impossible for key staff particularly ict staff by the reduction in salaries !
yours , chris snow rugeley , staffs .
chris snow , uk mr savege ¿ s point that many people doing the same jobs are on different salaries , in response : 1 .
the law lords have ruled that different levels of pay are quite acceptable provided the reason for that difference is not sexual discrimination .
2 .
the employer has set these contracts up many in the last 10 years without properly evaluating them at the beginning , why should the employee pay for the employers mistakes ? 3 .
where was this sense of duty , when it came to employing people in the last 10 years and where is it now ?
this is a cynical ploy , to reduce staff numbers by getting them to leave so that the authority wo n't have to pay redundancies , which are already established as part of an ongoing review .
it might be worth asking him if he and the rest of the senior management team still think they have the confidence of the workforce ?
finally , if as stated this is a starting point for negotiation , why are cabinet being asked to make a decision on this in january , that is not consultation , but dictatorship , they could have consulted without setting up cabinet to decide on this ¿ .
p butler , uk i 'm a council worker and am set to lose over £ 4,000 .
having just watched your programme , i was astounded to hear jim savege 's comments .
i liked the way he avoided having to apologise for the upset and worry this process is causing .
you should have asked him about the £ 20,000 pay rise himself and the other directors have awarded themselves .
i 'm even more worried now as i received a letter on saturday from my mortgage lender saying from 1 january my mortgage will increase .
can things get any worse ?
this is making me ill .
mrs j , staffordshire i am writing with regard to the implementation of job evaluation at staffordshire county council , as an employee of some 25 years .
when the scheme was first introduced some 4 years ago , the principles and procedures were accepted by staff as a fair means to achieve parity of salaries across local authorities .
in retrospect , this now seems unquestioningly naive .
we have been subjected to a kafka-esque situation in which we were required to sign off the assessment of our jobs without knowledge of the scoring procedure , and before the pay model was determined .
sheila penfold , england i am senior science technician in a large secondary school .
i have worked in quality control laboratories in industry , have a degree in biology and environmental studies and have spent the last nine years working as a technician in schools , the last four years as senior technician .
my letter regarding the outcome of job evaluation put me on the same grade and salary as the other technicians , a drop of £ 1000 , admittedly not a huge reduction compared to many other workers in staffordshire , but this will mean i will have to sell my house and move to a smaller , cheaper property as i can not afford to pay bills such as council tax on the proposed new salary .
kathleen toms , i have been employed by staffordshire county council at the moorlands vi form centre as the receptionist for the past eight years .
i have been an extremely hard working , loyal member of staff who has always done my best for the centre .
the moorlands is quite unique as the vi form for cheadle high school , painsley catholic college and moorside high school , so we have a number of bosses and are very often pulled in all directions trying to please .
i am the second longest serving member of staff at the vi form and one of the lowest paid .
for at least the last six years i have been on the same salary , the top of scale 2 with nowhere to progress to career wise or salary wise .
when i asked about a pay rise about three years ago i was told that due to job evaluation being implemented i had to wait for the results of that , so i have waited and waited and waited only to be told that i am not even worth the money i am receiving and i am probably going to have a pay cut ! !
i am going from the top of scale 2 to the top of grade 3 , this puts me in exactly the same position i was in but for less pay ! !
how does this make sense ?
the information received by many was distressing and totally demoralising .
staff who have served the county for many years went home on black friday feeling undervalued and insulted by the proposals .
mrs jane spooner , cheadle , staffordshire how can the job evaluation board who set my salary 18 months ago now cut my salary by £ 3700 , did they get it wrong then ?
of the 45 % who are getting rises how many are part time cleaners , dinner ladies , i do not mention these to berate these important positions but to make the point that the rises are pennies for staff who work part time , the cuts however are huge on full time staff who certainly in my own case have a massive amount of responsibilty , to the 1400 pupils in our high school .
our own head who fully supports us , has done his sums , and after giving out the rises ancuts now has £ 22,000 left .
ian mirams , uk both of us work for staffordshire county council and both our salaries have been cut .
we are very angry about this , i bet jim savage has not taken a cut in his salary .
also for all the people who think we are overpaid , should try working for the council !
i think they would feel different .
lynn and trev phillips , england i am a staffordshire county council worker .
i undertake legal child protection work on behalf of social services .
i have been informed of a proposed pay cut of £ 5000 .
this is an insult to my professionalism and sustained commitment shown on behalf of theis authority over fifteen years .
je is a back door route to cutting salary costs .
the communication of the proposals , has a stroke devastated the morale of staff who feel a sense of betrayal. anthony gannon , uk i am appalled by the proposed salary cuts .
we do n't want an apology from jim savege .
we want an acknowledgement from nigel pursey that staffs cc has got it wrong !
it seems that schools have been the hardest hit in salary cuts .
are staffs cc are saying that the heads and governors have got it wrong with the salaries they give to support staff ?
how do you expect to recruit and retain quality support staff in schools under these proposed pay cuts ?
we provide a valuable support service within our school .
we are totally demoralised and devalued .
this is felt throughout our school and affects teaching staff , students , teaching & learning and ultimately results .
sara massey -lrb- learning centre manager , de ferrers specialist technology college , burton -rrb- why do we continueto put council run activities into private management to save money as council run facilities seem to be run for the employees and not the public !
bernard broadhurst , staffordshire i work at staffordshire county council as a personal assistant and after fifteen years service my salary has been cut by £ 4,500k a year .
to watch such a smug interview by mr jim savage has simply added fuel to the fire of the anger i feel for him and for staffordshire county council as a whole .
they are treating their staff with utter contempt and i feel the interview only proved to show the ¿ holier than thou ¿ attitude which is currently being shown to loyal employees .
there is no way the man will apologise to his staff ¿ let ¿ s face it he is in a job that is paying thousands of pounds more than any of us ¿ has his job been evaluated ?
somehow i think not .
daphne sharp , the cc fails to advise you that the 45 % of employees it keeps saying are getting a pay rise are in fact 45 % of contracts , not people .
this is because a lot of these people are so poorly paid they have to have 2 or 3 jobs to make ends meet .
this cc is morally corrupt and should not be allowed to get away with destroying people 's lives in this way.also this labour government will be very badly hit as many traditional labour voters will not vote for them at the naxt election .
gordon brown needs to do something about this very quickly before it is too late.please do not mention my name in respect of this issue as i do fear recriminations anon , uk , staffordshire re-evaluation of council job descriptions .
the question of salary / wage equalisation will obviously pose many problems , particularly for those taking cuts in the proportions publicised .
however , there is one important question to be answered as a forerunner to the debate : " how will those involved in planning and implementing the proposals be affected " particularly senior executives and top administration ?
they should precede any comments , interviews or discussions with this information .
let them demonstrate how they will be part of the suffering .
les cooper , pensioners ' campaigner uk i am pa to a senior manager at staffordshire county council .
i have been down graded and stand to lose £ 2,000 per annum .
i recently attended a long service award ceremony with a colleague who has worked as a pa for 25 years , a week later she was downgraded and her salary would be reduced by £ 4,000 per annum .
a fitting reward for loyal service !
jim savege said that some people are doing the same jobs for different pay - this may be , but some people have more experience and i for one would expect a long serving member of staff to earn more money .
we have not been able to find many colleagues who will benefit , those whose salaries will increase will also be subject to no progression in the years to come and will therefore ultimately lose out .
when i signed my contract of employment i was happy to work for the salary offered i did not expect the contract to be broken .
we have all been demoralised by the whole process and feel that our hard work and loyalty are of no value .
freda green freda green , england many people have not even had a copy of their job over view , how is this consultation ? john , uk on the issue of single status in staffordshire , as it concerns equal pay , why does it not affect all levels of staff ie the senior management such as assistant directors and above ?
this is obviously only equal pay targeting the actual workers and is not aimed at the decision makers enforcing the policy !
local authority employee , england one point that the show did not cover was the real effects of the pay cuts , quoted as a percentage of real-salaries , afterall , a £ 10,000 pay cut will seam trivial to the rate payers if they also assume a salary of £ 100,0000 .
the view might change if the show had quoted a 40 % pay cut instead , for a job role which is already under paid when compared to the salary of the teachers who did the role , prior to the govermeents ' teacher work force remodelling ' programme .
it was also interesting that mr. savege was using percentages to justify the pay rises , but was not countered in a percentage manner by the interviewer .
leigh , uk i do n't know of any one who has their wages put up .
however all of my collegues in it have been cut up to £ 10,000 .
di brown , england i work for dudley council and we are at present going through the initial stages of this single status but we will have to wait until next year for the decisions .
i will be very interested to see what happens in staffordshire and all the other local councils .
we work very hard and deserve a decent days pay .
barry knowles , dudley perhaps you might like to ask mr savege this question : the explanatory booklet distributed to staff , with the accompanying job evaluation letter , states that : " through the introduction of an element of ' contribution - related pay ' , we can ensure that pay and grading review arrangements support and encourage all employees to achieve their full potential " .
their current proposal will put me back to a salary level that i had previously strived hard to reach some 5 years ago .
how does this help me continue to try and achieve my full potential ?
jeff stevens do n't be fooled by jim savege 's clever words and percentages .
even the 40 % of people who he claims will stay the same under the proposals are in fact losing money .
staffordshire county council is using the equality issue to save costs not to equalise pay ! !
loser2 , uk re the council cuts .
i work for the council and face a cut of £ 4,000 .
what i would like the council to clarify is the actual scale of the increases - jim quoted one person going up by £ 12k - i am not aware of any rises other than people possibly going up by a few hundred pounds per year- not balanced out by the thousands i and many many others stand to lose .
also - would like to point out the potential impact on local businesses - if my pay is cut for example i in turn will spend less in local shops and businesses .
joanne sherratt , england re - single status in midlands local authority it is unacceptable & immoral to cut the pay of professional white collar staff , using a crude & flawed job evaluation pay model , in order to fund pay rises for manual groups of workers .
staffordshire council will lose staff & staff good will through this bungled exercise andrew frank , england the percentage of staff who have had an increase in pay are in general part time workers and the increase is a couple of pounds a week .
in the trading standards department the lower grade of staff have seen a cut in pay while the highest grade have seen an increase .
all have seen a cap put on acreer progression .
how can this be equality of pay mark jurkiewicz , stafford uk wondered if your guest from hr on the council this morning is also taking a pay cut joe , uk my girlfriend works for the council and is to lose £ 4,500 from her salary .
what jim savege failed to mention is that all the top bosses have vetoed their salaries so they are not affected by the single salary status .
jobs for the boys or what ?
jes smart , stafford england council workers are already overpaid in my view and i would hate to pay more council tax to fund more money in their pay packet .
mark dean , midlands , uk interesting that again the message that 45 % of people are going up .
unfortunatly it would appear that these statistics are based on contracts not individuals .
a lot of staff have more than one contract , and as such some people are gaining as little as 30 pounds on one contract but losing thousands on the other .
if the council accepts that they have been under paying some staff then they should n't steal the money back from " their most valuable asset " as they put it .
the statistics are not worth the paper they are printed on untill all the base information / data is made available .
mark , england poor public sector workers .
welcome to the real world !
this kind of thing happens in the private sector all the time and we do n't have secure pensions to look forward to ! !
if you do n't like it , get another job .
richard , uk my husband also works for a local authority which is undergoing the same process , we would like to know is there any legal limit on the amount of reduction made to someones salary ?
it surely can not be legal to make a significant reduction when this will have a knock on effect to both their pension and every day life ?
thank you mrs taylor , uk i break even under the current proposals but am incensed by the appalling way staffordshire is treating its staff .
the statistics put out are very misleading and are skewed by , amongst other things , the inclusion of small gains for many part-time staff the figures for who should be converted to full time equivalents to show a more accurate reflection of the position .
a lot of damage has already been done and i find it difficult to envisage goodwill getting back to previous levels at least not for the foreseeable future .
terry edwards , uk as a scc employee , my main concern is that the headline figures given by the county council have been manipulated and are misleading spin .
the percentages of 45 % up , 30 % unchanged and 25 % down refer to ' contracts ' and include part time staff such as dinner ladies and school crossing patroles , many of whom are in the ' up ' group .
so a professional standing to loose up to £ 12,000 is counted against many part time workers who may all be give an extra few pounds in there pay packets .
additionally , my letter indicated that my salery would remain unchanged but that is based on my current pay and by the time the proposals would come into effect next year , i would take a cut so should n't i be one of the ' down ' section ?
this again would not make the story as good as the job evaluation team and their management would like .
however , getting any additional information , other than the official stroy has proved very difficult and i myself have not recieved satisfactory responces to request made under the freedom of information act 2000 .
chris mitchell , uk i consider myself extemely fortunate as my salary under job evaluation will remain unchanged , however i am totally in support of my colleagues who are taking massive pay cuts .
it is not just the people who will be losing who disagree with the present outcome of job evaluation .
the effect on morale is devastating and the county council must understand that service delivery will inevertably be seriously affected .
alan wrench , england my partner and i both work for staffordshire county council .
our combined loss is £ 6000 .
we are expecting our first child in march 2006 and are extremely concerned at how we will cope with mortgage payments and the cost of bringing up a young child .
apart from our own issues i have noticed morale in the office is at an all time low .
the standard of the service that we provide has also suffered .
no one is prepared to go the extra inch to ensure customers are happy anymore .
i hope councillors realise the impact this will have on their constituents .
richard harris , uk in the department where i work , -lrb- development services -rrb- , which deals with highways and planning , 67 % of staff will receive a reduction in their pay - that 's not job evaluation , its an out and out pay cut and its scandalous .
richard , england my current salary is £ 30843 going down to £ 23952 .
i am very disappointed in the way staffordshire county council have dealt with the job evaluation process .
i have only worked for the council for less than 3 years in this current position and i am struggling to see why the remuneration for this job has changed so dramatically the main question for me is how can the council really expect employees to take such a huge pay cut .
this proposal is not only morally incorrect -lrb- i expect more from a local government employer -rrb- but actually is unsustainable by the council .
helen bradley , my salary will fall by £ 5200 .
not only do they propose cutting pay but grades have altered - employees can longer work towards a higher grade .
many who have had a pay rise will not in fact have a job in a year or so !
people working in residential homes -lrb- they are closing -rrb- home carers -lrb- numbers being reduced by at least 50 % -rrb- management do not tell this to the media .
the way that the mr pursey and mr savege are treating their employees is disgraceful - i no longer trust anything they say .
they have destroyed our goodwill in one fell swoop .
they have not arrived at this with the unions and this needs to be exposed .
sue mountford , england after 20 years as a surveyor at british coal i went to leicestershire county council after 10 years as head of planning enforcement we underwent job evaluation in 2002 .
i took a small cut in salary and along with many colleagues including all of the planning enforcement officers i voted with my resignation and relocated to staffordshire county council as team leader responsible for the planning regulation team .
only to be presented 4 years later with a proposal to cut the team salaries by £ 6000 and because of the removal of career grades for established officers and increments for new starters this could be as much as £ 11000 for the team .
how can resolving the injustice of unequal pay be solved by creating even more injustice , at this time of year the people of staffordshire , for whom we all work will see a reduction in service from disillusioned staff and will ultimately express their views at the ballot box .
doug walker , england i work for staffordshire county council and feel the whole process has been dealt with very badly .
if these proposals are implemented the county will be a lot poorer for the people who live here who deserve a good standard of service , i am afraid these will suffer as experienced and devoted staff will leave. nick boot , england at the time of the 1997 single status agreement , the signatory unions and employers had not secured the necessary funding from central government -lrb- unlike the nhs agenda for change -rrb- .
union branches are now left to try and clear up this nationally negotiated idealogical mess at local level and their members -lrb- many of who are female -rrb- are paying the price with significant salary cuts .
anon from birmingham , england these percentage figures -lrb- 45 % up , 25 % down -rrb- are based on contracts , not head-count .
many casuals , p art-timers have multiple contracts .
everyone who sees these figures assume they relate to head-count .
this fact alone warps their meaning .
most of the losers are full-timers losing obscene amounts , as stated .
based on fte -lrb- full-time equivalents -rrb- the losers will outweigh the winners significantly in both head-count and monetary losses .
employees are demanding these figures , but the employer persists in withholding the data and spinning the statistics .
anonymous , england i am one of the very concerned 28.000 employees working for staffordshire county council .
i took part in yesterday 's demonstration which again received a lot of media coverage .
i am still in a state of shock as far as the new pay proposals are concerned and can not believe that as local authority workers the government are prepared to subject us to this .
but what bothers me most at the moment is how this whole job evaluation is coming across in the media .
it is not just the alleged 25 % of workers who stand to loose that are distressed by this proposal it is the entirety of the workforce .
everyone looses there are no clear winners .
all of the grades have been reduced from the top right through to the bottom .
county councillors are not fully aware of what is going on around them for the most part they live in their own little social bubble .
the job evaluation process is far from fair it is discriminatory .
it has thrown up so many inconsistencies and anomalies be beggars belief .
and lastly and probably most importantly is the array of services we provide , most of staffordshire county council employees do more than what is included in our job descriptions , we work long hours and do n't get overtime , we do n't use our flexi time , some of use do n't even claim expenses .
a huge chunck of our work revolves around good will and a can do approach .
good will that is directed at providing the best possible service we can to the public despite staff shortages and financial restraints .
sarah fraser , staffordshire . , england your phone calls ...
i work at staffordshire county council and i am in charge of 25 people .
as of yet i do n't know what my salary will be but i know that the staff that work for me are very upset and de-motivated about their situation .
this is making for the very difficult working day .
anonymous , west midlands as a council tax payer these cuts by staffordshire council for their workers must prove the incompetence of the council .
if they were paying people £ 12 000 over what they say they require now , then why they were paying it for so long time ?
this is just another example of how council tax payers ' money is being wasted .
george , newcastle-under-lyme my daughter is one of those who will have a pay cut .
she is highly qualified and does a great deal of overtime unpaid .
i think that these people are being treated absolutely disgracefully .
this is a policy of the old victorian mine owners where they think they can just come along and cut people 's pay by thousands of pounds .
but nobody thinks what these people will do , where they will find the money for mortgages , clothing , etc .
these people may lose their homes .
they are sitting and crying about it but the authorities do not care .
mrs e. biddle , stafford i 've worked for the staffordshire county council since 1978 and i 'm retiring this christmas .
my wages when i started was £ 4.10 and i am now on £ 5.80 .
where is inflation in 28 years ?
margaret , stafford as far as i 'm concerned council employees are overpaid .
if they think that they can go to the private sector and can earn as much money with gold plated pension at the age of 60 , then let them do so .
if they ca n't then they should accept the proposal put forward .
aaron , walsall i work in the education department of staffordshire county council .
my colleagues and i are all being paid a different amount .
there is no recognition of experience or qualifications .
people who have been working for 12 years are getting pay cut below people who only just started .
we are all disgusted with how we have been treated .
we are being informed about £ 15.000 pay cut by a letter !
anonymous , staffordshire i am a pa to deputy corporate director .
my wage will be dropped by £ 2250 and my line manager 's by £ 7500 .
i do n't understand where my career structure has gone after 19 years of service .
it does n't seem fair at all !
tracey , stafford looking at the road alterations around our area i think that all the planers involved must be overpaid judging by the standard of the work they do .
if £ 10.000 can be a reduction in salary then what the original salaries are like ?
william , gloucester i work for the staffordshire county council and my salary will be cut .
i am disgusted that no apology has been given to us from your guest .
steve , staffordshire i work for the staffordshire county council and under the job evaluation scheme i 've been classified as one of the winners .
however , for the next 3 years i will not receive any pay increase , no career progression .
as a qualified solicitor it was my choice to work for local government but i do have doubts now .
anonymous , staffordshire i 've worked for the council for 20 years and i 'm disgusted with the way i 've been treated .
julie , stoke-on-trent i think that the wage structures that the council implemented over the years , they are responsible for the problems that have been created .
mr davis , walsall i am an employee of staffordshire county council .
my job is a unique , technical post .
i was employed in march this year and nobody mentioned any job evaluation scheme back then .
i think the county council will loose lots of qualified and devoted staff ..
mark , stoke-on-trent this situation is an absolute disgrace .
if there are two people on the same job , the lower one should be brought up to the higher one .
i would definitely support the strike .

when raf stafford was due to close the county council produced statistics to show the detrimental economic effect this would have to stafford borough .
with a sizeable proportion of the 7,000 people affected living and working in the area the impact to both the economy of the borough and to house prices could be severe .
has anyone called for an economic assessment ?
ed hooper , staffordshire when job evaluation is used in the private sector , which is n't that common , it is n't usually undertaken with the aim of imposing widespread and swingeing pay cuts ; job evaluation is n't scientific or infallible .
the margin of error means that many jobs are inappropriately downgraded ; council workers ' pay has dropped 20 % relative to pay in the wider economy since parity was last established by comparability in 1979 .
many essential workers already earn less than their private sector equivalents and plan to leave local government when the pay cuts are imposed ; the average council worker 's pension is £ 6,000 when the average pension in the wider economy is £ 11,000 ; j e isacon , england my salary will be going down 35 % to £ 16137 .
i am married with two children and a mortgage .
how will we survive this ?
i 'm appalled by the arrogant attitude of mr savege .
does he realise that if he gets his way there will be huge council tax rises as it will cost the county council a lot more to contract work out when we have all left the county council !
steve , england mr. savege stated that this process was to enable people -lrb- male / female -rrb- to be paid the same for doing the same job - if this is the case why then have people , who are doing identical jobs , been graded differently .
could it be because the county council do n't realise that the schemes they are using are seriously flawed .
as for the so called apology it is too late the damage has been done .
wendy , england i have worked for nearly 25 years for staffordshire county council in libraries and with experience and competitive interview gained small promotions which have now been devalued and degraded to be rendered meaningless .
i am now set to receive just £ 15,000 ... a drop of £ 3000 .
it seems the pay of the low paid is just being redistributed to other low paid workers and the reality is that a huge chasm is opening up between us and those like mr savege at the top of the tree who give themselves hefty payrises .
we have all been given a huge slap in the face .
cecile harrison , england job evaluation in staffordshire will equate to job migration .
employees are very upset and distressed with the way that this has been handled by the hr department , even those who have allegedly had a pay rise are supporting those against job evaluation .
as for equal pay for equal jobs , this is a nonsense .
my pay will stay the same as will another collegues who does the same job as myself .
this job evaluation is a cost cutting exercise which is being pushed through with the restructure to hide job losses and reduce the need for redundency pay , as many will seek to leave the department .
mandy harrison , england whilst a degree of sympathy has to go out to those that will lose out should the proposed pay structure be implemented following the je process , it is a certainty that zero regard will have been given by such individuals for those that have been paid disproportionately for doing a job requiring the same or comparable skills -in many cases for years .
it would be foolish and ignorant to assume the fact not a single comment on this web site supporting the process can be seen , is down to a purely negative reaction across the board .
there is certainly an element of people that have been underpaid for years , that having now had this recognised , feel embarrassed to claim what is rightfully theirs for fear of reprisals and that is wrong .
anon , england the impression i get is that the council are using the excuse of job evaluation to " fix " something that " ai n't broke " .
the amount paid by the council to an employee will always be determined largely by market forces , and no amount of " fixing " by the powers that be , will ever change this .
as margaret thatcher once said " you ca n't buck the market " .
job evaluation has suggested that almost 20,000 employees ' salaries are in error .
well , given a choice between ' the market ' and job evaluation , i would choose ' the market ' every time as the more accurate and fairer setter of employees salaries .
-lrb- btw , my salary 's down by £ 5k or 15 % . -rrb-
mike hinton , uk i am writing to express my disgust at the whole job evaluation scheme with is affecting me and thousands of my hard working colleagues .
i do not know how the county council expects the departments to work effectively when they know they can not pay their mortgage or feed their children .
it is a terrifying prospect .
although i did not see your programme , i thank you for bringing it to the attention of the wider public. paul rochfort , england in response to aaron and mark dean - it has been clearly proven that council staff across the country are paid no where near market levels for the jobs they do .
council staff work long hours to provide you the tax payer with the services you take for granted .
how would you like to receive a faceless side of a4 with minimal information on , telling you that " oops , sorry , you 'll have to take a £ 10,000 pay cut " ?
the county has continually hidden the truth about this proposal behind spin and more rhetoric - even to go on record as saying " our staff are our greatest asset " in response to the march last thursday ! !
savage has now gone on national tv to say " 45 % of staff go up " .
wrong ! ! ! 45 % of contracts go up , with alot of people in the posts being increased having more than 1 contract .
it is pure spin and half truthes to win over the media and the public .
45 % up by £ 500 does not equal 25 % down on average by £ 4000 .
you do the maths and tell me how this is not a cost cutting ! exercise .
richard pearce , jim savege had the chance live on television to apologise to the thousands upon thousands of council workers for who this job evaluation has caused demoralisation and distress .
but he chose not to .
council workers are the back bone to many front line services , most of those hardest hit are school support staff , including those who have worked hours upon hours of unpiad overtime as a good will gesture , including those who have worked tirelessly giving years and years continual service to the county .
so the council ca n't even give the smallest gesture of an apology , no wonder there is talk of a strike ! ! ! !
rob , england the day after all the support staff received this bombshell letter on 10 november , the teachers all received a mailout from the nut urging them to take action re ' reducing teachers workload ' - i 'm sure the teachers would n't take a 11-16 % pay cut , they would walk out , so why do staffordshire county council think they can do this to support staff ?
incredible !
so much for building a career to have the last three years performance progression wiped out in one move .
how to demoralise a whole section of the workforce with one blow ! fed up secretary , uk the proposed pay cuts for staffordshire county council employees have caused distress and anguish to people across all departments .
i am astounded that an organisation that employs 28,000 people has not set up a counselling service or a debt helpline .
instead , the booklet that was distributed with the letters lists the numbers of the citizen 's advice bureau , a clear indication that the council were aware of the stress and anxiety the proposed pay model was likely to cause .
olwen johnson , stafford , uk i earn £ 14523 per year as a library assistant at your library i work long hours often early mornings one evening a week till seven and saturday .
i 'm set to lose £ 400 per year so maybe i 'm one the lucky ones but what hurts the most is that your library staff score the the lowest on the je evaulation forms even the cleaners have more knowledge than your library staff who often spend time teaching people how to use computers and dealing bus and train timetable enquires .
all we want is a fair days money for a fair days work and to be shown a little repsect from ssc .
anon uk after 22 years service my salary will fall from £ 18,000 to £ 14,000 taking me back to where i was in 1997 .
i 'm single and disabled and would have to sell my home .
perhaps i should just live on the state ?
ed hooper , uk i would like to reply to those who think that county council workers are overpaid by giving a few examples of the proposed cuts .
i can understand that a £ 10,000 pay cut implies that the original salary is generous , but in fact this is a huge proportion of the individuals ' salaries , which is why this is so painful .
for example one of my colleagues would drop from £ 25,000 to £ 14,000 .
another would drop from £ 14,500 to £ 12,700 .
a couple of my colleagues would drop from £ 17,900 to £ 14,100 .
w. timothy , uk having analysed the spreadsheets supplied by the council , it does indeed seem that the " rises amount to no more than a few pounds in many cases , while the cuts are huge . "
sonia deol used those words to jim savege on tv , he effectively ignored the question , presumably because he had no answer and it gives the cost-cutting game away .
geoff , uk any staff who 's pay remains unchanged under the job evaluation and single status proposals , face the prospect of having no opportunity to get a pay rise in future because the top of the pay scale has been adjusted downwards .
this will have a similar impact on affected staff to the proposed pay cuts .
the effect of this -lrb- if implemented -rrb- will be to further negatively impact recruitment and retention which will already have been made virtually impossible for key staff particularly ict staff by the reduction in salaries !
yours , chris snow rugeley , staffs .
chris snow , uk mr savege ¿ s point that many people doing the same jobs are on different salaries , in response : 1 .
the law lords have ruled that different levels of pay are quite acceptable provided the reason for that difference is not sexual discrimination .
2 .
the employer has set these contracts up many in the last 10 years without properly evaluating them at the beginning , why should the employee pay for the employers mistakes ? 3 .
where was this sense of duty , when it came to employing people in the last 10 years and where is it now ?
this is a cynical ploy , to reduce staff numbers by getting them to leave so that the authority wo n't have to pay redundancies , which are already established as part of an ongoing review .
it might be worth asking him if he and the rest of the senior management team still think they have the confidence of the workforce ?
finally , if as stated this is a starting point for negotiation , why are cabinet being asked to make a decision on this in january , that is not consultation , but dictatorship , they could have consulted without setting up cabinet to decide on this ¿ .
p butler , uk i 'm a council worker and am set to lose over £ 4,000 .
having just watched your programme , i was astounded to hear jim savege 's comments .
i liked the way he avoided having to apologise for the upset and worry this process is causing .
you should have asked him about the £ 20,000 pay rise himself and the other directors have awarded themselves .
i 'm even more worried now as i received a letter on saturday from my mortgage lender saying from 1 january my mortgage will increase .
can things get any worse ?
this is making me ill .
mrs j , staffordshire i am writing with regard to the implementation of job evaluation at staffordshire county council , as an employee of some 25 years .
when the scheme was first introduced some 4 years ago , the principles and procedures were accepted by staff as a fair means to achieve parity of salaries across local authorities .
in retrospect , this now seems unquestioningly naive .
we have been subjected to a kafka-esque situation in which we were required to sign off the assessment of our jobs without knowledge of the scoring procedure , and before the pay model was determined .
sheila penfold , england i am senior science technician in a large secondary school .
i have worked in quality control laboratories in industry , have a degree in biology and environmental studies and have spent the last nine years working as a technician in schools , the last four years as senior technician .
my letter regarding the outcome of job evaluation put me on the same grade and salary as the other technicians , a drop of £ 1000 , admittedly not a huge reduction compared to many other workers in staffordshire , but this will mean i will have to sell my house and move to a smaller , cheaper property as i can not afford to pay bills such as council tax on the proposed new salary .
kathleen toms , i have been employed by staffordshire county council at the moorlands vi form centre as the receptionist for the past eight years .
i have been an extremely hard working , loyal member of staff who has always done my best for the centre .
the moorlands is quite unique as the vi form for cheadle high school , painsley catholic college and moorside high school , so we have a number of bosses and are very often pulled in all directions trying to please .
i am the second longest serving member of staff at the vi form and one of the lowest paid .
for at least the last six years i have been on the same salary , the top of scale 2 with nowhere to progress to career wise or salary wise .
when i asked about a pay rise about three years ago i was told that due to job evaluation being implemented i had to wait for the results of that , so i have waited and waited and waited only to be told that i am not even worth the money i am receiving and i am probably going to have a pay cut ! !
i am going from the top of scale 2 to the top of grade 3 , this puts me in exactly the same position i was in but for less pay ! !
how does this make sense ?
the information received by many was distressing and totally demoralising .
staff who have served the county for many years went home on black friday feeling undervalued and insulted by the proposals .
mrs jane spooner , cheadle , staffordshire how can the job evaluation board who set my salary 18 months ago now cut my salary by £ 3700 , did they get it wrong then ?
of the 45 % who are getting rises how many are part time cleaners , dinner ladies , i do not mention these to berate these important positions but to make the point that the rises are pennies for staff who work part time , the cuts however are huge on full time staff who certainly in my own case have a massive amount of responsibilty , to the 1400 pupils in our high school .
our own head who fully supports us , has done his sums , and after giving out the rises ancuts now has £ 22,000 left .
ian mirams , uk both of us work for staffordshire county council and both our salaries have been cut .
we are very angry about this , i bet jim savage has not taken a cut in his salary .
also for all the people who think we are overpaid , should try working for the council !
i think they would feel different .
lynn and trev phillips , england i am a staffordshire county council worker .
i undertake legal child protection work on behalf of social services .
i have been informed of a proposed pay cut of £ 5000 .
this is an insult to my professionalism and sustained commitment shown on behalf of theis authority over fifteen years .
je is a back door route to cutting salary costs .
the communication of the proposals , has a stroke devastated the morale of staff who feel a sense of betrayal. anthony gannon , uk i am appalled by the proposed salary cuts .
we do n't want an apology from jim savege .
we want an acknowledgement from nigel pursey that staffs cc has got it wrong !
it seems that schools have been the hardest hit in salary cuts .
are staffs cc are saying that the heads and governors have got it wrong with the salaries they give to support staff ?
how do you expect to recruit and retain quality support staff in schools under these proposed pay cuts ?
we provide a valuable support service within our school .
we are totally demoralised and devalued .
this is felt throughout our school and affects teaching staff , students , teaching & learning and ultimately results .
sara massey -lrb- learning centre manager , de ferrers specialist technology college , burton -rrb- why do we continueto put council run activities into private management to save money as council run facilities seem to be run for the employees and not the public !
bernard broadhurst , staffordshire i work at staffordshire county council as a personal assistant and after fifteen years service my salary has been cut by £ 4,500k a year .
to watch such a smug interview by mr jim savage has simply added fuel to the fire of the anger i feel for him and for staffordshire county council as a whole .
they are treating their staff with utter contempt and i feel the interview only proved to show the ¿ holier than thou ¿ attitude which is currently being shown to loyal employees .
there is no way the man will apologise to his staff ¿ let ¿ s face it he is in a job that is paying thousands of pounds more than any of us ¿ has his job been evaluated ?
somehow i think not .
daphne sharp , the cc fails to advise you that the 45 % of employees it keeps saying are getting a pay rise are in fact 45 % of contracts , not people .
this is because a lot of these people are so poorly paid they have to have 2 or 3 jobs to make ends meet .
this cc is morally corrupt and should not be allowed to get away with destroying people 's lives in this way.also this labour government will be very badly hit as many traditional labour voters will not vote for them at the naxt election .
gordon brown needs to do something about this very quickly before it is too late.please do not mention my name in respect of this issue as i do fear recriminations anon , uk , staffordshire re-evaluation of council job descriptions .
the question of salary / wage equalisation will obviously pose many problems , particularly for those taking cuts in the proportions publicised .
however , there is one important question to be answered as a forerunner to the debate : " how will those involved in planning and implementing the proposals be affected " particularly senior executives and top administration ?
they should precede any comments , interviews or discussions with this information .
let them demonstrate how they will be part of the suffering .
les cooper , pensioners ' campaigner uk i am pa to a senior manager at staffordshire county council .
i have been down graded and stand to lose £ 2,000 per annum .
i recently attended a long service award ceremony with a colleague who has worked as a pa for 25 years , a week later she was downgraded and her salary would be reduced by £ 4,000 per annum .
a fitting reward for loyal service !
jim savege said that some people are doing the same jobs for different pay - this may be , but some people have more experience and i for one would expect a long serving member of staff to earn more money .
we have not been able to find many colleagues who will benefit , those whose salaries will increase will also be subject to no progression in the years to come and will therefore ultimately lose out .
when i signed my contract of employment i was happy to work for the salary offered i did not expect the contract to be broken .
we have all been demoralised by the whole process and feel that our hard work and loyalty are of no value .
freda green freda green , england many people have not even had a copy of their job over view , how is this consultation ? john , uk on the issue of single status in staffordshire , as it concerns equal pay , why does it not affect all levels of staff ie the senior management such as assistant directors and above ?
this is obviously only equal pay targeting the actual workers and is not aimed at the decision makers enforcing the policy !
local authority employee , england one point that the show did not cover was the real effects of the pay cuts , quoted as a percentage of real-salaries , afterall , a £ 10,000 pay cut will seam trivial to the rate payers if they also assume a salary of £ 100,0000 .
the view might change if the show had quoted a 40 % pay cut instead , for a job role which is already under paid when compared to the salary of the teachers who did the role , prior to the govermeents ' teacher work force remodelling ' programme .
it was also interesting that mr. savege was using percentages to justify the pay rises , but was not countered in a percentage manner by the interviewer .
leigh , uk i do n't know of any one who has their wages put up .
however all of my collegues in it have been cut up to £ 10,000 .
di brown , england i work for dudley council and we are at present going through the initial stages of this single status but we will have to wait until next year for the decisions .
i will be very interested to see what happens in staffordshire and all the other local councils .
we work very hard and deserve a decent days pay .
barry knowles , dudley perhaps you might like to ask mr savege this question : the explanatory booklet distributed to staff , with the accompanying job evaluation letter , states that : " through the introduction of an element of ' contribution - related pay ' , we can ensure that pay and grading review arrangements support and encourage all employees to achieve their full potential " .
their current proposal will put me back to a salary level that i had previously strived hard to reach some 5 years ago .
how does this help me continue to try and achieve my full potential ?
jeff stevens do n't be fooled by jim savege 's clever words and percentages .
even the 40 % of people who he claims will stay the same under the proposals are in fact losing money .
staffordshire county council is using the equality issue to save costs not to equalise pay ! !
loser2 , uk re the council cuts .
i work for the council and face a cut of £ 4,000 .
what i would like the council to clarify is the actual scale of the increases - jim quoted one person going up by £ 12k - i am not aware of any rises other than people possibly going up by a few hundred pounds per year- not balanced out by the thousands i and many many others stand to lose .
also - would like to point out the potential impact on local businesses - if my pay is cut for example i in turn will spend less in local shops and businesses .
joanne sherratt , england re - single status in midlands local authority it is unacceptable & immoral to cut the pay of professional white collar staff , using a crude & flawed job evaluation pay model , in order to fund pay rises for manual groups of workers .
staffordshire council will lose staff & staff good will through this bungled exercise andrew frank , england the percentage of staff who have had an increase in pay are in general part time workers and the increase is a couple of pounds a week .
in the trading standards department the lower grade of staff have seen a cut in pay while the highest grade have seen an increase .
all have seen a cap put on acreer progression .
how can this be equality of pay mark jurkiewicz , stafford uk wondered if your guest from hr on the council this morning is also taking a pay cut joe , uk my girlfriend works for the council and is to lose £ 4,500 from her salary .
what jim savege failed to mention is that all the top bosses have vetoed their salaries so they are not affected by the single salary status .
jobs for the boys or what ?
jes smart , stafford england council workers are already overpaid in my view and i would hate to pay more council tax to fund more money in their pay packet .
mark dean , midlands , uk interesting that again the message that 45 % of people are going up .
unfortunatly it would appear that these statistics are based on contracts not individuals .
a lot of staff have more than one contract , and as such some people are gaining as little as 30 pounds on one contract but losing thousands on the other .
if the council accepts that they have been under paying some staff then they should n't steal the money back from " their most valuable asset " as they put it .
the statistics are not worth the paper they are printed on untill all the base information / data is made available .
mark , england poor public sector workers .
welcome to the real world !
this kind of thing happens in the private sector all the time and we do n't have secure pensions to look forward to ! !
if you do n't like it , get another job .
richard , uk my husband also works for a local authority which is undergoing the same process , we would like to know is there any legal limit on the amount of reduction made to someones salary ?
it surely can not be legal to make a significant reduction when this will have a knock on effect to both their pension and every day life ?
thank you mrs taylor , uk i break even under the current proposals but am incensed by the appalling way staffordshire is treating its staff .
the statistics put out are very misleading and are skewed by , amongst other things , the inclusion of small gains for many part-time staff the figures for who should be converted to full time equivalents to show a more accurate reflection of the position .
a lot of damage has already been done and i find it difficult to envisage goodwill getting back to previous levels at least not for the foreseeable future .
terry edwards , uk as a scc employee , my main concern is that the headline figures given by the county council have been manipulated and are misleading spin .
the percentages of 45 % up , 30 % unchanged and 25 % down refer to ' contracts ' and include part time staff such as dinner ladies and school crossing patroles , many of whom are in the ' up ' group .
so a professional standing to loose up to £ 12,000 is counted against many part time workers who may all be give an extra few pounds in there pay packets .
additionally , my letter indicated that my salery would remain unchanged but that is based on my current pay and by the time the proposals would come into effect next year , i would take a cut so should n't i be one of the ' down ' section ?
this again would not make the story as good as the job evaluation team and their management would like .
however , getting any additional information , other than the official stroy has proved very difficult and i myself have not recieved satisfactory responces to request made under the freedom of information act 2000 .
chris mitchell , uk i consider myself extemely fortunate as my salary under job evaluation will remain unchanged , however i am totally in support of my colleagues who are taking massive pay cuts .
it is not just the people who will be losing who disagree with the present outcome of job evaluation .
the effect on morale is devastating and the county council must understand that service delivery will inevertably be seriously affected .
alan wrench , england my partner and i both work for staffordshire county council .
our combined loss is £ 6000 .
we are expecting our first child in march 2006 and are extremely concerned at how we will cope with mortgage payments and the cost of bringing up a young child .
apart from our own issues i have noticed morale in the office is at an all time low .
the standard of the service that we provide has also suffered .
no one is prepared to go the extra inch to ensure customers are happy anymore .
i hope councillors realise the impact this will have on their constituents .
richard harris , uk in the department where i work , -lrb- development services -rrb- , which deals with highways and planning , 67 % of staff will receive a reduction in their pay - that 's not job evaluation , its an out and out pay cut and its scandalous .
richard , england my current salary is £ 30843 going down to £ 23952 .
i am very disappointed in the way staffordshire county council have dealt with the job evaluation process .
i have only worked for the council for less than 3 years in this current position and i am struggling to see why the remuneration for this job has changed so dramatically the main question for me is how can the council really expect employees to take such a huge pay cut .
this proposal is not only morally incorrect -lrb- i expect more from a local government employer -rrb- but actually is unsustainable by the council .
helen bradley , my salary will fall by £ 5200 .
not only do they propose cutting pay but grades have altered - employees can longer work towards a higher grade .
many who have had a pay rise will not in fact have a job in a year or so !
people working in residential homes -lrb- they are closing -rrb- home carers -lrb- numbers being reduced by at least 50 % -rrb- management do not tell this to the media .
the way that the mr pursey and mr savege are treating their employees is disgraceful - i no longer trust anything they say .
they have destroyed our goodwill in one fell swoop .
they have not arrived at this with the unions and this needs to be exposed .
sue mountford , england after 20 years as a surveyor at british coal i went to leicestershire county council after 10 years as head of planning enforcement we underwent job evaluation in 2002 .
i took a small cut in salary and along with many colleagues including all of the planning enforcement officers i voted with my resignation and relocated to staffordshire county council as team leader responsible for the planning regulation team .
only to be presented 4 years later with a proposal to cut the team salaries by £ 6000 and because of the removal of career grades for established officers and increments for new starters this could be as much as £ 11000 for the team .
how can resolving the injustice of unequal pay be solved by creating even more injustice , at this time of year the people of staffordshire , for whom we all work will see a reduction in service from disillusioned staff and will ultimately express their views at the ballot box .
doug walker , england i work for staffordshire county council and feel the whole process has been dealt with very badly .
if these proposals are implemented the county will be a lot poorer for the people who live here who deserve a good standard of service , i am afraid these will suffer as experienced and devoted staff will leave. nick boot , england at the time of the 1997 single status agreement , the signatory unions and employers had not secured the necessary funding from central government -lrb- unlike the nhs agenda for change -rrb- .
union branches are now left to try and clear up this nationally negotiated idealogical mess at local level and their members -lrb- many of who are female -rrb- are paying the price with significant salary cuts .
anon from birmingham , england these percentage figures -lrb- 45 % up , 25 % down -rrb- are based on contracts , not head-count .
many casuals , p art-timers have multiple contracts .
everyone who sees these figures assume they relate to head-count .
this fact alone warps their meaning .
most of the losers are full-timers losing obscene amounts , as stated .
based on fte -lrb- full-time equivalents -rrb- the losers will outweigh the winners significantly in both head-count and monetary losses .
employees are demanding these figures , but the employer persists in withholding the data and spinning the statistics .
anonymous , england i am one of the very concerned 28.000 employees working for staffordshire county council .
i took part in yesterday 's demonstration which again received a lot of media coverage .
i am still in a state of shock as far as the new pay proposals are concerned and can not believe that as local authority workers the government are prepared to subject us to this .
but what bothers me most at the moment is how this whole job evaluation is coming across in the media .
it is not just the alleged 25 % of workers who stand to loose that are distressed by this proposal it is the entirety of the workforce .
everyone looses there are no clear winners .
all of the grades have been reduced from the top right through to the bottom .
county councillors are not fully aware of what is going on around them for the most part they live in their own little social bubble .
the job evaluation process is far from fair it is discriminatory .
it has thrown up so many inconsistencies and anomalies be beggars belief .
and lastly and probably most importantly is the array of services we provide , most of staffordshire county council employees do more than what is included in our job descriptions , we work long hours and do n't get overtime , we do n't use our flexi time , some of use do n't even claim expenses .
a huge chunck of our work revolves around good will and a can do approach .
good will that is directed at providing the best possible service we can to the public despite staff shortages and financial restraints .
sarah fraser , staffordshire . , england your phone calls ...
i work at staffordshire county council and i am in charge of 25 people .
as of yet i do n't know what my salary will be but i know that the staff that work for me are very upset and de-motivated about their situation .
this is making for the very difficult working day .
anonymous , west midlands as a council tax payer these cuts by staffordshire council for their workers must prove the incompetence of the council .
if they were paying people £ 12 000 over what they say they require now , then why they were paying it for so long time ?
this is just another example of how council tax payers ' money is being wasted .
george , newcastle-under-lyme my daughter is one of those who will have a pay cut .
she is highly qualified and does a great deal of overtime unpaid .
i think that these people are being treated absolutely disgracefully .
this is a policy of the old victorian mine owners where they think they can just come along and cut people 's pay by thousands of pounds .
but nobody thinks what these people will do , where they will find the money for mortgages , clothing , etc .
these people may lose their homes .
they are sitting and crying about it but the authorities do not care .
mrs e. biddle , stafford i 've worked for the staffordshire county council since 1978 and i 'm retiring this christmas .
my wages when i started was £ 4.10 and i am now on £ 5.80 .
where is inflation in 28 years ?
margaret , stafford as far as i 'm concerned council employees are overpaid .
if they think that they can go to the private sector and can earn as much money with gold plated pension at the age of 60 , then let them do so .
if they ca n't then they should accept the proposal put forward .
aaron , walsall i work in the education department of staffordshire county council .
my colleagues and i are all being paid a different amount .
there is no recognition of experience or qualifications .
people who have been working for 12 years are getting pay cut below people who only just started .
we are all disgusted with how we have been treated .
we are being informed about £ 15.000 pay cut by a letter !
anonymous , staffordshire i am a pa to deputy corporate director .
my wage will be dropped by £ 2250 and my line manager 's by £ 7500 .
i do n't understand where my career structure has gone after 19 years of service .
it does n't seem fair at all !
tracey , stafford looking at the road alterations around our area i think that all the planers involved must be overpaid judging by the standard of the work they do .
if £ 10.000 can be a reduction in salary then what the original salaries are like ?
william , gloucester i work for the staffordshire county council and my salary will be cut .
i am disgusted that no apology has been given to us from your guest .
steve , staffordshire i work for the staffordshire county council and under the job evaluation scheme i 've been classified as one of the winners .
however , for the next 3 years i will not receive any pay increase , no career progression .
as a qualified solicitor it was my choice to work for local government but i do have doubts now .
anonymous , staffordshire i 've worked for the council for 20 years and i 'm disgusted with the way i 've been treated .
julie , stoke-on-trent i think that the wage structures that the council implemented over the years , they are responsible for the problems that have been created .
mr davis , walsall i am an employee of staffordshire county council .
my job is a unique , technical post .
i was employed in march this year and nobody mentioned any job evaluation scheme back then .
i think the county council will loose lots of qualified and devoted staff ..
mark , stoke-on-trent this situation is an absolute disgrace .
if there are two people on the same job , the lower one should be brought up to the higher one .
i would definitely support the strike .

when raf stafford was due to close the county council produced statistics to show the detrimental economic effect this would have to stafford borough .
with a sizeable proportion of the 7,000 people affected living and working in the area the impact to both the economy of the borough and to house prices could be severe .
has anyone called for an economic assessment ?
ed hooper , staffordshire when job evaluation is used in the private sector , which is n't that common , it is n't usually undertaken with the aim of imposing widespread and swingeing pay cuts ; job evaluation is n't scientific or infallible .
the margin of error means that many jobs are inappropriately downgraded ; council workers ' pay has dropped 20 % relative to pay in the wider economy since parity was last established by comparability in 1979 .
many essential workers already earn less than their private sector equivalents and plan to leave local government when the pay cuts are imposed ; the average council worker 's pension is £ 6,000 when the average pension in the wider economy is £ 11,000 ; j e isacon , england my salary will be going down 35 % to £ 16137 .
i am married with two children and a mortgage .
how will we survive this ?
i 'm appalled by the arrogant attitude of mr savege .
does he realise that if he gets his way there will be huge council tax rises as it will cost the county council a lot more to contract work out when we have all left the county council !
steve , england mr. savege stated that this process was to enable people -lrb- male / female -rrb- to be paid the same for doing the same job - if this is the case why then have people , who are doing identical jobs , been graded differently .
could it be because the county council do n't realise that the schemes they are using are seriously flawed .
as for the so called apology it is too late the damage has been done .
wendy , england i have worked for nearly 25 years for staffordshire county council in libraries and with experience and competitive interview gained small promotions which have now been devalued and degraded to be rendered meaningless .
i am now set to receive just £ 15,000 ... a drop of £ 3000 .
it seems the pay of the low paid is just being redistributed to other low paid workers and the reality is that a huge chasm is opening up between us and those like mr savege at the top of the tree who give themselves hefty payrises .
we have all been given a huge slap in the face .
cecile harrison , england job evaluation in staffordshire will equate to job migration .
employees are very upset and distressed with the way that this has been handled by the hr department , even those who have allegedly had a pay rise are supporting those against job evaluation .
as for equal pay for equal jobs , this is a nonsense .
my pay will stay the same as will another collegues who does the same job as myself .
this job evaluation is a cost cutting exercise which is being pushed through with the restructure to hide job losses and reduce the need for redundency pay , as many will seek to leave the department .
mandy harrison , england whilst a degree of sympathy has to go out to those that will lose out should the proposed pay structure be implemented following the je process , it is a certainty that zero regard will have been given by such individuals for those that have been paid disproportionately for doing a job requiring the same or comparable skills -in many cases for years .
it would be foolish and ignorant to assume the fact not a single comment on this web site supporting the process can be seen , is down to a purely negative reaction across the board .
there is certainly an element of people that have been underpaid for years , that having now had this recognised , feel embarrassed to claim what is rightfully theirs for fear of reprisals and that is wrong .
anon , england the impression i get is that the council are using the excuse of job evaluation to " fix " something that " ai n't broke " .
the amount paid by the council to an employee will always be determined largely by market forces , and no amount of " fixing " by the powers that be , will ever change this .
as margaret thatcher once said " you ca n't buck the market " .
job evaluation has suggested that almost 20,000 employees ' salaries are in error .
well , given a choice between ' the market ' and job evaluation , i would choose ' the market ' every time as the more accurate and fairer setter of employees salaries .
-lrb- btw , my salary 's down by £ 5k or 15 % . -rrb-
mike hinton , uk i am writing to express my disgust at the whole job evaluation scheme with is affecting me and thousands of my hard working colleagues .
i do not know how the county council expects the departments to work effectively when they know they can not pay their mortgage or feed their children .
it is a terrifying prospect .
although i did not see your programme , i thank you for bringing it to the attention of the wider public. paul rochfort , england in response to aaron and mark dean - it has been clearly proven that council staff across the country are paid no where near market levels for the jobs they do .
council staff work long hours to provide you the tax payer with the services you take for granted .
how would you like to receive a faceless side of a4 with minimal information on , telling you that " oops , sorry , you 'll have to take a £ 10,000 pay cut " ?
the county has continually hidden the truth about this proposal behind spin and more rhetoric - even to go on record as saying " our staff are our greatest asset " in response to the march last thursday ! !
savage has now gone on national tv to say " 45 % of staff go up " .
wrong ! ! ! 45 % of contracts go up , with alot of people in the posts being increased having more than 1 contract .
it is pure spin and half truthes to win over the media and the public .
45 % up by £ 500 does not equal 25 % down on average by £ 4000 .
you do the maths and tell me how this is not a cost cutting ! exercise .
richard pearce , jim savege had the chance live on television to apologise to the thousands upon thousands of council workers for who this job evaluation has caused demoralisation and distress .
but he chose not to .
council workers are the back bone to many front line services , most of those hardest hit are school support staff , including those who have worked hours upon hours of unpiad overtime as a good will gesture , including those who have worked tirelessly giving years and years continual service to the county .
so the council ca n't even give the smallest gesture of an apology , no wonder there is talk of a strike ! ! ! !
rob , england the day after all the support staff received this bombshell letter on 10 november , the teachers all received a mailout from the nut urging them to take action re ' reducing teachers workload ' - i 'm sure the teachers would n't take a 11-16 % pay cut , they would walk out , so why do staffordshire county council think they can do this to support staff ?
incredible !
so much for building a career to have the last three years performance progression wiped out in one move .
how to demoralise a whole section of the workforce with one blow ! fed up secretary , uk the proposed pay cuts for staffordshire county council employees have caused distress and anguish to people across all departments .
i am astounded that an organisation that employs 28,000 people has not set up a counselling service or a debt helpline .
instead , the booklet that was distributed with the letters lists the numbers of the citizen 's advice bureau , a clear indication that the council were aware of the stress and anxiety the proposed pay model was likely to cause .
olwen johnson , stafford , uk i earn £ 14523 per year as a library assistant at your library i work long hours often early mornings one evening a week till seven and saturday .
i 'm set to lose £ 400 per year so maybe i 'm one the lucky ones but what hurts the most is that your library staff score the the lowest on the je evaulation forms even the cleaners have more knowledge than your library staff who often spend time teaching people how to use computers and dealing bus and train timetable enquires .
all we want is a fair days money for a fair days work and to be shown a little repsect from ssc .
anon uk after 22 years service my salary will fall from £ 18,000 to £ 14,000 taking me back to where i was in 1997 .
i 'm single and disabled and would have to sell my home .
perhaps i should just live on the state ?
ed hooper , uk i would like to reply to those who think that county council workers are overpaid by giving a few examples of the proposed cuts .
i can understand that a £ 10,000 pay cut implies that the original salary is generous , but in fact this is a huge proportion of the individuals ' salaries , which is why this is so painful .
for example one of my colleagues would drop from £ 25,000 to £ 14,000 .
another would drop from £ 14,500 to £ 12,700 .
a couple of my colleagues would drop from £ 17,900 to £ 14,100 .
w. timothy , uk having analysed the spreadsheets supplied by the council , it does indeed seem that the " rises amount to no more than a few pounds in many cases , while the cuts are huge . "
sonia deol used those words to jim savege on tv , he effectively ignored the question , presumably because he had no answer and it gives the cost-cutting game away .
geoff , uk any staff who 's pay remains unchanged under the job evaluation and single status proposals , face the prospect of having no opportunity to get a pay rise in future because the top of the pay scale has been adjusted downwards .
this will have a similar impact on affected staff to the proposed pay cuts .
the effect of this -lrb- if implemented -rrb- will be to further negatively impact recruitment and retention which will already have been made virtually impossible for key staff particularly ict staff by the reduction in salaries !
yours , chris snow rugeley , staffs .
chris snow , uk mr savege ¿ s point that many people doing the same jobs are on different salaries , in response : 1 .
the law lords have ruled that different levels of pay are quite acceptable provided the reason for that difference is not sexual discrimination .
2 .
the employer has set these contracts up many in the last 10 years without properly evaluating them at the beginning , why should the employee pay for the employers mistakes ? 3 .
where was this sense of duty , when it came to employing people in the last 10 years and where is it now ?
this is a cynical ploy , to reduce staff numbers by getting them to leave so that the authority wo n't have to pay redundancies , which are already established as part of an ongoing review .
it might be worth asking him if he and the rest of the senior management team still think they have the confidence of the workforce ?
finally , if as stated this is a starting point for negotiation , why are cabinet being asked to make a decision on this in january , that is not consultation , but dictatorship , they could have consulted without setting up cabinet to decide on this ¿ .
p butler , uk i 'm a council worker and am set to lose over £ 4,000 .
having just watched your programme , i was astounded to hear jim savege 's comments .
i liked the way he avoided having to apologise for the upset and worry this process is causing .
you should have asked him about the £ 20,000 pay rise himself and the other directors have awarded themselves .
i 'm even more worried now as i received a letter on saturday from my mortgage lender saying from 1 january my mortgage will increase .
can things get any worse ?
this is making me ill .
mrs j , staffordshire i am writing with regard to the implementation of job evaluation at staffordshire county council , as an employee of some 25 years .
when the scheme was first introduced some 4 years ago , the principles and procedures were accepted by staff as a fair means to achieve parity of salaries across local authorities .
in retrospect , this now seems unquestioningly naive .
we have been subjected to a kafka-esque situation in which we were required to sign off the assessment of our jobs without knowledge of the scoring procedure , and before the pay model was determined .
sheila penfold , england i am senior science technician in a large secondary school .
i have worked in quality control laboratories in industry , have a degree in biology and environmental studies and have spent the last nine years working as a technician in schools , the last four years as senior technician .
my letter regarding the outcome of job evaluation put me on the same grade and salary as the other technicians , a drop of £ 1000 , admittedly not a huge reduction compared to many other workers in staffordshire , but this will mean i will have to sell my house and move to a smaller , cheaper property as i can not afford to pay bills such as council tax on the proposed new salary .
kathleen toms , i have been employed by staffordshire county council at the moorlands vi form centre as the receptionist for the past eight years .
i have been an extremely hard working , loyal member of staff who has always done my best for the centre .
the moorlands is quite unique as the vi form for cheadle high school , painsley catholic college and moorside high school , so we have a number of bosses and are very often pulled in all directions trying to please .
i am the second longest serving member of staff at the vi form and one of the lowest paid .
for at least the last six years i have been on the same salary , the top of scale 2 with nowhere to progress to career wise or salary wise .
when i asked about a pay rise about three years ago i was told that due to job evaluation being implemented i had to wait for the results of that , so i have waited and waited and waited only to be told that i am not even worth the money i am receiving and i am probably going to have a pay cut ! !
i am going from the top of scale 2 to the top of grade 3 , this puts me in exactly the same position i was in but for less pay ! !
how does this make sense ?
the information received by many was distressing and totally demoralising .
staff who have served the county for many years went home on black friday feeling undervalued and insulted by the proposals .
mrs jane spooner , cheadle , staffordshire how can the job evaluation board who set my salary 18 months ago now cut my salary by £ 3700 , did they get it wrong then ?
of the 45 % who are getting rises how many are part time cleaners , dinner ladies , i do not mention these to berate these important positions but to make the point that the rises are pennies for staff who work part time , the cuts however are huge on full time staff who certainly in my own case have a massive amount of responsibilty , to the 1400 pupils in our high school .
our own head who fully supports us , has done his sums , and after giving out the rises ancuts now has £ 22,000 left .
ian mirams , uk both of us work for staffordshire county council and both our salaries have been cut .
we are very angry about this , i bet jim savage has not taken a cut in his salary .
also for all the people who think we are overpaid , should try working for the council !
i think they would feel different .
lynn and trev phillips , england i am a staffordshire county council worker .
i undertake legal child protection work on behalf of social services .
i have been informed of a proposed pay cut of £ 5000 .
this is an insult to my professionalism and sustained commitment shown on behalf of theis authority over fifteen years .
je is a back door route to cutting salary costs .
the communication of the proposals , has a stroke devastated the morale of staff who feel a sense of betrayal. anthony gannon , uk i am appalled by the proposed salary cuts .
we do n't want an apology from jim savege .
we want an acknowledgement from nigel pursey that staffs cc has got it wrong !
it seems that schools have been the hardest hit in salary cuts .
are staffs cc are saying that the heads and governors have got it wrong with the salaries they give to support staff ?
how do you expect to recruit and retain quality support staff in schools under these proposed pay cuts ?
we provide a valuable support service within our school .
we are totally demoralised and devalued .
this is felt throughout our school and affects teaching staff , students , teaching & learning and ultimately results .
sara massey -lrb- learning centre manager , de ferrers specialist technology college , burton -rrb- why do we continueto put council run activities into private management to save money as council run facilities seem to be run for the employees and not the public !
bernard broadhurst , staffordshire i work at staffordshire county council as a personal assistant and after fifteen years service my salary has been cut by £ 4,500k a year .
to watch such a smug interview by mr jim savage has simply added fuel to the fire of the anger i feel for him and for staffordshire county council as a whole .
they are treating their staff with utter contempt and i feel the interview only proved to show the ¿ holier than thou ¿ attitude which is currently being shown to loyal employees .
there is no way the man will apologise to his staff ¿ let ¿ s face it he is in a job that is paying thousands of pounds more than any of us ¿ has his job been evaluated ?
somehow i think not .
daphne sharp , the cc fails to advise you that the 45 % of employees it keeps saying are getting a pay rise are in fact 45 % of contracts , not people .
this is because a lot of these people are so poorly paid they have to have 2 or 3 jobs to make ends meet .
this cc is morally corrupt and should not be allowed to get away with destroying people 's lives in this way.also this labour government will be very badly hit as many traditional labour voters will not vote for them at the naxt election .
gordon brown needs to do something about this very quickly before it is too late.please do not mention my name in respect of this issue as i do fear recriminations anon , uk , staffordshire re-evaluation of council job descriptions .
the question of salary / wage equalisation will obviously pose many problems , particularly for those taking cuts in the proportions publicised .
however , there is one important question to be answered as a forerunner to the debate : " how will those involved in planning and implementing the proposals be affected " particularly senior executives and top administration ?
they should precede any comments , interviews or discussions with this information .
let them demonstrate how they will be part of the suffering .
les cooper , pensioners ' campaigner uk i am pa to a senior manager at staffordshire county council .
i have been down graded and stand to lose £ 2,000 per annum .
i recently attended a long service award ceremony with a colleague who has worked as a pa for 25 years , a week later she was downgraded and her salary would be reduced by £ 4,000 per annum .
a fitting reward for loyal service !
jim savege said that some people are doing the same jobs for different pay - this may be , but some people have more experience and i for one would expect a long serving member of staff to earn more money .
we have not been able to find many colleagues who will benefit , those whose salaries will increase will also be subject to no progression in the years to come and will therefore ultimately lose out .
when i signed my contract of employment i was happy to work for the salary offered i did not expect the contract to be broken .
we have all been demoralised by the whole process and feel that our hard work and loyalty are of no value .
freda green freda green , england many people have not even had a copy of their job over view , how is this consultation ? john , uk on the issue of single status in staffordshire , as it concerns equal pay , why does it not affect all levels of staff ie the senior management such as assistant directors and above ?
this is obviously only equal pay targeting the actual workers and is not aimed at the decision makers enforcing the policy !
local authority employee , england one point that the show did not cover was the real effects of the pay cuts , quoted as a percentage of real-salaries , afterall , a £ 10,000 pay cut will seam trivial to the rate payers if they also assume a salary of £ 100,0000 .
the view might change if the show had quoted a 40 % pay cut instead , for a job role which is already under paid when compared to the salary of the teachers who did the role , prior to the govermeents ' teacher work force remodelling ' programme .
it was also interesting that mr. savege was using percentages to justify the pay rises , but was not countered in a percentage manner by the interviewer .
leigh , uk i do n't know of any one who has their wages put up .
however all of my collegues in it have been cut up to £ 10,000 .
di brown , england i work for dudley council and we are at present going through the initial stages of this single status but we will have to wait until next year for the decisions .
i will be very interested to see what happens in staffordshire and all the other local councils .
we work very hard and deserve a decent days pay .
barry knowles , dudley perhaps you might like to ask mr savege this question : the explanatory booklet distributed to staff , with the accompanying job evaluation letter , states that : " through the introduction of an element of ' contribution - related pay ' , we can ensure that pay and grading review arrangements support and encourage all employees to achieve their full potential " .
their current proposal will put me back to a salary level that i had previously strived hard to reach some 5 years ago .
how does this help me continue to try and achieve my full potential ?
jeff stevens do n't be fooled by jim savege 's clever words and percentages .
even the 40 % of people who he claims will stay the same under the proposals are in fact losing money .
staffordshire county council is using the equality issue to save costs not to equalise pay ! !
loser2 , uk re the council cuts .
i work for the council and face a cut of £ 4,000 .
what i would like the council to clarify is the actual scale of the increases - jim quoted one person going up by £ 12k - i am not aware of any rises other than people possibly going up by a few hundred pounds per year- not balanced out by the thousands i and many many others stand to lose .
also - would like to point out the potential impact on local businesses - if my pay is cut for example i in turn will spend less in local shops and businesses .
joanne sherratt , england re - single status in midlands local authority it is unacceptable & immoral to cut the pay of professional white collar staff , using a crude & flawed job evaluation pay model , in order to fund pay rises for manual groups of workers .
staffordshire council will lose staff & staff good will through this bungled exercise andrew frank , england the percentage of staff who have had an increase in pay are in general part time workers and the increase is a couple of pounds a week .
in the trading standards department the lower grade of staff have seen a cut in pay while the highest grade have seen an increase .
all have seen a cap put on acreer progression .
how can this be equality of pay mark jurkiewicz , stafford uk wondered if your guest from hr on the council this morning is also taking a pay cut joe , uk my girlfriend works for the council and is to lose £ 4,500 from her salary .
what jim savege failed to mention is that all the top bosses have vetoed their salaries so they are not affected by the single salary status .
jobs for the boys or what ?
jes smart , stafford england council workers are already overpaid in my view and i would hate to pay more council tax to fund more money in their pay packet .
mark dean , midlands , uk interesting that again the message that 45 % of people are going up .
unfortunatly it would appear that these statistics are based on contracts not individuals .
a lot of staff have more than one contract , and as such some people are gaining as little as 30 pounds on one contract but losing thousands on the other .
if the council accepts that they have been under paying some staff then they should n't steal the money back from " their most valuable asset " as they put it .
the statistics are not worth the paper they are printed on untill all the base information / data is made available .
mark , england poor public sector workers .
welcome to the real world !
this kind of thing happens in the private sector all the time and we do n't have secure pensions to look forward to ! !
if you do n't like it , get another job .
richard , uk my husband also works for a local authority which is undergoing the same process , we would like to know is there any legal limit on the amount of reduction made to someones salary ?
it surely can not be legal to make a significant reduction when this will have a knock on effect to both their pension and every day life ?
thank you mrs taylor , uk i break even under the current proposals but am incensed by the appalling way staffordshire is treating its staff .
the statistics put out are very misleading and are skewed by , amongst other things , the inclusion of small gains for many part-time staff the figures for who should be converted to full time equivalents to show a more accurate reflection of the position .
a lot of damage has already been done and i find it difficult to envisage goodwill getting back to previous levels at least not for the foreseeable future .
terry edwards , uk as a scc employee , my main concern is that the headline figures given by the county council have been manipulated and are misleading spin .
the percentages of 45 % up , 30 % unchanged and 25 % down refer to ' contracts ' and include part time staff such as dinner ladies and school crossing patroles , many of whom are in the ' up ' group .
so a professional standing to loose up to £ 12,000 is counted against many part time workers who may all be give an extra few pounds in there pay packets .
additionally , my letter indicated that my salery would remain unchanged but that is based on my current pay and by the time the proposals would come into effect next year , i would take a cut so should n't i be one of the ' down ' section ?
this again would not make the story as good as the job evaluation team and their management would like .
however , getting any additional information , other than the official stroy has proved very difficult and i myself have not recieved satisfactory responces to request made under the freedom of information act 2000 .
chris mitchell , uk i consider myself extemely fortunate as my salary under job evaluation will remain unchanged , however i am totally in support of my colleagues who are taking massive pay cuts .
it is not just the people who will be losing who disagree with the present outcome of job evaluation .
the effect on morale is devastating and the county council must understand that service delivery will inevertably be seriously affected .
alan wrench , england my partner and i both work for staffordshire county council .
our combined loss is £ 6000 .
we are expecting our first child in march 2006 and are extremely concerned at how we will cope with mortgage payments and the cost of bringing up a young child .
apart from our own issues i have noticed morale in the office is at an all time low .
the standard of the service that we provide has also suffered .
no one is prepared to go the extra inch to ensure customers are happy anymore .
i hope councillors realise the impact this will have on their constituents .
richard harris , uk in the department where i work , -lrb- development services -rrb- , which deals with highways and planning , 67 % of staff will receive a reduction in their pay - that 's not job evaluation , its an out and out pay cut and its scandalous .
richard , england my current salary is £ 30843 going down to £ 23952 .
i am very disappointed in the way staffordshire county council have dealt with the job evaluation process .
i have only worked for the council for less than 3 years in this current position and i am struggling to see why the remuneration for this job has changed so dramatically the main question for me is how can the council really expect employees to take such a huge pay cut .
this proposal is not only morally incorrect -lrb- i expect more from a local government employer -rrb- but actually is unsustainable by the council .
helen bradley , my salary will fall by £ 5200 .
not only do they propose cutting pay but grades have altered - employees can longer work towards a higher grade .
many who have had a pay rise will not in fact have a job in a year or so !
people working in residential homes -lrb- they are closing -rrb- home carers -lrb- numbers being reduced by at least 50 % -rrb- management do not tell this to the media .
the way that the mr pursey and mr savege are treating their employees is disgraceful - i no longer trust anything they say .
they have destroyed our goodwill in one fell swoop .
they have not arrived at this with the unions and this needs to be exposed .
sue mountford , england after 20 years as a surveyor at british coal i went to leicestershire county council after 10 years as head of planning enforcement we underwent job evaluation in 2002 .
i took a small cut in salary and along with many colleagues including all of the planning enforcement officers i voted with my resignation and relocated to staffordshire county council as team leader responsible for the planning regulation team .
only to be presented 4 years later with a proposal to cut the team salaries by £ 6000 and because of the removal of career grades for established officers and increments for new starters this could be as much as £ 11000 for the team .
how can resolving the injustice of unequal pay be solved by creating even more injustice , at this time of year the people of staffordshire , for whom we all work will see a reduction in service from disillusioned staff and will ultimately express their views at the ballot box .
doug walker , england i work for staffordshire county council and feel the whole process has been dealt with very badly .
if these proposals are implemented the county will be a lot poorer for the people who live here who deserve a good standard of service , i am afraid these will suffer as experienced and devoted staff will leave. nick boot , england at the time of the 1997 single status agreement , the signatory unions and employers had not secured the necessary funding from central government -lrb- unlike the nhs agenda for change -rrb- .
union branches are now left to try and clear up this nationally negotiated idealogical mess at local level and their members -lrb- many of who are female -rrb- are paying the price with significant salary cuts .
anon from birmingham , england these percentage figures -lrb- 45 % up , 25 % down -rrb- are based on contracts , not head-count .
many casuals , p art-timers have multiple contracts .
everyone who sees these figures assume they relate to head-count .
this fact alone warps their meaning .
most of the losers are full-timers losing obscene amounts , as stated .
based on fte -lrb- full-time equivalents -rrb- the losers will outweigh the winners significantly in both head-count and monetary losses .
employees are demanding these figures , but the employer persists in withholding the data and spinning the statistics .
anonymous , england i am one of the very concerned 28.000 employees working for staffordshire county council .
i took part in yesterday 's demonstration which again received a lot of media coverage .
i am still in a state of shock as far as the new pay proposals are concerned and can not believe that as local authority workers the government are prepared to subject us to this .
but what bothers me most at the moment is how this whole job evaluation is coming across in the media .
it is not just the alleged 25 % of workers who stand to loose that are distressed by this proposal it is the entirety of the workforce .
everyone looses there are no clear winners .
all of the grades have been reduced from the top right through to the bottom .
county councillors are not fully aware of what is going on around them for the most part they live in their own little social bubble .
the job evaluation process is far from fair it is discriminatory .
it has thrown up so many inconsistencies and anomalies be beggars belief .
and lastly and probably most importantly is the array of services we provide , most of staffordshire county council employees do more than what is included in our job descriptions , we work long hours and do n't get overtime , we do n't use our flexi time , some of use do n't even claim expenses .
a huge chunck of our work revolves around good will and a can do approach .
good will that is directed at providing the best possible service we can to the public despite staff shortages and financial restraints .
sarah fraser , staffordshire . , england your phone calls ...
i work at staffordshire county council and i am in charge of 25 people .
as of yet i do n't know what my salary will be but i know that the staff that work for me are very upset and de-motivated about their situation .
this is making for the very difficult working day .
anonymous , west midlands as a council tax payer these cuts by staffordshire council for their workers must prove the incompetence of the council .
if they were paying people £ 12 000 over what they say they require now , then why they were paying it for so long time ?
this is just another example of how council tax payers ' money is being wasted .
george , newcastle-under-lyme my daughter is one of those who will have a pay cut .
she is highly qualified and does a great deal of overtime unpaid .
i think that these people are being treated absolutely disgracefully .
this is a policy of the old victorian mine owners where they think they can just come along and cut people 's pay by thousands of pounds .
but nobody thinks what these people will do , where they will find the money for mortgages , clothing , etc .
these people may lose their homes .
they are sitting and crying about it but the authorities do not care .
mrs e. biddle , stafford i 've worked for the staffordshire county council since 1978 and i 'm retiring this christmas .
my wages when i started was £ 4.10 and i am now on £ 5.80 .
where is inflation in 28 years ?
margaret , stafford as far as i 'm concerned council employees are overpaid .
if they think that they can go to the private sector and can earn as much money with gold plated pension at the age of 60 , then let them do so .
if they ca n't then they should accept the proposal put forward .
aaron , walsall i work in the education department of staffordshire county council .
my colleagues and i are all being paid a different amount .
there is no recognition of experience or qualifications .
people who have been working for 12 years are getting pay cut below people who only just started .
we are all disgusted with how we have been treated .
we are being informed about £ 15.000 pay cut by a letter !
anonymous , staffordshire i am a pa to deputy corporate director .
my wage will be dropped by £ 2250 and my line manager 's by £ 7500 .
i do n't understand where my career structure has gone after 19 years of service .
it does n't seem fair at all !
tracey , stafford looking at the road alterations around our area i think that all the planers involved must be overpaid judging by the standard of the work they do .
if £ 10.000 can be a reduction in salary then what the original salaries are like ?
william , gloucester i work for the staffordshire county council and my salary will be cut .
i am disgusted that no apology has been given to us from your guest .
steve , staffordshire i work for the staffordshire county council and under the job evaluation scheme i 've been classified as one of the winners .
however , for the next 3 years i will not receive any pay increase , no career progression .
as a qualified solicitor it was my choice to work for local government but i do have doubts now .
anonymous , staffordshire i 've worked for the council for 20 years and i 'm disgusted with the way i 've been treated .
julie , stoke-on-trent i think that the wage structures that the council implemented over the years , they are responsible for the problems that have been created .
mr davis , walsall i am an employee of staffordshire county council .
my job is a unique , technical post .
i was employed in march this year and nobody mentioned any job evaluation scheme back then .
i think the county council will loose lots of qualified and devoted staff ..
mark , stoke-on-trent this situation is an absolute disgrace .
if there are two people on the same job , the lower one should be brought up to the higher one .
i would definitely support the strike .

the report is expected to say the break-up of cohabiting couples leads to severe social problems and the social consequences - such as drug abuse and poverty - cost the uk £ 20bn a year .
mr duncan smith , who said the report does not set out policy plans at this stage , told the bbc 's politics show that marriage had been " undermined " by the tax and benefits system under the labour government .
