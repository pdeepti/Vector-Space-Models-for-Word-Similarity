more and more teens are revisiting a pastime more often associated with their grandparents ' generation : ballroom dancing . if youth has its finger on the pulse of popular culture , then germany 's heart is beating to the rhythms of the rumba , cha-cha , foxtrot and waltz . mia hinrichs is a 15-year-old high school student from cologne whose passions include playing soccer and watching the " the gilmore girls " on television .
last year , when a boy in her class asked her if she would be his partner in a ballroom dancing class , she had to think twice before she agreed . but that was three classes ago , and mia and her friends - their number has since increased - are still going strong .
" i 'll keep it up if my parents allow me to keep going , " hinrichs said .
" i 'd like to get my bronze and silver -lrb- proficiency-level certificates . -rrb- " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drama of ballroom dancing was shown in baz luhrmann 's film " strictly ballroom " a ballroom dancing class was once an unavoidable rite of passage for middle- and upper-class german teens ; a necessary tool for getting by at social events like formal work functions and weddings .
but those classes began to fall out of favor in the 1980s and 90s . hip trend recently , hamburg dance teacher jan giesel told stern magazine that the " low point was 1996 … that 's when nothing was less cool that couples ' dancing . "
many dance schools did n't survive those decades ; those that did banked on hip hop and aerobics classes . now , however , ballroom is back .
the association of german dance schools -lrb- adtv -rrb- reports a 10 percent increase in overall attendance in dance schools across the country from 2004 to 2005 , and association spokeswoman antje kurz said she expects similar growth this year . " i used to think ballroom dance was old fashioned , but i guess it has become hip , " said thomas eck , a 15-year-old cologne high school student who has been studying ballroom dance along with hinrichs at cologne 's tanzschule breuer for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the film " mad hot ballroom , " inner city kids learned ballroom dancing " at first there were only six of us .
now there are at least 30 kids from my school who go , from different grades , " eck said .
" it 's become popular - it 's not just the total outsiders who take ballroom dance . " the power of reality shows the new popularity of standard dance goes hand in hand with a sudden , widespread presence of ballroom on the big and small screens .
recent movies have had titles like " strictly ballroom , " " shall we dance , " and " mad hot ballroom . "
the latter is a documentary on a social program for underprivileged new york school children , which successfully uses ballroom dance to teach life skills . and since early april , germany has been under the thrall of a reality television show called " let 's dance . "
based on britain 's outrageously popular " strictly come dancing " and its equally beloved american spawn " dancing with the stars , " " let 's dance " pairs b-list celebrities with professional ballroom dancers .
the semi-famous couples then compete , showing off their foxtrots , paso dobles , and rumbas for a professional jury and for viewers at home , who then call in to vote pairs off the show until a winner remains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more teens are taking dance courses in this hamburg school " let 's dance " regularly achieves audience ratings of around 20 percent ; the numbers are higher among 19 to 39 year olds , according to german marketing group quotameter . adtv 's kurz said another reason young people are increasingly drawn to dance class is that the schools themselves have changed .
gone are the dusty institutions that could count on teaching entire classes of preteens preparing for their first formal dance .
today 's schools have updated their music repertoires and added diverse array of activities , offering everything from videoclip dance to same-sex ballroom classes for gay couples . " the schools saw they had to do more to keep their clients .
now they are more like clubs .
they throw parties , have youth nights and workshops , or they 'll take a group out to a musical , " kurz said . etiquette and grace other observers say the trend is tied to a renewed interest in old-fashioned values like polish and politesse .
kids today long for security and constraints , they say .
and ballroom dance - with its evocation of supper-club class - fits the clean-fun bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , jennifer lopez starred in " shall we dance ? "
the adtv has even started a " no-disgrace " program , which calls on its members to go beyond teaching dance steps and enter the world of etiquette education .
they see dance schools as the perfect place for kids to learn how to present themselves in the wider world .
" good etiquette is cool , and keeps you from getting stressed out , " an ad on the adtv web site says . hans georg steinig , who runs the breuer dance school in cologne , agrees .
" my students are being prepared for life .
they will be ready for a job interview .
they learn how to present themselves , " he said . for steinig , teaching dance " is all about social competence .
they have to change partners , and everyone is accepted , tolerated , not judged .
each class ends with a round of applause ; and the kids have to look in each others ' eyes . " " i teach the kids that they are not coming here to learn how to look good on the dance floor , " steinig said . " they are dancing for themselves and for their partner .
learning the steps is the best way to feel the music . " fifteen-year-old eck agrees .
" at the beginning it was a little boring , just to learn the steps .
but then you notice you get better , and it feels differrent when you really learn to move to the music .
it feels good . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart classic gets street treatment in berlin update mozart 's aria " cosi fan tutte " , hip-hop beats and german rap do n't usually go together .

after five hours of discussions , leaders have reached compromises over a wealth tax and parental subsidies , but not health care . kurt beck , the designated leader of the social democratic party , was clearly buoyant after lengthy discussions over key reforms in the german chancellery . " we have come along very nicely and are on the way with all the important issues we wanted to tackle , " beck said .
" as you can see , i 'm very happy . " introducing reforms was seen as a key test for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government .
for weeks the social democrats and christian democrats - who form the coalition - have argued over the reforms .
now it seems they have finally come to agreement , at least over some important issues .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said on tuesday that coalition partners " want a joint success . " wealth taxes a n d aid for n ew pare n ts a " wealth tax " is to be introduced , by which high earners will be obliged to pay more in taxes .
as of january next year individuals with an annual income of 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 316,000 -rrb- or more will have to pay 45 percent income tax - that is an increase of 3 percent . the new system will exclude small businesses , a move pushed for by the conservatives .
markus söder , the secretary general of the bavarian csu party , which is also in the coalition government , said negotiators were keen to avoid burdening small businesses any further . the new tax is expected to free up more than a billion euros for state coffers - money chancellor angela merkel desperately needs to finance yet more costly reforms . if the mo n ey 's right , me n wa n t to raise childre n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents have to juggle work and family the coalition also came to an agreement over benefits for parents who want to take time off from work to look after their newborn babies .
the coalition partners agreed on a 12-month scheme , with an option for another two months if the father also takes paternity leave .
during this time , parents will then receive up to 67 percent of their last net earnings per month , but no more than 1,800 euros . every second man in germany says he would take time off work to raise children , if he had the financial means to do so .
both christian democrats and social democrats were keen to improve the situation for parents , in order to boost germany ’ s low birth rate . " we have agreed on a fundamental change of family policy , " pofalla said . " we do n't expect the costs of the measure to go beyond the calculated 3.8 billion euros , but we are convinced it will become a success , leading to higher birth rates . " the reform plan was spear-headed by family minister ursula von der leyen , who is now hoping to encourage the huge number of working , childless couples in germany to have more babies . the fdp a n d gree n s are dubious but on the streets , people do not appear to see extra money as an incentive to have children .
one man said : " that would n't be a reason for me to father a child . "
a woman said : " if i want to have a baby , i 'll think about it carefully .
more money wo n't influence my decision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green party parliamentary leader renate künast the opposition in government - the free market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - are equally skeptical about the new scheme for parents .
they believe that economic aid is not enough and that the child care system in germany must be improved . " what good does parental aid do when after 12 or 14 months there 's no child care ? " asked dirk niebel , the secretary general of the free-market liberal free democratic party , the largest opposition party .
green party parliamentary leader renate künast meanwhile warned that the coalition agreement on parental aid included a " bag of conjuror 's tricks " that would end up costing tax-payers more . the reforms were key elements in the coalition government 's plan to reform taxes , state benefits and the health service .
but an overhaul of the health system is one area where angela merkel 's government must still make progress . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days the dire predictions once made about germany 's current " grand coalition " government have proven untrue .

more and more teens are revisiting a pastime more often associated with their grandparents ' generation : ballroom dancing . if youth has its finger on the pulse of popular culture , then germany 's heart is beating to the rhythms of the rumba , cha-cha , foxtrot and waltz . mia hinrichs is a 15-year-old high school student from cologne whose passions include playing soccer and watching the " the gilmore girls " on television .
last year , when a boy in her class asked her if she would be his partner in a ballroom dancing class , she had to think twice before she agreed . but that was three classes ago , and mia and her friends - their number has since increased - are still going strong .
" i 'll keep it up if my parents allow me to keep going , " hinrichs said .
" i 'd like to get my bronze and silver -lrb- proficiency-level certificates . -rrb- " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drama of ballroom dancing was shown in baz luhrmann 's film " strictly ballroom " a ballroom dancing class was once an unavoidable rite of passage for middle- and upper-class german teens ; a necessary tool for getting by at social events like formal work functions and weddings .
but those classes began to fall out of favor in the 1980s and 90s . hip trend recently , hamburg dance teacher jan giesel told stern magazine that the " low point was 1996 … that 's when nothing was less cool that couples ' dancing . "
many dance schools did n't survive those decades ; those that did banked on hip hop and aerobics classes . now , however , ballroom is back .
the association of german dance schools -lrb- adtv -rrb- reports a 10 percent increase in overall attendance in dance schools across the country from 2004 to 2005 , and association spokeswoman antje kurz said she expects similar growth this year . " i used to think ballroom dance was old fashioned , but i guess it has become hip , " said thomas eck , a 15-year-old cologne high school student who has been studying ballroom dance along with hinrichs at cologne 's tanzschule breuer for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the film " mad hot ballroom , " inner city kids learned ballroom dancing " at first there were only six of us .
now there are at least 30 kids from my school who go , from different grades , " eck said .
" it 's become popular - it 's not just the total outsiders who take ballroom dance . " the power of reality shows the new popularity of standard dance goes hand in hand with a sudden , widespread presence of ballroom on the big and small screens .
recent movies have had titles like " strictly ballroom , " " shall we dance , " and " mad hot ballroom . "
the latter is a documentary on a social program for underprivileged new york school children , which successfully uses ballroom dance to teach life skills . and since early april , germany has been under the thrall of a reality television show called " let 's dance . "
based on britain 's outrageously popular " strictly come dancing " and its equally beloved american spawn " dancing with the stars , " " let 's dance " pairs b-list celebrities with professional ballroom dancers .
the semi-famous couples then compete , showing off their foxtrots , paso dobles , and rumbas for a professional jury and for viewers at home , who then call in to vote pairs off the show until a winner remains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more teens are taking dance courses in this hamburg school " let 's dance " regularly achieves audience ratings of around 20 percent ; the numbers are higher among 19 to 39 year olds , according to german marketing group quotameter . adtv 's kurz said another reason young people are increasingly drawn to dance class is that the schools themselves have changed .
gone are the dusty institutions that could count on teaching entire classes of preteens preparing for their first formal dance .
today 's schools have updated their music repertoires and added diverse array of activities , offering everything from videoclip dance to same-sex ballroom classes for gay couples . " the schools saw they had to do more to keep their clients .
now they are more like clubs .
they throw parties , have youth nights and workshops , or they 'll take a group out to a musical , " kurz said . etiquette and grace other observers say the trend is tied to a renewed interest in old-fashioned values like polish and politesse .
kids today long for security and constraints , they say .
and ballroom dance - with its evocation of supper-club class - fits the clean-fun bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , jennifer lopez starred in " shall we dance ? "
the adtv has even started a " no-disgrace " program , which calls on its members to go beyond teaching dance steps and enter the world of etiquette education .
they see dance schools as the perfect place for kids to learn how to present themselves in the wider world .
" good etiquette is cool , and keeps you from getting stressed out , " an ad on the adtv web site says . hans georg steinig , who runs the breuer dance school in cologne , agrees .
" my students are being prepared for life .
they will be ready for a job interview .

each class ends with a round of applause ; and the kids have to look in each others ' eyes . " " i teach the kids that they are not coming here to learn how to look good on the dance floor , " steinig said . " they are dancing for themselves and for their partner .
learning the steps is the best way to feel the music . " fifteen-year-old eck agrees .

after five hours of discussions , leaders have reached compromises over a wealth tax and parental subsidies , but not health care . kurt beck , the designated leader of the social democratic party , was clearly buoyant after lengthy discussions over key reforms in the german chancellery . " we have come along very nicely and are on the way with all the important issues we wanted to tackle , " beck said .
" as you can see , i 'm very happy . " introducing reforms was seen as a key test for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government .
for weeks the social democrats and christian democrats - who form the coalition - have argued over the reforms .
now it seems they have finally come to agreement , at least over some important issues .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said on tuesday that coalition partners " want a joint success . " wealth taxes a n d aid for n ew pare n ts a " wealth tax " is to be introduced , by which high earners will be obliged to pay more in taxes .
as of january next year individuals with an annual income of 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 316,000 -rrb- or more will have to pay 45 percent income tax - that is an increase of 3 percent . the new system will exclude small businesses , a move pushed for by the conservatives .
markus söder , the secretary general of the bavarian csu party , which is also in the coalition government , said negotiators were keen to avoid burdening small businesses any further . the new tax is expected to free up more than a billion euros for state coffers - money chancellor angela merkel desperately needs to finance yet more costly reforms . if the mo n ey 's right , me n wa n t to raise childre n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents have to juggle work and family the coalition also came to an agreement over benefits for parents who want to take time off from work to look after their newborn babies .
the coalition partners agreed on a 12-month scheme , with an option for another two months if the father also takes paternity leave .
during this time , parents will then receive up to 67 percent of their last net earnings per month , but no more than 1,800 euros . every second man in germany says he would take time off work to raise children , if he had the financial means to do so .
both christian democrats and social democrats were keen to improve the situation for parents , in order to boost germany ’ s low birth rate . " we have agreed on a fundamental change of family policy , " pofalla said . " we do n't expect the costs of the measure to go beyond the calculated 3.8 billion euros , but we are convinced it will become a success , leading to higher birth rates . " the reform plan was spear-headed by family minister ursula von der leyen , who is now hoping to encourage the huge number of working , childless couples in germany to have more babies . the fdp a n d gree n s are dubious but on the streets , people do not appear to see extra money as an incentive to have children .
one man said : " that would n't be a reason for me to father a child . "
a woman said : " if i want to have a baby , i 'll think about it carefully .
more money wo n't influence my decision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green party parliamentary leader renate künast the opposition in government - the free market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - are equally skeptical about the new scheme for parents .
they believe that economic aid is not enough and that the child care system in germany must be improved . " what good does parental aid do when after 12 or 14 months there 's no child care ? " asked dirk niebel , the secretary general of the free-market liberal free democratic party , the largest opposition party .
green party parliamentary leader renate künast meanwhile warned that the coalition agreement on parental aid included a " bag of conjuror 's tricks " that would end up costing tax-payers more . the reforms were key elements in the coalition government 's plan to reform taxes , state benefits and the health service .

markus söder , the secretary general of the bavarian csu party , which is also in the coalition government , said negotiators were keen to avoid burdening small businesses any further . the new tax is expected to free up more than a billion euros for state coffers - money chancellor angela merkel desperately needs to finance yet more costly reforms . if the mo n ey 's right , me n wa n t to raise childre n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents have to juggle work and family the coalition also came to an agreement over benefits for parents who want to take time off from work to look after their newborn babies .
the coalition partners agreed on a 12-month scheme , with an option for another two months if the father also takes paternity leave .
during this time , parents will then receive up to 67 percent of their last net earnings per month , but no more than 1,800 euros . every second man in germany says he would take time off work to raise children , if he had the financial means to do so .
both christian democrats and social democrats were keen to improve the situation for parents , in order to boost germany ’ s low birth rate . " we have agreed on a fundamental change of family policy , " pofalla said . " we do n't expect the costs of the measure to go beyond the calculated 3.8 billion euros , but we are convinced it will become a success , leading to higher birth rates . " the reform plan was spear-headed by family minister ursula von der leyen , who is now hoping to encourage the huge number of working , childless couples in germany to have more babies . the fdp a n d gree n s are dubious but on the streets , people do not appear to see extra money as an incentive to have children .
one man said : " that would n't be a reason for me to father a child . "
a woman said : " if i want to have a baby , i 'll think about it carefully .
more money wo n't influence my decision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green party parliamentary leader renate künast the opposition in government - the free market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - are equally skeptical about the new scheme for parents .
they believe that economic aid is not enough and that the child care system in germany must be improved . " what good does parental aid do when after 12 or 14 months there 's no child care ? " asked dirk niebel , the secretary general of the free-market liberal free democratic party , the largest opposition party .
green party parliamentary leader renate künast meanwhile warned that the coalition agreement on parental aid included a " bag of conjuror 's tricks " that would end up costing tax-payers more . the reforms were key elements in the coalition government 's plan to reform taxes , state benefits and the health service .

most of them start off with a tourist visa and end up hiding out here illegally .
according to estimates by aid organizations , around one million foreigners live in german without proper resident permits or visas .
they are reluctant to speak about their often catastrophic situation for fear of being deported . frida is one example .
she 's african and , five years ago , was living in slave-like conditions in her home country : she was not permitted to leave the house and had no money of her own .
she fled and came to germany to stay with her aunt .
once here , she met her now fiancé - it was love at first sight . that is still the only way illegal immigrants can gain citizenship here - to marry a german .
another option - for women - is to have a child with a german man . illegal immigra n ts face deportatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german office for migration and refugees if they do not have proper papers , illegal immigrants will be deported since they are committing a criminal offense by staying in the country .
only so-called " deportation barriers " can protract them , said reinhard marx , an immigration lawyer . " legal deportation barriers include protection for internally displaced persons or asylum-seekers or protection from threats to immigrants ' lives , such as torture , should they face it in their home countries , " marx said .
" on the other hand , there are the rules governing the situation here : such as when an immigrant is sick or pregnant , making it inadvisable to deport that person due to health reasons . " illegal immigrants whose identities are not confirmed or who can not reach their home countries due to disrupted transportation routes , and therefore can not leave the country , are given a temporary stay permit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in berlin-kreuzberg many of the illegal immigrants who come to germany have followed relatives who are now living legally in the country .
the largest group of illegal aliens are turkish people , said ute koch of an organization called " living illegally . " " there are children and older people who want to live with their relatives residing in germany , but due to strict regulations illegal immigration is often the only thing left open to them , " she said .
" the possibilities for legal migration are very limited . " lose-lose situatio n once in the country , illegal aliens keep a low profile .
they can not protest if they are paid too little or not at all for their work , as they risk deportation .
employers often take advantage of the dilemma . when ill , illegal immigrants are forced to find a doctor who will treat them anonymously and who expects private payment , which most immigrants can not afford .
they therefore often wait until it is almost too late to receive proper treatment . that was the case with frida .
she had stomach pains for a long time and just took pain killers .
she collapsed one day in the city ; an ambulance took her to the hospital .
doctors discovered that she had gall stones .
she left the hospital after two days , for which she had to pay 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- , and still had not had an operation .
she continued to live with the pain until an aid organization arranged for surgery .
her gall bladder was already perforated ; had she let any more time pass , she would have died . not only had she not been able to pay for the operation - frida also feared police would track her down in the hospital .
though frida has just married and has a legal residence permit , she is still scared to talk .
the years of living illegally have made their mark . public kindergartens and schools are also required to notify police of children or families without proper resident permits .
the result : illegal immigrant children do not receive education , and are forced to stay inside out of fear of drawing attention to themselves by not being in school as required for minors . restricti n g illegal immigratio n harms the eco n omy one would think the easiest solution would be to crack down on illegal aliens even more .
but like in the united states , the demand for them is great .
illegal immigrants provide cheap labor and do the work most germans avoid , thomas straubhaar of the hamburg institute of international economics , said . " even if it sounds odd , it 's true that - given the current regulations - germany is dependent on illegal employment of foreign laborers , " straubhaar said . heidi schmidt -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu must change its immigration policy , experts warn rather than building the walls around " fortress europe " higher , as many eu politicians favor , migration experts say the eu needs a new progressive policy on immigration - for its own good .

after five hours of discussions , leaders have reached compromises over a wealth tax and parental subsidies , but not health care . kurt beck , the designated leader of the social democratic party , was clearly buoyant after lengthy discussions over key reforms in the german chancellery . " we have come along very nicely and are on the way with all the important issues we wanted to tackle , " beck said .
" as you can see , i 'm very happy . " introducing reforms was seen as a key test for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government .
for weeks the social democrats and christian democrats - who form the coalition - have argued over the reforms .
now it seems they have finally come to agreement , at least over some important issues .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said on tuesday that coalition partners " want a joint success . " wealth taxes a n d aid for n ew pare n ts a " wealth tax " is to be introduced , by which high earners will be obliged to pay more in taxes .

after five hours of discussions , leaders have reached compromises over a wealth tax and parental subsidies , but not health care . kurt beck , the designated leader of the social democratic party , was clearly buoyant after lengthy discussions over key reforms in the german chancellery . " we have come along very nicely and are on the way with all the important issues we wanted to tackle , " beck said .
" as you can see , i 'm very happy . " introducing reforms was seen as a key test for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government .
for weeks the social democrats and christian democrats - who form the coalition - have argued over the reforms .
now it seems they have finally come to agreement , at least over some important issues .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said on tuesday that coalition partners " want a joint success . " wealth taxes a n d aid for n ew pare n ts a " wealth tax " is to be introduced , by which high earners will be obliged to pay more in taxes .
as of january next year individuals with an annual income of 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 316,000 -rrb- or more will have to pay 45 percent income tax - that is an increase of 3 percent . the new system will exclude small businesses , a move pushed for by the conservatives .
markus söder , the secretary general of the bavarian csu party , which is also in the coalition government , said negotiators were keen to avoid burdening small businesses any further . the new tax is expected to free up more than a billion euros for state coffers - money chancellor angela merkel desperately needs to finance yet more costly reforms . if the mo n ey 's right , me n wa n t to raise childre n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents have to juggle work and family the coalition also came to an agreement over benefits for parents who want to take time off from work to look after their newborn babies .
the coalition partners agreed on a 12-month scheme , with an option for another two months if the father also takes paternity leave .
during this time , parents will then receive up to 67 percent of their last net earnings per month , but no more than 1,800 euros . every second man in germany says he would take time off work to raise children , if he had the financial means to do so .
both christian democrats and social democrats were keen to improve the situation for parents , in order to boost germany ’ s low birth rate . " we have agreed on a fundamental change of family policy , " pofalla said . " we do n't expect the costs of the measure to go beyond the calculated 3.8 billion euros , but we are convinced it will become a success , leading to higher birth rates . " the reform plan was spear-headed by family minister ursula von der leyen , who is now hoping to encourage the huge number of working , childless couples in germany to have more babies . the fdp a n d gree n s are dubious but on the streets , people do not appear to see extra money as an incentive to have children .

as mourning continues for the late president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , debate about who is best suited to fully integrate germany 's 90,000 jewish migrants from eastern europe has begun . most people involved with the search for a successor understand spiegel was the last council head who consciously lived through the horrors of the holocaust .
whoever will follow in his footsteps is bound to bring with him different views on how to further develop post-war jewish life in germany .
but that 's where the common ground ends . for some prominent members of germany 's jewish community , the outcome of elections for the post of jewish council president , to be held in november , is a foregone conclusion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn decided not to run for the president position in 1999 they believe paul spiegel 's successor can be no other than salomon korn -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 62-year-old jewish architect from frankfurt and one of spiegel 's closest friends .
as the council 's vice-president , korn has played an important role in the expansion of jewish communities across germany . too early to make a decisio n but it 's still much too early to draw any conclusions , according to leading jewish figure micha brumlik .
he said he feels it is inappropriate to focus on a specific name so shortly after spiegel 's death last sunday and would rather concentrate on the abilities the next president should have . " i think we should have somebody at the helm of the council who was born after the second world war , " he said .

while it has been possible to unite some liberal jewish currents under the umbrella of the central council , the integration of the tens of thousands of eastern european jewish migrants is still in its infancy and the council 's next president will need to sort out the ongoing rivalry between jewish migrants and the native german community , according to julius schöps of the felix mendelsohn center in potsdam . " if we look further ahead , we 'll see that there can be no more representatives of the old jewish community in germany following in paul spiegel 's footsteps , " he said .
" we might eventually see someone from the former soviet union taking over as head of the central council .

most of them start off with a tourist visa and end up hiding out here illegally .
according to estimates by aid organizations , around one million foreigners live in german without proper resident permits or visas .
they are reluctant to speak about their often catastrophic situation for fear of being deported . frida is one example .
she 's african and , five years ago , was living in slave-like conditions in her home country : she was not permitted to leave the house and had no money of her own .
she fled and came to germany to stay with her aunt .
once here , she met her now fiancé - it was love at first sight . that is still the only way illegal immigrants can gain citizenship here - to marry a german .
another option - for women - is to have a child with a german man . illegal immigra n ts face deportatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german office for migration and refugees if they do not have proper papers , illegal immigrants will be deported since they are committing a criminal offense by staying in the country .
only so-called " deportation barriers " can protract them , said reinhard marx , an immigration lawyer . " legal deportation barriers include protection for internally displaced persons or asylum-seekers or protection from threats to immigrants ' lives , such as torture , should they face it in their home countries , " marx said .
" on the other hand , there are the rules governing the situation here : such as when an immigrant is sick or pregnant , making it inadvisable to deport that person due to health reasons . " illegal immigrants whose identities are not confirmed or who can not reach their home countries due to disrupted transportation routes , and therefore can not leave the country , are given a temporary stay permit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in berlin-kreuzberg many of the illegal immigrants who come to germany have followed relatives who are now living legally in the country .
the largest group of illegal aliens are turkish people , said ute koch of an organization called " living illegally . " " there are children and older people who want to live with their relatives residing in germany , but due to strict regulations illegal immigration is often the only thing left open to them , " she said .
" the possibilities for legal migration are very limited . " lose-lose situatio n once in the country , illegal aliens keep a low profile .
they can not protest if they are paid too little or not at all for their work , as they risk deportation .
employers often take advantage of the dilemma . when ill , illegal immigrants are forced to find a doctor who will treat them anonymously and who expects private payment , which most immigrants can not afford .
they therefore often wait until it is almost too late to receive proper treatment . that was the case with frida .
she had stomach pains for a long time and just took pain killers .
she collapsed one day in the city ; an ambulance took her to the hospital .
doctors discovered that she had gall stones .
she left the hospital after two days , for which she had to pay 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- , and still had not had an operation .
she continued to live with the pain until an aid organization arranged for surgery .
her gall bladder was already perforated ; had she let any more time pass , she would have died . not only had she not been able to pay for the operation - frida also feared police would track her down in the hospital .
though frida has just married and has a legal residence permit , she is still scared to talk .
the years of living illegally have made their mark . public kindergartens and schools are also required to notify police of children or families without proper resident permits .
the result : illegal immigrant children do not receive education , and are forced to stay inside out of fear of drawing attention to themselves by not being in school as required for minors . restricti n g illegal immigratio n harms the eco n omy one would think the easiest solution would be to crack down on illegal aliens even more .
but like in the united states , the demand for them is great .
illegal immigrants provide cheap labor and do the work most germans avoid , thomas straubhaar of the hamburg institute of international economics , said . " even if it sounds odd , it 's true that - given the current regulations - germany is dependent on illegal employment of foreign laborers , " straubhaar said . heidi schmidt -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu must change its immigration policy , experts warn rather than building the walls around " fortress europe " higher , as many eu politicians favor , migration experts say the eu needs a new progressive policy on immigration - for its own good .

18 , 2006 -rrb- world bank report says migration highly lucrative immigration is n't just about integration , but also big money .

most of them start off with a tourist visa and end up hiding out here illegally .
according to estimates by aid organizations , around one million foreigners live in german without proper resident permits or visas .
they are reluctant to speak about their often catastrophic situation for fear of being deported . frida is one example .
she 's african and , five years ago , was living in slave-like conditions in her home country : she was not permitted to leave the house and had no money of her own .
she fled and came to germany to stay with her aunt .
once here , she met her now fiancé - it was love at first sight . that is still the only way illegal immigrants can gain citizenship here - to marry a german .
another option - for women - is to have a child with a german man . illegal immigra n ts face deportatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german office for migration and refugees if they do not have proper papers , illegal immigrants will be deported since they are committing a criminal offense by staying in the country .
only so-called " deportation barriers " can protract them , said reinhard marx , an immigration lawyer . " legal deportation barriers include protection for internally displaced persons or asylum-seekers or protection from threats to immigrants ' lives , such as torture , should they face it in their home countries , " marx said .
" on the other hand , there are the rules governing the situation here : such as when an immigrant is sick or pregnant , making it inadvisable to deport that person due to health reasons . " illegal immigrants whose identities are not confirmed or who can not reach their home countries due to disrupted transportation routes , and therefore can not leave the country , are given a temporary stay permit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in berlin-kreuzberg many of the illegal immigrants who come to germany have followed relatives who are now living legally in the country .
the largest group of illegal aliens are turkish people , said ute koch of an organization called " living illegally . " " there are children and older people who want to live with their relatives residing in germany , but due to strict regulations illegal immigration is often the only thing left open to them , " she said .
" the possibilities for legal migration are very limited . " lose-lose situatio n once in the country , illegal aliens keep a low profile .

as mourning continues for the late president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , debate about who is best suited to fully integrate germany 's 90,000 jewish migrants from eastern europe has begun . most people involved with the search for a successor understand spiegel was the last council head who consciously lived through the horrors of the holocaust .

" this will certainly make investors think twice before they start building economic relations in the direction of bolivia , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales fulfilled his election campaign promises bolivian top military commanders announced the seizure of 56 oil and gas fields moments after president evo morales formally decreed nationalization of the country 's oil and gas operations , which had been expected . " the state is recovering its property , the possession and total and absolute control of these resources , " morales said at a may day speech at san alberto gas field in southern bolivia . morales called on the country 's " patriots " to " mobilize against any effort by any company to sabotage " the nationalization .
bolivia has the second-largest gas reserves in south america . a frie n dly tour during his tour of latin america , which will include trips to chile , argentina and brazil , steinmeier is expected to discuss political and trade relations after a number of countries in the region have elected left-leaning governments in recent years . according to germany 's foreign ministry , steinmeier 's visits to chile , argentina and brazil are intended to foster this country 's strategic partnership with latin america . foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger played on the world cup motto - a time to make friends - to sum up the overall theme . " if one were to create a specific motto for these visits , then it could well be ' being hosted by friends , " ' jäger said . successive german government and business leaders have , indeed , been eager to maintain close relations with countries in the region even in difficult times of dictatorship and economic degradation . a star eco n omy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tthe first woman to be elected president in chile : michelle bachelet in chile - steimeier 's first stop on tuesday - the german foreign minister will meet with newly-elected president michelle bachelet .
the head of the center-left coalition -lrb- and chile 's first woman president -rrb- spent many years in former communist east germany where she found political asylum during the military dictatorship of augustus pinochet in the 1970s . the german foreign minister will pay tribute to the victims of the military coup by visiting the infamous " villa grimaldi " prison where thousands of chileans were tortured and disappeared . today democratic chile has become latin america 's star economy with annual growth rates of more than 6 percent .
according to claudia zilla , a latin america expert at the berlin-based science and policy research foundation , the country 's economic development coupled with a stable government is hugely attractive for foreign investors . " chile has achieved continuity in its political process , which is based on consensus within society as a whole , " zilla said .
" chileans have been able to create stable political conditions because people there have reached fundamental agreement on common political and economic goals .

in his talks with steinmeier and the german business leaders accompanying him , he will try to convince them that argentina is again a safe place to invest in . " it 's important to remember that not a single german company deserted argentina during this huge crisis , " said barbara konner , who is the latin america spokeswomen of the german chambers of commerce and industry .
" this shows that these companies are still full of hope and confident that the economy there will soon pick up steam again .

most of them start off with a tourist visa and end up hiding out here illegally .
according to estimates by aid organizations , around one million foreigners live in german without proper resident permits or visas .
they are reluctant to speak about their often catastrophic situation for fear of being deported . frida is one example .
she 's african and , five years ago , was living in slave-like conditions in her home country : she was not permitted to leave the house and had no money of her own .
she fled and came to germany to stay with her aunt .
once here , she met her now fiancé - it was love at first sight . that is still the only way illegal immigrants can gain citizenship here - to marry a german .
another option - for women - is to have a child with a german man . illegal immigra n ts face deportatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german office for migration and refugees if they do not have proper papers , illegal immigrants will be deported since they are committing a criminal offense by staying in the country .
only so-called " deportation barriers " can protract them , said reinhard marx , an immigration lawyer . " legal deportation barriers include protection for internally displaced persons or asylum-seekers or protection from threats to immigrants ' lives , such as torture , should they face it in their home countries , " marx said .
" on the other hand , there are the rules governing the situation here : such as when an immigrant is sick or pregnant , making it inadvisable to deport that person due to health reasons . " illegal immigrants whose identities are not confirmed or who can not reach their home countries due to disrupted transportation routes , and therefore can not leave the country , are given a temporary stay permit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in berlin-kreuzberg many of the illegal immigrants who come to germany have followed relatives who are now living legally in the country .
the largest group of illegal aliens are turkish people , said ute koch of an organization called " living illegally . " " there are children and older people who want to live with their relatives residing in germany , but due to strict regulations illegal immigration is often the only thing left open to them , " she said .
" the possibilities for legal migration are very limited . " lose-lose situatio n once in the country , illegal aliens keep a low profile .
they can not protest if they are paid too little or not at all for their work , as they risk deportation .
employers often take advantage of the dilemma . when ill , illegal immigrants are forced to find a doctor who will treat them anonymously and who expects private payment , which most immigrants can not afford .
they therefore often wait until it is almost too late to receive proper treatment . that was the case with frida .
she had stomach pains for a long time and just took pain killers .
she collapsed one day in the city ; an ambulance took her to the hospital .
doctors discovered that she had gall stones .
she left the hospital after two days , for which she had to pay 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- , and still had not had an operation .
she continued to live with the pain until an aid organization arranged for surgery .
her gall bladder was already perforated ; had she let any more time pass , she would have died . not only had she not been able to pay for the operation - frida also feared police would track her down in the hospital .
though frida has just married and has a legal residence permit , she is still scared to talk .
the years of living illegally have made their mark . public kindergartens and schools are also required to notify police of children or families without proper resident permits .
the result : illegal immigrant children do not receive education , and are forced to stay inside out of fear of drawing attention to themselves by not being in school as required for minors . restricti n g illegal immigratio n harms the eco n omy one would think the easiest solution would be to crack down on illegal aliens even more .
but like in the united states , the demand for them is great .
illegal immigrants provide cheap labor and do the work most germans avoid , thomas straubhaar of the hamburg institute of international economics , said . " even if it sounds odd , it 's true that - given the current regulations - germany is dependent on illegal employment of foreign laborers , " straubhaar said . heidi schmidt -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu must change its immigration policy , experts warn rather than building the walls around " fortress europe " higher , as many eu politicians favor , migration experts say the eu needs a new progressive policy on immigration - for its own good .

governments consciously hinder the media 's work by passing laws that restrict the press , fostering an atmosphere of intimidation and fear , harassing and imprisoning journalists or even killing them . the media , however , continue to play a crucial role in strengthening democratic principles and promoting the development of civil society .
recognizing the media as a force of change , the un observes world press freedom day on may 3 every year . dw-world 's coverage of recent events in germany and europe - ranging from the raid on the offices of a political magazine in the german town of potsdam to the international protests following the publication of mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper - shows that freedom of the press remains of utmost importance for the functioning of western democracies .
but it also highlights how the free media can turn into a point of contention in intercultural relations . dw-world.de is freedom of the press dying out in germany ?
the case of the two journalists charged for exposing state secrets has raised questions about press freedom .
dw-world.de spoke with hendrik zörner of the german journalists ' association about the issue .

more and more teens are revisiting a pastime more often associated with their grandparents ' generation : ballroom dancing . if youth has its finger on the pulse of popular culture , then germany 's heart is beating to the rhythms of the rumba , cha-cha , foxtrot and waltz . mia hinrichs is a 15-year-old high school student from cologne whose passions include playing soccer and watching the " the gilmore girls " on television .
last year , when a boy in her class asked her if she would be his partner in a ballroom dancing class , she had to think twice before she agreed . but that was three classes ago , and mia and her friends - their number has since increased - are still going strong .
" i 'll keep it up if my parents allow me to keep going , " hinrichs said .
" i 'd like to get my bronze and silver -lrb- proficiency-level certificates . -rrb- " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drama of ballroom dancing was shown in baz luhrmann 's film " strictly ballroom " a ballroom dancing class was once an unavoidable rite of passage for middle- and upper-class german teens ; a necessary tool for getting by at social events like formal work functions and weddings .
but those classes began to fall out of favor in the 1980s and 90s . hip trend recently , hamburg dance teacher jan giesel told stern magazine that the " low point was 1996 … that 's when nothing was less cool that couples ' dancing . "
many dance schools did n't survive those decades ; those that did banked on hip hop and aerobics classes . now , however , ballroom is back .
the association of german dance schools -lrb- adtv -rrb- reports a 10 percent increase in overall attendance in dance schools across the country from 2004 to 2005 , and association spokeswoman antje kurz said she expects similar growth this year . " i used to think ballroom dance was old fashioned , but i guess it has become hip , " said thomas eck , a 15-year-old cologne high school student who has been studying ballroom dance along with hinrichs at cologne 's tanzschule breuer for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the film " mad hot ballroom , " inner city kids learned ballroom dancing " at first there were only six of us .
now there are at least 30 kids from my school who go , from different grades , " eck said .
" it 's become popular - it 's not just the total outsiders who take ballroom dance . " the power of reality shows the new popularity of standard dance goes hand in hand with a sudden , widespread presence of ballroom on the big and small screens .
recent movies have had titles like " strictly ballroom , " " shall we dance , " and " mad hot ballroom . "
the latter is a documentary on a social program for underprivileged new york school children , which successfully uses ballroom dance to teach life skills . and since early april , germany has been under the thrall of a reality television show called " let 's dance . "
based on britain 's outrageously popular " strictly come dancing " and its equally beloved american spawn " dancing with the stars , " " let 's dance " pairs b-list celebrities with professional ballroom dancers .
the semi-famous couples then compete , showing off their foxtrots , paso dobles , and rumbas for a professional jury and for viewers at home , who then call in to vote pairs off the show until a winner remains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more teens are taking dance courses in this hamburg school " let 's dance " regularly achieves audience ratings of around 20 percent ; the numbers are higher among 19 to 39 year olds , according to german marketing group quotameter . adtv 's kurz said another reason young people are increasingly drawn to dance class is that the schools themselves have changed .
gone are the dusty institutions that could count on teaching entire classes of preteens preparing for their first formal dance .
today 's schools have updated their music repertoires and added diverse array of activities , offering everything from videoclip dance to same-sex ballroom classes for gay couples . " the schools saw they had to do more to keep their clients .
now they are more like clubs .
they throw parties , have youth nights and workshops , or they 'll take a group out to a musical , " kurz said . etiquette and grace other observers say the trend is tied to a renewed interest in old-fashioned values like polish and politesse .
kids today long for security and constraints , they say .
and ballroom dance - with its evocation of supper-club class - fits the clean-fun bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , jennifer lopez starred in " shall we dance ? "
the adtv has even started a " no-disgrace " program , which calls on its members to go beyond teaching dance steps and enter the world of etiquette education .
they see dance schools as the perfect place for kids to learn how to present themselves in the wider world .
" good etiquette is cool , and keeps you from getting stressed out , " an ad on the adtv web site says . hans georg steinig , who runs the breuer dance school in cologne , agrees .
" my students are being prepared for life .
they will be ready for a job interview .
they learn how to present themselves , " he said . for steinig , teaching dance " is all about social competence .
they have to change partners , and everyone is accepted , tolerated , not judged .
each class ends with a round of applause ; and the kids have to look in each others ' eyes . " " i teach the kids that they are not coming here to learn how to look good on the dance floor , " steinig said . " they are dancing for themselves and for their partner .
learning the steps is the best way to feel the music . " fifteen-year-old eck agrees .
" at the beginning it was a little boring , just to learn the steps .
but then you notice you get better , and it feels differrent when you really learn to move to the music .
it feels good . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart classic gets street treatment in berlin update mozart 's aria " cosi fan tutte " , hip-hop beats and german rap do n't usually go together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.05.2006 ballroom dancing is mad hot trend among german teens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teens are learning social competence along with dance steps , according to one teacher for increasing numbers of german teenagers , partying no longer means long nights at the disco .
more and more teens are revisiting a pastime more often associated with their grandparents ' generation : ballroom dancing . if youth has its finger on the pulse of popular culture , then germany 's heart is beating to the rhythms of the rumba , cha-cha , foxtrot and waltz . mia hinrichs is a 15-year-old high school student from cologne whose passions include playing soccer and watching the " the gilmore girls " on television .
last year , when a boy in her class asked her if she would be his partner in a ballroom dancing class , she had to think twice before she agreed . but that was three classes ago , and mia and her friends - their number has since increased - are still going strong .
" i 'll keep it up if my parents allow me to keep going , " hinrichs said .
" i 'd like to get my bronze and silver -lrb- proficiency-level certificates . -rrb- " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drama of ballroom dancing was shown in baz luhrmann 's film " strictly ballroom " a ballroom dancing class was once an unavoidable rite of passage for middle- and upper-class german teens ; a necessary tool for getting by at social events like formal work functions and weddings .
but those classes began to fall out of favor in the 1980s and 90s . hip trend recently , hamburg dance teacher jan giesel told stern magazine that the " low point was 1996 … that 's when nothing was less cool that couples ' dancing . "
many dance schools did n't survive those decades ; those that did banked on hip hop and aerobics classes . now , however , ballroom is back .
the association of german dance schools -lrb- adtv -rrb- reports a 10 percent increase in overall attendance in dance schools across the country from 2004 to 2005 , and association spokeswoman antje kurz said she expects similar growth this year . " i used to think ballroom dance was old fashioned , but i guess it has become hip , " said thomas eck , a 15-year-old cologne high school student who has been studying ballroom dance along with hinrichs at cologne 's tanzschule breuer for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the film " mad hot ballroom , " inner city kids learned ballroom dancing " at first there were only six of us .
now there are at least 30 kids from my school who go , from different grades , " eck said .
" it 's become popular - it 's not just the total outsiders who take ballroom dance . " the power of reality shows the new popularity of standard dance goes hand in hand with a sudden , widespread presence of ballroom on the big and small screens .
recent movies have had titles like " strictly ballroom , " " shall we dance , " and " mad hot ballroom . "
the latter is a documentary on a social program for underprivileged new york school children , which successfully uses ballroom dance to teach life skills . and since early april , germany has been under the thrall of a reality television show called " let 's dance . "
based on britain 's outrageously popular " strictly come dancing " and its equally beloved american spawn " dancing with the stars , " " let 's dance " pairs b-list celebrities with professional ballroom dancers .
the semi-famous couples then compete , showing off their foxtrots , paso dobles , and rumbas for a professional jury and for viewers at home , who then call in to vote pairs off the show until a winner remains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more teens are taking dance courses in this hamburg school " let 's dance " regularly achieves audience ratings of around 20 percent ; the numbers are higher among 19 to 39 year olds , according to german marketing group quotameter . adtv 's kurz said another reason young people are increasingly drawn to dance class is that the schools themselves have changed .
gone are the dusty institutions that could count on teaching entire classes of preteens preparing for their first formal dance .
today 's schools have updated their music repertoires and added diverse array of activities , offering everything from videoclip dance to same-sex ballroom classes for gay couples . " the schools saw they had to do more to keep their clients .
now they are more like clubs .
they throw parties , have youth nights and workshops , or they 'll take a group out to a musical , " kurz said . etiquette and grace other observers say the trend is tied to a renewed interest in old-fashioned values like polish and politesse .
kids today long for security and constraints , they say .
and ballroom dance - with its evocation of supper-club class - fits the clean-fun bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , jennifer lopez starred in " shall we dance ? "
the adtv has even started a " no-disgrace " program , which calls on its members to go beyond teaching dance steps and enter the world of etiquette education .
they see dance schools as the perfect place for kids to learn how to present themselves in the wider world .
" good etiquette is cool , and keeps you from getting stressed out , " an ad on the adtv web site says . hans georg steinig , who runs the breuer dance school in cologne , agrees .
" my students are being prepared for life .
they will be ready for a job interview .
they learn how to present themselves , " he said . for steinig , teaching dance " is all about social competence .
they have to change partners , and everyone is accepted , tolerated , not judged .
each class ends with a round of applause ; and the kids have to look in each others ' eyes . " " i teach the kids that they are not coming here to learn how to look good on the dance floor , " steinig said . " they are dancing for themselves and for their partner .
learning the steps is the best way to feel the music . " fifteen-year-old eck agrees .
" at the beginning it was a little boring , just to learn the steps .
but then you notice you get better , and it feels differrent when you really learn to move to the music .
it feels good . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart classic gets street treatment in berlin update mozart 's aria " cosi fan tutte " , hip-hop beats and german rap do n't usually go together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.05.2006 illegals in germany face similar problems as those in us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most illegal immigrants in germany still come from turkey with the status and protests of illegal immigrants in the united states making the headlines over the past days and weeks , the same question can be posed for germany : how do illegal immigrants fare in this country ? many illegal immigrants in germany come from africa , eastern europe or latin america .
most of them start off with a tourist visa and end up hiding out here illegally .
according to estimates by aid organizations , around one million foreigners live in german without proper resident permits or visas .
they are reluctant to speak about their often catastrophic situation for fear of being deported . frida is one example .
she 's african and , five years ago , was living in slave-like conditions in her home country : she was not permitted to leave the house and had no money of her own .
she fled and came to germany to stay with her aunt .
once here , she met her now fiancé - it was love at first sight . that is still the only way illegal immigrants can gain citizenship here - to marry a german .
another option - for women - is to have a child with a german man . illegal immigra n ts face deportatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german office for migration and refugees if they do not have proper papers , illegal immigrants will be deported since they are committing a criminal offense by staying in the country .
only so-called " deportation barriers " can protract them , said reinhard marx , an immigration lawyer . " legal deportation barriers include protection for internally displaced persons or asylum-seekers or protection from threats to immigrants ' lives , such as torture , should they face it in their home countries , " marx said .
" on the other hand , there are the rules governing the situation here : such as when an immigrant is sick or pregnant , making it inadvisable to deport that person due to health reasons . " illegal immigrants whose identities are not confirmed or who can not reach their home countries due to disrupted transportation routes , and therefore can not leave the country , are given a temporary stay permit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in berlin-kreuzberg many of the illegal immigrants who come to germany have followed relatives who are now living legally in the country .
the largest group of illegal aliens are turkish people , said ute koch of an organization called " living illegally . " " there are children and older people who want to live with their relatives residing in germany , but due to strict regulations illegal immigration is often the only thing left open to them , " she said .
" the possibilities for legal migration are very limited . " lose-lose situatio n once in the country , illegal aliens keep a low profile .
they can not protest if they are paid too little or not at all for their work , as they risk deportation .
employers often take advantage of the dilemma . when ill , illegal immigrants are forced to find a doctor who will treat them anonymously and who expects private payment , which most immigrants can not afford .
they therefore often wait until it is almost too late to receive proper treatment . that was the case with frida .
she had stomach pains for a long time and just took pain killers .
she collapsed one day in the city ; an ambulance took her to the hospital .
doctors discovered that she had gall stones .
she left the hospital after two days , for which she had to pay 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- , and still had not had an operation .
she continued to live with the pain until an aid organization arranged for surgery .
her gall bladder was already perforated ; had she let any more time pass , she would have died . not only had she not been able to pay for the operation - frida also feared police would track her down in the hospital .
though frida has just married and has a legal residence permit , she is still scared to talk .
the years of living illegally have made their mark . public kindergartens and schools are also required to notify police of children or families without proper resident permits .
the result : illegal immigrant children do not receive education , and are forced to stay inside out of fear of drawing attention to themselves by not being in school as required for minors . restricti n g illegal immigratio n harms the eco n omy one would think the easiest solution would be to crack down on illegal aliens even more .
but like in the united states , the demand for them is great .
illegal immigrants provide cheap labor and do the work most germans avoid , thomas straubhaar of the hamburg institute of international economics , said . " even if it sounds odd , it 's true that - given the current regulations - germany is dependent on illegal employment of foreign laborers , " straubhaar said . heidi schmidt -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu must change its immigration policy , experts warn rather than building the walls around " fortress europe " higher , as many eu politicians favor , migration experts say the eu needs a new progressive policy on immigration - for its own good .

18 , 2006 -rrb- world bank report says migration highly lucrative immigration is n't just about integration , but also big money .
a new world bank report says migrant workers send billions to their families back home - strengthening local economies as well as helping rich countries .
-lrb- jan .

" the two hostages were taken in three suvs this morning to the airport , " a security guard at the embassy told afp .
officials at the embassy declined to comment . rene bräeunlich , 32 , and thomas nitzschke , 28 , were freed tuesday after being held for more than three months in captivity . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , in the midst of a state visit to chile , said he had spoken to the men , thomas nitzschke and rene bräunlich , and that they were well , considering the circumstances , the german news agency dpa reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the hostages are free , thank god , " reads the sign held by leipzig 's mayor , burkhard jung " i am happy to tell you that the two kidnapped leipzigers , thomas nitzschke and rene bräunlich , are , as of today , free again , " steinmeier said from santiago de chile .
" after more than three months of inhumane conditions , they are now safely in german hands in iraq and will , according to the current plans , return to germany tomorrow . "
" i am very relieved and happy that the german hostages in iraq have been freed , " chancellor angela merkel said of the men 's release . so far , it appears that the men were let go as a result of negotiations with the hostage-takers .
the german foreign ministry had established a task force devoted to the release of the hostages shortly after they were kidnapped .
it was not clear whether ransom money had been paid .
in a press conference on tuesday evening , task force member reinhard silberberg thanked those who had contributed to the men being let go .
he said that , as in the past , the government would not comment on the circumstances of their release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier continually called for calm during the hostage ordeal nitzschke , 28 , and bräunlich , 32 , were kidnapped in northern iraq while working for the german engineering firm cryotec .
their kidnappers circulated a series of three videos during the men 's period of captivity in which the hostage-takers laid out demands for their release .
in the last video , which appeared on the internet on april 9 , nitzschke spoke , calling for help .
" we ca n't stand it much longer , " he said .
the men had been threatened with execution .
their captors , a group called ansar al-tawheed wal sunna -lrb- followers of unity and prophetic tradition -rrb- , demanded the release of all iraqis held in us-run prisons and told germany to stop giving help to the us and iraqi authorities there . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig keeps candles burning for german hostages hundreds gathered in leipzig on monday to show their solidarity with the two german engineers still being held hostage in iraq .
the organizers called for more support and solidarity from the public .
-lrb- april 25 , 2006 -rrb- public frustration mounts in case of german hostages the continued captivity of german engineers taken hostage in iraq over two months ago is leading to a sense among some germans that the government is not doing enough to secure their release .

" this will certainly make investors think twice before they start building economic relations in the direction of bolivia , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales fulfilled his election campaign promises bolivian top military commanders announced the seizure of 56 oil and gas fields moments after president evo morales formally decreed nationalization of the country 's oil and gas operations , which had been expected . " the state is recovering its property , the possession and total and absolute control of these resources , " morales said at a may day speech at san alberto gas field in southern bolivia . morales called on the country 's " patriots " to " mobilize against any effort by any company to sabotage " the nationalization .
bolivia has the second-largest gas reserves in south america . a frie n dly tour during his tour of latin america , which will include trips to chile , argentina and brazil , steinmeier is expected to discuss political and trade relations after a number of countries in the region have elected left-leaning governments in recent years . according to germany 's foreign ministry , steinmeier 's visits to chile , argentina and brazil are intended to foster this country 's strategic partnership with latin america . foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger played on the world cup motto - a time to make friends - to sum up the overall theme . " if one were to create a specific motto for these visits , then it could well be ' being hosted by friends , " ' jäger said . successive german government and business leaders have , indeed , been eager to maintain close relations with countries in the region even in difficult times of dictatorship and economic degradation . a star eco n omy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tthe first woman to be elected president in chile : michelle bachelet in chile - steimeier 's first stop on tuesday - the german foreign minister will meet with newly-elected president michelle bachelet .
the head of the center-left coalition -lrb- and chile 's first woman president -rrb- spent many years in former communist east germany where she found political asylum during the military dictatorship of augustus pinochet in the 1970s . the german foreign minister will pay tribute to the victims of the military coup by visiting the infamous " villa grimaldi " prison where thousands of chileans were tortured and disappeared . today democratic chile has become latin america 's star economy with annual growth rates of more than 6 percent .
according to claudia zilla , a latin america expert at the berlin-based science and policy research foundation , the country 's economic development coupled with a stable government is hugely attractive for foreign investors . " chile has achieved continuity in its political process , which is based on consensus within society as a whole , " zilla said .
" chileans have been able to create stable political conditions because people there have reached fundamental agreement on common political and economic goals . " getti n g the house i n order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentinian president nestor kirchner in argentina , president nestor kirchner is only just beginning to get his country in order after a disastrous collapse of the economy and state finances five years ago .
in his talks with steinmeier and the german business leaders accompanying him , he will try to convince them that argentina is again a safe place to invest in . " it 's important to remember that not a single german company deserted argentina during this huge crisis , " said barbara konner , who is the latin america spokeswomen of the german chambers of commerce and industry .
" this shows that these companies are still full of hope and confident that the economy there will soon pick up steam again . " i n ter n atio n al ambitio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian president lula da silva in brazil , the german foreign minister 's talks with president lula da silva will also focus on bilateral trade as well as the two countries ' efforts to play a more prominent role in the united nations . germany and brazil have teamed up with india and japan in a bid to become permanent members of the united nations ' security council . but steinmeier 's visit to the country may also be welcome by the leftist brazilian president as he is seeking to shore up his political fortunes ahead of october 's presidential election . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de last chance talks for g4 un hopefuls diplomats from germany , india , japan , brazil and the african union meet in london on monday to thrash out what could be their last chance at agreeing a common strategy for expanding the un security council by september .

most of them start off with a tourist visa and end up hiding out here illegally .
according to estimates by aid organizations , around one million foreigners live in german without proper resident permits or visas .
they are reluctant to speak about their often catastrophic situation for fear of being deported . frida is one example .
she 's african and , five years ago , was living in slave-like conditions in her home country : she was not permitted to leave the house and had no money of her own .
she fled and came to germany to stay with her aunt .
once here , she met her now fiancé - it was love at first sight . that is still the only way illegal immigrants can gain citizenship here - to marry a german .
another option - for women - is to have a child with a german man . illegal immigra n ts face deportatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german office for migration and refugees if they do not have proper papers , illegal immigrants will be deported since they are committing a criminal offense by staying in the country .
only so-called " deportation barriers " can protract them , said reinhard marx , an immigration lawyer . " legal deportation barriers include protection for internally displaced persons or asylum-seekers or protection from threats to immigrants ' lives , such as torture , should they face it in their home countries , " marx said .
" on the other hand , there are the rules governing the situation here : such as when an immigrant is sick or pregnant , making it inadvisable to deport that person due to health reasons . " illegal immigrants whose identities are not confirmed or who can not reach their home countries due to disrupted transportation routes , and therefore can not leave the country , are given a temporary stay permit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in berlin-kreuzberg many of the illegal immigrants who come to germany have followed relatives who are now living legally in the country .
the largest group of illegal aliens are turkish people , said ute koch of an organization called " living illegally . " " there are children and older people who want to live with their relatives residing in germany , but due to strict regulations illegal immigration is often the only thing left open to them , " she said .
" the possibilities for legal migration are very limited . " lose-lose situatio n once in the country , illegal aliens keep a low profile .
they can not protest if they are paid too little or not at all for their work , as they risk deportation .
employers often take advantage of the dilemma . when ill , illegal immigrants are forced to find a doctor who will treat them anonymously and who expects private payment , which most immigrants can not afford .
they therefore often wait until it is almost too late to receive proper treatment . that was the case with frida .
she had stomach pains for a long time and just took pain killers .
she collapsed one day in the city ; an ambulance took her to the hospital .
doctors discovered that she had gall stones .
she left the hospital after two days , for which she had to pay 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- , and still had not had an operation .
she continued to live with the pain until an aid organization arranged for surgery .
her gall bladder was already perforated ; had she let any more time pass , she would have died . not only had she not been able to pay for the operation - frida also feared police would track her down in the hospital .
though frida has just married and has a legal residence permit , she is still scared to talk .
the years of living illegally have made their mark . public kindergartens and schools are also required to notify police of children or families without proper resident permits .
the result : illegal immigrant children do not receive education , and are forced to stay inside out of fear of drawing attention to themselves by not being in school as required for minors . restricti n g illegal immigratio n harms the eco n omy one would think the easiest solution would be to crack down on illegal aliens even more .
but like in the united states , the demand for them is great .

most of them start off with a tourist visa and end up hiding out here illegally .
according to estimates by aid organizations , around one million foreigners live in german without proper resident permits or visas .
they are reluctant to speak about their often catastrophic situation for fear of being deported . frida is one example .
she 's african and , five years ago , was living in slave-like conditions in her home country : she was not permitted to leave the house and had no money of her own .
she fled and came to germany to stay with her aunt .
once here , she met her now fiancé - it was love at first sight . that is still the only way illegal immigrants can gain citizenship here - to marry a german .
another option - for women - is to have a child with a german man . illegal immigra n ts face deportatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german office for migration and refugees if they do not have proper papers , illegal immigrants will be deported since they are committing a criminal offense by staying in the country .
only so-called " deportation barriers " can protract them , said reinhard marx , an immigration lawyer . " legal deportation barriers include protection for internally displaced persons or asylum-seekers or protection from threats to immigrants ' lives , such as torture , should they face it in their home countries , " marx said .
" on the other hand , there are the rules governing the situation here : such as when an immigrant is sick or pregnant , making it inadvisable to deport that person due to health reasons . " illegal immigrants whose identities are not confirmed or who can not reach their home countries due to disrupted transportation routes , and therefore can not leave the country , are given a temporary stay permit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in berlin-kreuzberg many of the illegal immigrants who come to germany have followed relatives who are now living legally in the country .
the largest group of illegal aliens are turkish people , said ute koch of an organization called " living illegally . " " there are children and older people who want to live with their relatives residing in germany , but due to strict regulations illegal immigration is often the only thing left open to them , " she said .
" the possibilities for legal migration are very limited . " lose-lose situatio n once in the country , illegal aliens keep a low profile .
they can not protest if they are paid too little or not at all for their work , as they risk deportation .
employers often take advantage of the dilemma . when ill , illegal immigrants are forced to find a doctor who will treat them anonymously and who expects private payment , which most immigrants can not afford .
they therefore often wait until it is almost too late to receive proper treatment . that was the case with frida .
she had stomach pains for a long time and just took pain killers .
she collapsed one day in the city ; an ambulance took her to the hospital .
doctors discovered that she had gall stones .
she left the hospital after two days , for which she had to pay 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- , and still had not had an operation .
she continued to live with the pain until an aid organization arranged for surgery .
her gall bladder was already perforated ; had she let any more time pass , she would have died . not only had she not been able to pay for the operation - frida also feared police would track her down in the hospital .
though frida has just married and has a legal residence permit , she is still scared to talk .
the years of living illegally have made their mark . public kindergartens and schools are also required to notify police of children or families without proper resident permits .
the result : illegal immigrant children do not receive education , and are forced to stay inside out of fear of drawing attention to themselves by not being in school as required for minors . restricti n g illegal immigratio n harms the eco n omy one would think the easiest solution would be to crack down on illegal aliens even more .
but like in the united states , the demand for them is great .
illegal immigrants provide cheap labor and do the work most germans avoid , thomas straubhaar of the hamburg institute of international economics , said . " even if it sounds odd , it 's true that - given the current regulations - germany is dependent on illegal employment of foreign laborers , " straubhaar said . heidi schmidt -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu must change its immigration policy , experts warn rather than building the walls around " fortress europe " higher , as many eu politicians favor , migration experts say the eu needs a new progressive policy on immigration - for its own good .

governments consciously hinder the media 's work by passing laws that restrict the press , fostering an atmosphere of intimidation and fear , harassing and imprisoning journalists or even killing them . the media , however , continue to play a crucial role in strengthening democratic principles and promoting the development of civil society .
recognizing the media as a force of change , the un observes world press freedom day on may 3 every year . dw-world 's coverage of recent events in germany and europe - ranging from the raid on the offices of a political magazine in the german town of potsdam to the international protests following the publication of mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper - shows that freedom of the press remains of utmost importance for the functioning of western democracies .
but it also highlights how the free media can turn into a point of contention in intercultural relations . dw-world.de is freedom of the press dying out in germany ?
the case of the two journalists charged for exposing state secrets has raised questions about press freedom .

as mourning continues for the late president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , debate about who is best suited to fully integrate germany 's 90,000 jewish migrants from eastern europe has begun . most people involved with the search for a successor understand spiegel was the last council head who consciously lived through the horrors of the holocaust .
whoever will follow in his footsteps is bound to bring with him different views on how to further develop post-war jewish life in germany .
but that 's where the common ground ends . for some prominent members of germany 's jewish community , the outcome of elections for the post of jewish council president , to be held in november , is a foregone conclusion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn decided not to run for the president position in 1999 they believe paul spiegel 's successor can be no other than salomon korn -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 62-year-old jewish architect from frankfurt and one of spiegel 's closest friends .
as the council 's vice-president , korn has played an important role in the expansion of jewish communities across germany . too early to make a decisio n but it 's still much too early to draw any conclusions , according to leading jewish figure micha brumlik .
he said he feels it is inappropriate to focus on a specific name so shortly after spiegel 's death last sunday and would rather concentrate on the abilities the next president should have . " i think we should have somebody at the helm of the council who was born after the second world war , " he said .

after five hours of discussions , leaders have reached compromises over a wealth tax and parental subsidies , but not health care . kurt beck , the designated leader of the social democratic party , was clearly buoyant after lengthy discussions over key reforms in the german chancellery . " we have come along very nicely and are on the way with all the important issues we wanted to tackle , " beck said .
" as you can see , i 'm very happy . " introducing reforms was seen as a key test for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government .
for weeks the social democrats and christian democrats - who form the coalition - have argued over the reforms .
now it seems they have finally come to agreement , at least over some important issues .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said on tuesday that coalition partners " want a joint success . " wealth taxes a n d aid for n ew pare n ts a " wealth tax " is to be introduced , by which high earners will be obliged to pay more in taxes .
as of january next year individuals with an annual income of 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 316,000 -rrb- or more will have to pay 45 percent income tax - that is an increase of 3 percent . the new system will exclude small businesses , a move pushed for by the conservatives .
markus söder , the secretary general of the bavarian csu party , which is also in the coalition government , said negotiators were keen to avoid burdening small businesses any further . the new tax is expected to free up more than a billion euros for state coffers - money chancellor angela merkel desperately needs to finance yet more costly reforms . if the mo n ey 's right , me n wa n t to raise childre n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents have to juggle work and family the coalition also came to an agreement over benefits for parents who want to take time off from work to look after their newborn babies .
the coalition partners agreed on a 12-month scheme , with an option for another two months if the father also takes paternity leave .
during this time , parents will then receive up to 67 percent of their last net earnings per month , but no more than 1,800 euros . every second man in germany says he would take time off work to raise children , if he had the financial means to do so .
both christian democrats and social democrats were keen to improve the situation for parents , in order to boost germany ’ s low birth rate . " we have agreed on a fundamental change of family policy , " pofalla said . " we do n't expect the costs of the measure to go beyond the calculated 3.8 billion euros , but we are convinced it will become a success , leading to higher birth rates . " the reform plan was spear-headed by family minister ursula von der leyen , who is now hoping to encourage the huge number of working , childless couples in germany to have more babies . the fdp a n d gree n s are dubious but on the streets , people do not appear to see extra money as an incentive to have children .
one man said : " that would n't be a reason for me to father a child . "
a woman said : " if i want to have a baby , i 'll think about it carefully .
more money wo n't influence my decision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green party parliamentary leader renate künast the opposition in government - the free market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - are equally skeptical about the new scheme for parents .
they believe that economic aid is not enough and that the child care system in germany must be improved . " what good does parental aid do when after 12 or 14 months there 's no child care ? " asked dirk niebel , the secretary general of the free-market liberal free democratic party , the largest opposition party .
green party parliamentary leader renate künast meanwhile warned that the coalition agreement on parental aid included a " bag of conjuror 's tricks " that would end up costing tax-payers more . the reforms were key elements in the coalition government 's plan to reform taxes , state benefits and the health service .

most of them start off with a tourist visa and end up hiding out here illegally .
according to estimates by aid organizations , around one million foreigners live in german without proper resident permits or visas .
they are reluctant to speak about their often catastrophic situation for fear of being deported . frida is one example .
she 's african and , five years ago , was living in slave-like conditions in her home country : she was not permitted to leave the house and had no money of her own .
she fled and came to germany to stay with her aunt .
once here , she met her now fiancé - it was love at first sight . that is still the only way illegal immigrants can gain citizenship here - to marry a german .
another option - for women - is to have a child with a german man . illegal immigra n ts face deportatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german office for migration and refugees if they do not have proper papers , illegal immigrants will be deported since they are committing a criminal offense by staying in the country .
only so-called " deportation barriers " can protract them , said reinhard marx , an immigration lawyer . " legal deportation barriers include protection for internally displaced persons or asylum-seekers or protection from threats to immigrants ' lives , such as torture , should they face it in their home countries , " marx said .
" on the other hand , there are the rules governing the situation here : such as when an immigrant is sick or pregnant , making it inadvisable to deport that person due to health reasons . " illegal immigrants whose identities are not confirmed or who can not reach their home countries due to disrupted transportation routes , and therefore can not leave the country , are given a temporary stay permit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in berlin-kreuzberg many of the illegal immigrants who come to germany have followed relatives who are now living legally in the country .
the largest group of illegal aliens are turkish people , said ute koch of an organization called " living illegally . " " there are children and older people who want to live with their relatives residing in germany , but due to strict regulations illegal immigration is often the only thing left open to them , " she said .
" the possibilities for legal migration are very limited . " lose-lose situatio n once in the country , illegal aliens keep a low profile .
they can not protest if they are paid too little or not at all for their work , as they risk deportation .
employers often take advantage of the dilemma . when ill , illegal immigrants are forced to find a doctor who will treat them anonymously and who expects private payment , which most immigrants can not afford .
they therefore often wait until it is almost too late to receive proper treatment . that was the case with frida .
she had stomach pains for a long time and just took pain killers .
she collapsed one day in the city ; an ambulance took her to the hospital .
doctors discovered that she had gall stones .
she left the hospital after two days , for which she had to pay 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- , and still had not had an operation .
she continued to live with the pain until an aid organization arranged for surgery .
her gall bladder was already perforated ; had she let any more time pass , she would have died . not only had she not been able to pay for the operation - frida also feared police would track her down in the hospital .
though frida has just married and has a legal residence permit , she is still scared to talk .
the years of living illegally have made their mark . public kindergartens and schools are also required to notify police of children or families without proper resident permits .
the result : illegal immigrant children do not receive education , and are forced to stay inside out of fear of drawing attention to themselves by not being in school as required for minors . restricti n g illegal immigratio n harms the eco n omy one would think the easiest solution would be to crack down on illegal aliens even more .
but like in the united states , the demand for them is great .
illegal immigrants provide cheap labor and do the work most germans avoid , thomas straubhaar of the hamburg institute of international economics , said . " even if it sounds odd , it 's true that - given the current regulations - germany is dependent on illegal employment of foreign laborers , " straubhaar said . heidi schmidt -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu must change its immigration policy , experts warn rather than building the walls around " fortress europe " higher , as many eu politicians favor , migration experts say the eu needs a new progressive policy on immigration - for its own good .

then , a year ago , it finally put a new immigration law on the books which seems to have achieved very little .

most of them start off with a tourist visa and end up hiding out here illegally .
according to estimates by aid organizations , around one million foreigners live in german without proper resident permits or visas .
they are reluctant to speak about their often catastrophic situation for fear of being deported . frida is one example .
she 's african and , five years ago , was living in slave-like conditions in her home country : she was not permitted to leave the house and had no money of her own .
she fled and came to germany to stay with her aunt .
once here , she met her now fiancé - it was love at first sight . that is still the only way illegal immigrants can gain citizenship here - to marry a german .
another option - for women - is to have a child with a german man . illegal immigra n ts face deportatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german office for migration and refugees if they do not have proper papers , illegal immigrants will be deported since they are committing a criminal offense by staying in the country .
only so-called " deportation barriers " can protract them , said reinhard marx , an immigration lawyer . " legal deportation barriers include protection for internally displaced persons or asylum-seekers or protection from threats to immigrants ' lives , such as torture , should they face it in their home countries , " marx said .
" on the other hand , there are the rules governing the situation here : such as when an immigrant is sick or pregnant , making it inadvisable to deport that person due to health reasons . " illegal immigrants whose identities are not confirmed or who can not reach their home countries due to disrupted transportation routes , and therefore can not leave the country , are given a temporary stay permit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in berlin-kreuzberg many of the illegal immigrants who come to germany have followed relatives who are now living legally in the country .
the largest group of illegal aliens are turkish people , said ute koch of an organization called " living illegally . " " there are children and older people who want to live with their relatives residing in germany , but due to strict regulations illegal immigration is often the only thing left open to them , " she said .
" the possibilities for legal migration are very limited . " lose-lose situatio n once in the country , illegal aliens keep a low profile .
they can not protest if they are paid too little or not at all for their work , as they risk deportation .
employers often take advantage of the dilemma . when ill , illegal immigrants are forced to find a doctor who will treat them anonymously and who expects private payment , which most immigrants can not afford .
they therefore often wait until it is almost too late to receive proper treatment . that was the case with frida .
she had stomach pains for a long time and just took pain killers .
she collapsed one day in the city ; an ambulance took her to the hospital .
doctors discovered that she had gall stones .
she left the hospital after two days , for which she had to pay 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- , and still had not had an operation .
she continued to live with the pain until an aid organization arranged for surgery .
her gall bladder was already perforated ; had she let any more time pass , she would have died . not only had she not been able to pay for the operation - frida also feared police would track her down in the hospital .
though frida has just married and has a legal residence permit , she is still scared to talk .
the years of living illegally have made their mark . public kindergartens and schools are also required to notify police of children or families without proper resident permits .
the result : illegal immigrant children do not receive education , and are forced to stay inside out of fear of drawing attention to themselves by not being in school as required for minors . restricti n g illegal immigratio n harms the eco n omy one would think the easiest solution would be to crack down on illegal aliens even more .
but like in the united states , the demand for them is great .
illegal immigrants provide cheap labor and do the work most germans avoid , thomas straubhaar of the hamburg institute of international economics , said . " even if it sounds odd , it 's true that - given the current regulations - germany is dependent on illegal employment of foreign laborers , " straubhaar said . heidi schmidt -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu must change its immigration policy , experts warn rather than building the walls around " fortress europe " higher , as many eu politicians favor , migration experts say the eu needs a new progressive policy on immigration - for its own good .

18 , 2006 -rrb- world bank report says migration highly lucrative immigration is n't just about integration , but also big money .
a new world bank report says migrant workers send billions to their families back home - strengthening local economies as well as helping rich countries .

then , a year ago , it finally put a new immigration law on the books which seems to have achieved very little .

as mourning continues for the late president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , debate about who is best suited to fully integrate germany 's 90,000 jewish migrants from eastern europe has begun . most people involved with the search for a successor understand spiegel was the last council head who consciously lived through the horrors of the holocaust .
whoever will follow in his footsteps is bound to bring with him different views on how to further develop post-war jewish life in germany .
but that 's where the common ground ends . for some prominent members of germany 's jewish community , the outcome of elections for the post of jewish council president , to be held in november , is a foregone conclusion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn decided not to run for the president position in 1999 they believe paul spiegel 's successor can be no other than salomon korn -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 62-year-old jewish architect from frankfurt and one of spiegel 's closest friends .
as the council 's vice-president , korn has played an important role in the expansion of jewish communities across germany . too early to make a decisio n but it 's still much too early to draw any conclusions , according to leading jewish figure micha brumlik .
he said he feels it is inappropriate to focus on a specific name so shortly after spiegel 's death last sunday and would rather concentrate on the abilities the next president should have . " i think we should have somebody at the helm of the council who was born after the second world war , " he said .
" we need someone who has thoroughly analyzed germany 's post-war efforts to come to terms with its history , and its endeavors to build up a new relationship with us jews . " though the german jewish community 's time of remembrance is not over , integration is the newest challenge that needs to be tackled , brumlick added . bo n di n g germa n y 's jewish commu n ities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was paul spiegel the last head to come from germany 's old jewish community ?
while it has been possible to unite some liberal jewish currents under the umbrella of the central council , the integration of the tens of thousands of eastern european jewish migrants is still in its infancy and the council 's next president will need to sort out the ongoing rivalry between jewish migrants and the native german community , according to julius schöps of the felix mendelsohn center in potsdam . " if we look further ahead , we 'll see that there can be no more representatives of the old jewish community in germany following in paul spiegel 's footsteps , " he said .
" we might eventually see someone from the former soviet union taking over as head of the central council .
that would mean a different style of policy . " the council will have to take into account that some 80 percent of members of germany 's regional jewish communities are migrants from the former republics of the soviet union , schöps added . debate will co n ti n ue i n comi n g mo n ths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next council president is unlikely to have consciously experienced the holocaust german jewish lecturer and author guy stern said he believes there will be many more controversial debates about the integration process are far from over .

more and more teens are revisiting a pastime more often associated with their grandparents ' generation : ballroom dancing . if youth has its finger on the pulse of popular culture , then germany 's heart is beating to the rhythms of the rumba , cha-cha , foxtrot and waltz . mia hinrichs is a 15-year-old high school student from cologne whose passions include playing soccer and watching the " the gilmore girls " on television .
last year , when a boy in her class asked her if she would be his partner in a ballroom dancing class , she had to think twice before she agreed . but that was three classes ago , and mia and her friends - their number has since increased - are still going strong .
" i 'll keep it up if my parents allow me to keep going , " hinrichs said .
" i 'd like to get my bronze and silver -lrb- proficiency-level certificates . -rrb- " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drama of ballroom dancing was shown in baz luhrmann 's film " strictly ballroom " a ballroom dancing class was once an unavoidable rite of passage for middle- and upper-class german teens ; a necessary tool for getting by at social events like formal work functions and weddings .
but those classes began to fall out of favor in the 1980s and 90s . hip trend recently , hamburg dance teacher jan giesel told stern magazine that the " low point was 1996 … that 's when nothing was less cool that couples ' dancing . "
many dance schools did n't survive those decades ; those that did banked on hip hop and aerobics classes . now , however , ballroom is back .
the association of german dance schools -lrb- adtv -rrb- reports a 10 percent increase in overall attendance in dance schools across the country from 2004 to 2005 , and association spokeswoman antje kurz said she expects similar growth this year . " i used to think ballroom dance was old fashioned , but i guess it has become hip , " said thomas eck , a 15-year-old cologne high school student who has been studying ballroom dance along with hinrichs at cologne 's tanzschule breuer for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the film " mad hot ballroom , " inner city kids learned ballroom dancing " at first there were only six of us .
now there are at least 30 kids from my school who go , from different grades , " eck said .
" it 's become popular - it 's not just the total outsiders who take ballroom dance . " the power of reality shows the new popularity of standard dance goes hand in hand with a sudden , widespread presence of ballroom on the big and small screens .
recent movies have had titles like " strictly ballroom , " " shall we dance , " and " mad hot ballroom . "
the latter is a documentary on a social program for underprivileged new york school children , which successfully uses ballroom dance to teach life skills . and since early april , germany has been under the thrall of a reality television show called " let 's dance . "
based on britain 's outrageously popular " strictly come dancing " and its equally beloved american spawn " dancing with the stars , " " let 's dance " pairs b-list celebrities with professional ballroom dancers .
the semi-famous couples then compete , showing off their foxtrots , paso dobles , and rumbas for a professional jury and for viewers at home , who then call in to vote pairs off the show until a winner remains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more teens are taking dance courses in this hamburg school " let 's dance " regularly achieves audience ratings of around 20 percent ; the numbers are higher among 19 to 39 year olds , according to german marketing group quotameter . adtv 's kurz said another reason young people are increasingly drawn to dance class is that the schools themselves have changed .
gone are the dusty institutions that could count on teaching entire classes of preteens preparing for their first formal dance .
today 's schools have updated their music repertoires and added diverse array of activities , offering everything from videoclip dance to same-sex ballroom classes for gay couples . " the schools saw they had to do more to keep their clients .
now they are more like clubs .
they throw parties , have youth nights and workshops , or they 'll take a group out to a musical , " kurz said . etiquette and grace other observers say the trend is tied to a renewed interest in old-fashioned values like polish and politesse .
kids today long for security and constraints , they say .
and ballroom dance - with its evocation of supper-club class - fits the clean-fun bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , jennifer lopez starred in " shall we dance ? "
the adtv has even started a " no-disgrace " program , which calls on its members to go beyond teaching dance steps and enter the world of etiquette education .
they see dance schools as the perfect place for kids to learn how to present themselves in the wider world .
" good etiquette is cool , and keeps you from getting stressed out , " an ad on the adtv web site says . hans georg steinig , who runs the breuer dance school in cologne , agrees .
" my students are being prepared for life .
they will be ready for a job interview .
they learn how to present themselves , " he said . for steinig , teaching dance " is all about social competence .
they have to change partners , and everyone is accepted , tolerated , not judged .
each class ends with a round of applause ; and the kids have to look in each others ' eyes . " " i teach the kids that they are not coming here to learn how to look good on the dance floor , " steinig said . " they are dancing for themselves and for their partner .
learning the steps is the best way to feel the music . " fifteen-year-old eck agrees .
" at the beginning it was a little boring , just to learn the steps .
but then you notice you get better , and it feels differrent when you really learn to move to the music .

" i 'd like to get my bronze and silver -lrb- proficiency-level certificates . -rrb- " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drama of ballroom dancing was shown in baz luhrmann 's film " strictly ballroom " a ballroom dancing class was once an unavoidable rite of passage for middle- and upper-class german teens ; a necessary tool for getting by at social events like formal work functions and weddings .
but those classes began to fall out of favor in the 1980s and 90s . hip trend recently , hamburg dance teacher jan giesel told stern magazine that the " low point was 1996 … that 's when nothing was less cool that couples ' dancing . "
many dance schools did n't survive those decades ; those that did banked on hip hop and aerobics classes . now , however , ballroom is back .
the association of german dance schools -lrb- adtv -rrb- reports a 10 percent increase in overall attendance in dance schools across the country from 2004 to 2005 , and association spokeswoman antje kurz said she expects similar growth this year . " i used to think ballroom dance was old fashioned , but i guess it has become hip , " said thomas eck , a 15-year-old cologne high school student who has been studying ballroom dance along with hinrichs at cologne 's tanzschule breuer for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the film " mad hot ballroom , " inner city kids learned ballroom dancing " at first there were only six of us .
now there are at least 30 kids from my school who go , from different grades , " eck said .
" it 's become popular - it 's not just the total outsiders who take ballroom dance . " the power of reality shows the new popularity of standard dance goes hand in hand with a sudden , widespread presence of ballroom on the big and small screens .
recent movies have had titles like " strictly ballroom , " " shall we dance , " and " mad hot ballroom . "
the latter is a documentary on a social program for underprivileged new york school children , which successfully uses ballroom dance to teach life skills . and since early april , germany has been under the thrall of a reality television show called " let 's dance . "
based on britain 's outrageously popular " strictly come dancing " and its equally beloved american spawn " dancing with the stars , " " let 's dance " pairs b-list celebrities with professional ballroom dancers .
the semi-famous couples then compete , showing off their foxtrots , paso dobles , and rumbas for a professional jury and for viewers at home , who then call in to vote pairs off the show until a winner remains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more teens are taking dance courses in this hamburg school " let 's dance " regularly achieves audience ratings of around 20 percent ; the numbers are higher among 19 to 39 year olds , according to german marketing group quotameter . adtv 's kurz said another reason young people are increasingly drawn to dance class is that the schools themselves have changed .
gone are the dusty institutions that could count on teaching entire classes of preteens preparing for their first formal dance .
today 's schools have updated their music repertoires and added diverse array of activities , offering everything from videoclip dance to same-sex ballroom classes for gay couples . " the schools saw they had to do more to keep their clients .
now they are more like clubs .
they throw parties , have youth nights and workshops , or they 'll take a group out to a musical , " kurz said . etiquette and grace other observers say the trend is tied to a renewed interest in old-fashioned values like polish and politesse .
kids today long for security and constraints , they say .
and ballroom dance - with its evocation of supper-club class - fits the clean-fun bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , jennifer lopez starred in " shall we dance ? "
the adtv has even started a " no-disgrace " program , which calls on its members to go beyond teaching dance steps and enter the world of etiquette education .
they see dance schools as the perfect place for kids to learn how to present themselves in the wider world .
" good etiquette is cool , and keeps you from getting stressed out , " an ad on the adtv web site says . hans georg steinig , who runs the breuer dance school in cologne , agrees .
" my students are being prepared for life .
they will be ready for a job interview .
they learn how to present themselves , " he said . for steinig , teaching dance " is all about social competence .
they have to change partners , and everyone is accepted , tolerated , not judged .
each class ends with a round of applause ; and the kids have to look in each others ' eyes . " " i teach the kids that they are not coming here to learn how to look good on the dance floor , " steinig said . " they are dancing for themselves and for their partner .
learning the steps is the best way to feel the music . " fifteen-year-old eck agrees .
" at the beginning it was a little boring , just to learn the steps .
but then you notice you get better , and it feels differrent when you really learn to move to the music .

more and more teens are revisiting a pastime more often associated with their grandparents ' generation : ballroom dancing . if youth has its finger on the pulse of popular culture , then germany 's heart is beating to the rhythms of the rumba , cha-cha , foxtrot and waltz . mia hinrichs is a 15-year-old high school student from cologne whose passions include playing soccer and watching the " the gilmore girls " on television .

most of them start off with a tourist visa and end up hiding out here illegally .
according to estimates by aid organizations , around one million foreigners live in german without proper resident permits or visas .
they are reluctant to speak about their often catastrophic situation for fear of being deported . frida is one example .
she 's african and , five years ago , was living in slave-like conditions in her home country : she was not permitted to leave the house and had no money of her own .
she fled and came to germany to stay with her aunt .
once here , she met her now fiancé - it was love at first sight . that is still the only way illegal immigrants can gain citizenship here - to marry a german .
another option - for women - is to have a child with a german man . illegal immigra n ts face deportatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german office for migration and refugees if they do not have proper papers , illegal immigrants will be deported since they are committing a criminal offense by staying in the country .
only so-called " deportation barriers " can protract them , said reinhard marx , an immigration lawyer . " legal deportation barriers include protection for internally displaced persons or asylum-seekers or protection from threats to immigrants ' lives , such as torture , should they face it in their home countries , " marx said .
" on the other hand , there are the rules governing the situation here : such as when an immigrant is sick or pregnant , making it inadvisable to deport that person due to health reasons . " illegal immigrants whose identities are not confirmed or who can not reach their home countries due to disrupted transportation routes , and therefore can not leave the country , are given a temporary stay permit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in berlin-kreuzberg many of the illegal immigrants who come to germany have followed relatives who are now living legally in the country .
the largest group of illegal aliens are turkish people , said ute koch of an organization called " living illegally . " " there are children and older people who want to live with their relatives residing in germany , but due to strict regulations illegal immigration is often the only thing left open to them , " she said .
" the possibilities for legal migration are very limited . " lose-lose situatio n once in the country , illegal aliens keep a low profile .
they can not protest if they are paid too little or not at all for their work , as they risk deportation .
employers often take advantage of the dilemma . when ill , illegal immigrants are forced to find a doctor who will treat them anonymously and who expects private payment , which most immigrants can not afford .
they therefore often wait until it is almost too late to receive proper treatment . that was the case with frida .
she had stomach pains for a long time and just took pain killers .
she collapsed one day in the city ; an ambulance took her to the hospital .
doctors discovered that she had gall stones .
she left the hospital after two days , for which she had to pay 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- , and still had not had an operation .
she continued to live with the pain until an aid organization arranged for surgery .
her gall bladder was already perforated ; had she let any more time pass , she would have died . not only had she not been able to pay for the operation - frida also feared police would track her down in the hospital .
though frida has just married and has a legal residence permit , she is still scared to talk .
the years of living illegally have made their mark . public kindergartens and schools are also required to notify police of children or families without proper resident permits .
the result : illegal immigrant children do not receive education , and are forced to stay inside out of fear of drawing attention to themselves by not being in school as required for minors . restricti n g illegal immigratio n harms the eco n omy one would think the easiest solution would be to crack down on illegal aliens even more .
but like in the united states , the demand for them is great .
illegal immigrants provide cheap labor and do the work most germans avoid , thomas straubhaar of the hamburg institute of international economics , said . " even if it sounds odd , it 's true that - given the current regulations - germany is dependent on illegal employment of foreign laborers , " straubhaar said . heidi schmidt -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu must change its immigration policy , experts warn rather than building the walls around " fortress europe " higher , as many eu politicians favor , migration experts say the eu needs a new progressive policy on immigration - for its own good .

18 , 2006 -rrb- world bank report says migration highly lucrative immigration is n't just about integration , but also big money .
a new world bank report says migrant workers send billions to their families back home - strengthening local economies as well as helping rich countries .

only so-called " deportation barriers " can protract them , said reinhard marx , an immigration lawyer . " legal deportation barriers include protection for internally displaced persons or asylum-seekers or protection from threats to immigrants ' lives , such as torture , should they face it in their home countries , " marx said .
" on the other hand , there are the rules governing the situation here : such as when an immigrant is sick or pregnant , making it inadvisable to deport that person due to health reasons . " illegal immigrants whose identities are not confirmed or who can not reach their home countries due to disrupted transportation routes , and therefore can not leave the country , are given a temporary stay permit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in berlin-kreuzberg many of the illegal immigrants who come to germany have followed relatives who are now living legally in the country .
the largest group of illegal aliens are turkish people , said ute koch of an organization called " living illegally .

she had stomach pains for a long time and just took pain killers .
she collapsed one day in the city ; an ambulance took her to the hospital .
doctors discovered that she had gall stones .
she left the hospital after two days , for which she had to pay 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- , and still had not had an operation .
she continued to live with the pain until an aid organization arranged for surgery .
her gall bladder was already perforated ; had she let any more time pass , she would have died . not only had she not been able to pay for the operation - frida also feared police would track her down in the hospital .
though frida has just married and has a legal residence permit , she is still scared to talk .
the years of living illegally have made their mark . public kindergartens and schools are also required to notify police of children or families without proper resident permits .
the result : illegal immigrant children do not receive education , and are forced to stay inside out of fear of drawing attention to themselves by not being in school as required for minors . restricti n g illegal immigratio n harms the eco n omy one would think the easiest solution would be to crack down on illegal aliens even more .

after five hours of discussions , leaders have reached compromises over a wealth tax and parental subsidies , but not health care . kurt beck , the designated leader of the social democratic party , was clearly buoyant after lengthy discussions over key reforms in the german chancellery . " we have come along very nicely and are on the way with all the important issues we wanted to tackle , " beck said .
" as you can see , i 'm very happy . " introducing reforms was seen as a key test for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government .
for weeks the social democrats and christian democrats - who form the coalition - have argued over the reforms .
now it seems they have finally come to agreement , at least over some important issues .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said on tuesday that coalition partners " want a joint success . " wealth taxes a n d aid for n ew pare n ts a " wealth tax " is to be introduced , by which high earners will be obliged to pay more in taxes .
as of january next year individuals with an annual income of 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 316,000 -rrb- or more will have to pay 45 percent income tax - that is an increase of 3 percent . the new system will exclude small businesses , a move pushed for by the conservatives .
markus söder , the secretary general of the bavarian csu party , which is also in the coalition government , said negotiators were keen to avoid burdening small businesses any further . the new tax is expected to free up more than a billion euros for state coffers - money chancellor angela merkel desperately needs to finance yet more costly reforms . if the mo n ey 's right , me n wa n t to raise childre n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents have to juggle work and family the coalition also came to an agreement over benefits for parents who want to take time off from work to look after their newborn babies .
the coalition partners agreed on a 12-month scheme , with an option for another two months if the father also takes paternity leave .
during this time , parents will then receive up to 67 percent of their last net earnings per month , but no more than 1,800 euros . every second man in germany says he would take time off work to raise children , if he had the financial means to do so .
both christian democrats and social democrats were keen to improve the situation for parents , in order to boost germany ’ s low birth rate . " we have agreed on a fundamental change of family policy , " pofalla said . " we do n't expect the costs of the measure to go beyond the calculated 3.8 billion euros , but we are convinced it will become a success , leading to higher birth rates . " the reform plan was spear-headed by family minister ursula von der leyen , who is now hoping to encourage the huge number of working , childless couples in germany to have more babies . the fdp a n d gree n s are dubious but on the streets , people do not appear to see extra money as an incentive to have children .

" asked dirk niebel , the secretary general of the free-market liberal free democratic party , the largest opposition party .
green party parliamentary leader renate künast meanwhile warned that the coalition agreement on parental aid included a " bag of conjuror 's tricks " that would end up costing tax-payers more . the reforms were key elements in the coalition government 's plan to reform taxes , state benefits and the health service .

after five hours of discussions , leaders have reached compromises over a wealth tax and parental subsidies , but not health care . kurt beck , the designated leader of the social democratic party , was clearly buoyant after lengthy discussions over key reforms in the german chancellery . " we have come along very nicely and are on the way with all the important issues we wanted to tackle , " beck said .
" as you can see , i 'm very happy . " introducing reforms was seen as a key test for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government .
for weeks the social democrats and christian democrats - who form the coalition - have argued over the reforms .
now it seems they have finally come to agreement , at least over some important issues .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said on tuesday that coalition partners " want a joint success . " wealth taxes a n d aid for n ew pare n ts a " wealth tax " is to be introduced , by which high earners will be obliged to pay more in taxes .
as of january next year individuals with an annual income of 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 316,000 -rrb- or more will have to pay 45 percent income tax - that is an increase of 3 percent . the new system will exclude small businesses , a move pushed for by the conservatives .
markus söder , the secretary general of the bavarian csu party , which is also in the coalition government , said negotiators were keen to avoid burdening small businesses any further . the new tax is expected to free up more than a billion euros for state coffers - money chancellor angela merkel desperately needs to finance yet more costly reforms . if the mo n ey 's right , me n wa n t to raise childre n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents have to juggle work and family the coalition also came to an agreement over benefits for parents who want to take time off from work to look after their newborn babies .
the coalition partners agreed on a 12-month scheme , with an option for another two months if the father also takes paternity leave .
during this time , parents will then receive up to 67 percent of their last net earnings per month , but no more than 1,800 euros . every second man in germany says he would take time off work to raise children , if he had the financial means to do so .
both christian democrats and social democrats were keen to improve the situation for parents , in order to boost germany ’ s low birth rate . " we have agreed on a fundamental change of family policy , " pofalla said . " we do n't expect the costs of the measure to go beyond the calculated 3.8 billion euros , but we are convinced it will become a success , leading to higher birth rates . " the reform plan was spear-headed by family minister ursula von der leyen , who is now hoping to encourage the huge number of working , childless couples in germany to have more babies . the fdp a n d gree n s are dubious but on the streets , people do not appear to see extra money as an incentive to have children .
one man said : " that would n't be a reason for me to father a child . "
a woman said : " if i want to have a baby , i 'll think about it carefully .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green party parliamentary leader renate künast the opposition in government - the free market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - are equally skeptical about the new scheme for parents .
they believe that economic aid is not enough and that the child care system in germany must be improved . " what good does parental aid do when after 12 or 14 months there 's no child care ? " asked dirk niebel , the secretary general of the free-market liberal free democratic party , the largest opposition party .
green party parliamentary leader renate künast meanwhile warned that the coalition agreement on parental aid included a " bag of conjuror 's tricks " that would end up costing tax-payers more . the reforms were key elements in the coalition government 's plan to reform taxes , state benefits and the health service .

as mourning continues for the late president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , debate about who is best suited to fully integrate germany 's 90,000 jewish migrants from eastern europe has begun . most people involved with the search for a successor understand spiegel was the last council head who consciously lived through the horrors of the holocaust .
whoever will follow in his footsteps is bound to bring with him different views on how to further develop post-war jewish life in germany .
but that 's where the common ground ends . for some prominent members of germany 's jewish community , the outcome of elections for the post of jewish council president , to be held in november , is a foregone conclusion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn decided not to run for the president position in 1999 they believe paul spiegel 's successor can be no other than salomon korn -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 62-year-old jewish architect from frankfurt and one of spiegel 's closest friends .
as the council 's vice-president , korn has played an important role in the expansion of jewish communities across germany . too early to make a decisio n but it 's still much too early to draw any conclusions , according to leading jewish figure micha brumlik .
he said he feels it is inappropriate to focus on a specific name so shortly after spiegel 's death last sunday and would rather concentrate on the abilities the next president should have . " i think we should have somebody at the helm of the council who was born after the second world war , " he said .
" we need someone who has thoroughly analyzed germany 's post-war efforts to come to terms with its history , and its endeavors to build up a new relationship with us jews .

while it has been possible to unite some liberal jewish currents under the umbrella of the central council , the integration of the tens of thousands of eastern european jewish migrants is still in its infancy and the council 's next president will need to sort out the ongoing rivalry between jewish migrants and the native german community , according to julius schöps of the felix mendelsohn center in potsdam .

governments consciously hinder the media 's work by passing laws that restrict the press , fostering an atmosphere of intimidation and fear , harassing and imprisoning journalists or even killing them . the media , however , continue to play a crucial role in strengthening democratic principles and promoting the development of civil society .
recognizing the media as a force of change , the un observes world press freedom day on may 3 every year . dw-world 's coverage of recent events in germany and europe - ranging from the raid on the offices of a political magazine in the german town of potsdam to the international protests following the publication of mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper - shows that freedom of the press remains of utmost importance for the functioning of western democracies .
but it also highlights how the free media can turn into a point of contention in intercultural relations . dw-world.de is freedom of the press dying out in germany ?

" the two hostages were taken in three suvs this morning to the airport , " a security guard at the embassy told afp .
officials at the embassy declined to comment . rene bräeunlich , 32 , and thomas nitzschke , 28 , were freed tuesday after being held for more than three months in captivity . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , in the midst of a state visit to chile , said he had spoken to the men , thomas nitzschke and rene bräunlich , and that they were well , considering the circumstances , the german news agency dpa reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the hostages are free , thank god , " reads the sign held by leipzig 's mayor , burkhard jung " i am happy to tell you that the two kidnapped leipzigers , thomas nitzschke and rene bräunlich , are , as of today , free again , " steinmeier said from santiago de chile .
" after more than three months of inhumane conditions , they are now safely in german hands in iraq and will , according to the current plans , return to germany tomorrow . "
" i am very relieved and happy that the german hostages in iraq have been freed , " chancellor angela merkel said of the men 's release . so far , it appears that the men were let go as a result of negotiations with the hostage-takers .
the german foreign ministry had established a task force devoted to the release of the hostages shortly after they were kidnapped .
it was not clear whether ransom money had been paid .
in a press conference on tuesday evening , task force member reinhard silberberg thanked those who had contributed to the men being let go .
he said that , as in the past , the government would not comment on the circumstances of their release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier continually called for calm during the hostage ordeal nitzschke , 28 , and bräunlich , 32 , were kidnapped in northern iraq while working for the german engineering firm cryotec .

in the last video , which appeared on the internet on april 9 , nitzschke spoke , calling for help .
" we ca n't stand it much longer , " he said .
the men had been threatened with execution .
their captors , a group called ansar al-tawheed wal sunna -lrb- followers of unity and prophetic tradition -rrb- , demanded the release of all iraqis held in us-run prisons and told germany to stop giving help to the us and iraqi authorities there . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig keeps candles burning for german hostages hundreds gathered in leipzig on monday to show their solidarity with the two german engineers still being held hostage in iraq .

after five hours of discussions , leaders have reached compromises over a wealth tax and parental subsidies , but not health care . kurt beck , the designated leader of the social democratic party , was clearly buoyant after lengthy discussions over key reforms in the german chancellery . " we have come along very nicely and are on the way with all the important issues we wanted to tackle , " beck said .
" as you can see , i 'm very happy . " introducing reforms was seen as a key test for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government .
for weeks the social democrats and christian democrats - who form the coalition - have argued over the reforms .
now it seems they have finally come to agreement , at least over some important issues .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said on tuesday that coalition partners " want a joint success . " wealth taxes a n d aid for n ew pare n ts a " wealth tax " is to be introduced , by which high earners will be obliged to pay more in taxes .
as of january next year individuals with an annual income of 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 316,000 -rrb- or more will have to pay 45 percent income tax - that is an increase of 3 percent . the new system will exclude small businesses , a move pushed for by the conservatives .
markus söder , the secretary general of the bavarian csu party , which is also in the coalition government , said negotiators were keen to avoid burdening small businesses any further . the new tax is expected to free up more than a billion euros for state coffers - money chancellor angela merkel desperately needs to finance yet more costly reforms . if the mo n ey 's right , me n wa n t to raise childre n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents have to juggle work and family the coalition also came to an agreement over benefits for parents who want to take time off from work to look after their newborn babies .
the coalition partners agreed on a 12-month scheme , with an option for another two months if the father also takes paternity leave .
during this time , parents will then receive up to 67 percent of their last net earnings per month , but no more than 1,800 euros . every second man in germany says he would take time off work to raise children , if he had the financial means to do so .
both christian democrats and social democrats were keen to improve the situation for parents , in order to boost germany ’ s low birth rate . " we have agreed on a fundamental change of family policy , " pofalla said . " we do n't expect the costs of the measure to go beyond the calculated 3.8 billion euros , but we are convinced it will become a success , leading to higher birth rates . " the reform plan was spear-headed by family minister ursula von der leyen , who is now hoping to encourage the huge number of working , childless couples in germany to have more babies . the fdp a n d gree n s are dubious but on the streets , people do not appear to see extra money as an incentive to have children .
one man said : " that would n't be a reason for me to father a child . "
a woman said : " if i want to have a baby , i 'll think about it carefully .
more money wo n't influence my decision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green party parliamentary leader renate künast the opposition in government - the free market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - are equally skeptical about the new scheme for parents .
they believe that economic aid is not enough and that the child care system in germany must be improved . " what good does parental aid do when after 12 or 14 months there 's no child care ? " asked dirk niebel , the secretary general of the free-market liberal free democratic party , the largest opposition party .
green party parliamentary leader renate künast meanwhile warned that the coalition agreement on parental aid included a " bag of conjuror 's tricks " that would end up costing tax-payers more . the reforms were key elements in the coalition government 's plan to reform taxes , state benefits and the health service .
but an overhaul of the health system is one area where angela merkel 's government must still make progress . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days the dire predictions once made about germany 's current " grand coalition " government have proven untrue .

after five hours of discussions , leaders have reached compromises over a wealth tax and parental subsidies , but not health care . kurt beck , the designated leader of the social democratic party , was clearly buoyant after lengthy discussions over key reforms in the german chancellery . " we have come along very nicely and are on the way with all the important issues we wanted to tackle , " beck said .
" as you can see , i 'm very happy . " introducing reforms was seen as a key test for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government .
for weeks the social democrats and christian democrats - who form the coalition - have argued over the reforms .
now it seems they have finally come to agreement , at least over some important issues .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said on tuesday that coalition partners " want a joint success . " wealth taxes a n d aid for n ew pare n ts a " wealth tax " is to be introduced , by which high earners will be obliged to pay more in taxes .
as of january next year individuals with an annual income of 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 316,000 -rrb- or more will have to pay 45 percent income tax - that is an increase of 3 percent . the new system will exclude small businesses , a move pushed for by the conservatives .
markus söder , the secretary general of the bavarian csu party , which is also in the coalition government , said negotiators were keen to avoid burdening small businesses any further . the new tax is expected to free up more than a billion euros for state coffers - money chancellor angela merkel desperately needs to finance yet more costly reforms . if the mo n ey 's right , me n wa n t to raise childre n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents have to juggle work and family the coalition also came to an agreement over benefits for parents who want to take time off from work to look after their newborn babies .
the coalition partners agreed on a 12-month scheme , with an option for another two months if the father also takes paternity leave .
during this time , parents will then receive up to 67 percent of their last net earnings per month , but no more than 1,800 euros . every second man in germany says he would take time off work to raise children , if he had the financial means to do so .
both christian democrats and social democrats were keen to improve the situation for parents , in order to boost germany ’ s low birth rate . " we have agreed on a fundamental change of family policy , " pofalla said . " we do n't expect the costs of the measure to go beyond the calculated 3.8 billion euros , but we are convinced it will become a success , leading to higher birth rates . " the reform plan was spear-headed by family minister ursula von der leyen , who is now hoping to encourage the huge number of working , childless couples in germany to have more babies . the fdp a n d gree n s are dubious but on the streets , people do not appear to see extra money as an incentive to have children .
one man said : " that would n't be a reason for me to father a child . "
a woman said : " if i want to have a baby , i 'll think about it carefully .
more money wo n't influence my decision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green party parliamentary leader renate künast the opposition in government - the free market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - are equally skeptical about the new scheme for parents .
they believe that economic aid is not enough and that the child care system in germany must be improved . " what good does parental aid do when after 12 or 14 months there 's no child care ? " asked dirk niebel , the secretary general of the free-market liberal free democratic party , the largest opposition party .
green party parliamentary leader renate künast meanwhile warned that the coalition agreement on parental aid included a " bag of conjuror 's tricks " that would end up costing tax-payers more . the reforms were key elements in the coalition government 's plan to reform taxes , state benefits and the health service .
but an overhaul of the health system is one area where angela merkel 's government must still make progress . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days the dire predictions once made about germany 's current " grand coalition " government have proven untrue .

" this will certainly make investors think twice before they start building economic relations in the direction of bolivia , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bolivian president evo morales fulfilled his election campaign promises bolivian top military commanders announced the seizure of 56 oil and gas fields moments after president evo morales formally decreed nationalization of the country 's oil and gas operations , which had been expected . " the state is recovering its property , the possession and total and absolute control of these resources , " morales said at a may day speech at san alberto gas field in southern bolivia . morales called on the country 's " patriots " to " mobilize against any effort by any company to sabotage " the nationalization .
bolivia has the second-largest gas reserves in south america . a frie n dly tour during his tour of latin america , which will include trips to chile , argentina and brazil , steinmeier is expected to discuss political and trade relations after a number of countries in the region have elected left-leaning governments in recent years . according to germany 's foreign ministry , steinmeier 's visits to chile , argentina and brazil are intended to foster this country 's strategic partnership with latin america . foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger played on the world cup motto - a time to make friends - to sum up the overall theme . " if one were to create a specific motto for these visits , then it could well be ' being hosted by friends , " ' jäger said . successive german government and business leaders have , indeed , been eager to maintain close relations with countries in the region even in difficult times of dictatorship and economic degradation . a star eco n omy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tthe first woman to be elected president in chile : michelle bachelet in chile - steimeier 's first stop on tuesday - the german foreign minister will meet with newly-elected president michelle bachelet .
the head of the center-left coalition -lrb- and chile 's first woman president -rrb- spent many years in former communist east germany where she found political asylum during the military dictatorship of augustus pinochet in the 1970s . the german foreign minister will pay tribute to the victims of the military coup by visiting the infamous " villa grimaldi " prison where thousands of chileans were tortured and disappeared . today democratic chile has become latin america 's star economy with annual growth rates of more than 6 percent .
according to claudia zilla , a latin america expert at the berlin-based science and policy research foundation , the country 's economic development coupled with a stable government is hugely attractive for foreign investors . " chile has achieved continuity in its political process , which is based on consensus within society as a whole , " zilla said .
" chileans have been able to create stable political conditions because people there have reached fundamental agreement on common political and economic goals . " getti n g the house i n order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentinian president nestor kirchner in argentina , president nestor kirchner is only just beginning to get his country in order after a disastrous collapse of the economy and state finances five years ago .
in his talks with steinmeier and the german business leaders accompanying him , he will try to convince them that argentina is again a safe place to invest in . " it 's important to remember that not a single german company deserted argentina during this huge crisis , " said barbara konner , who is the latin america spokeswomen of the german chambers of commerce and industry .
" this shows that these companies are still full of hope and confident that the economy there will soon pick up steam again . " i n ter n atio n al ambitio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian president lula da silva in brazil , the german foreign minister 's talks with president lula da silva will also focus on bilateral trade as well as the two countries ' efforts to play a more prominent role in the united nations . germany and brazil have teamed up with india and japan in a bid to become permanent members of the united nations ' security council . but steinmeier 's visit to the country may also be welcome by the leftist brazilian president as he is seeking to shore up his political fortunes ahead of october 's presidential election . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de last chance talks for g4 un hopefuls diplomats from germany , india , japan , brazil and the african union meet in london on monday to thrash out what could be their last chance at agreeing a common strategy for expanding the un security council by september .

" the state is recovering its property , the possession and total and absolute control of these resources , " morales said at a may day speech at san alberto gas field in southern bolivia . morales called on the country 's " patriots " to " mobilize against any effort by any company to sabotage " the nationalization .
bolivia has the second-largest gas reserves in south america . a frie n dly tour during his tour of latin america , which will include trips to chile , argentina and brazil , steinmeier is expected to discuss political and trade relations after a number of countries in the region have elected left-leaning governments in recent years . according to germany 's foreign ministry , steinmeier 's visits to chile , argentina and brazil are intended to foster this country 's strategic partnership with latin america . foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger played on the world cup motto - a time to make friends - to sum up the overall theme . " if one were to create a specific motto for these visits , then it could well be ' being hosted by friends , " ' jäger said . successive german government and business leaders have , indeed , been eager to maintain close relations with countries in the region even in difficult times of dictatorship and economic degradation . a star eco n omy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tthe first woman to be elected president in chile : michelle bachelet in chile - steimeier 's first stop on tuesday - the german foreign minister will meet with newly-elected president michelle bachelet .

according to claudia zilla , a latin america expert at the berlin-based science and policy research foundation , the country 's economic development coupled with a stable government is hugely attractive for foreign investors . " chile has achieved continuity in its political process , which is based on consensus within society as a whole , " zilla said .
" chileans have been able to create stable political conditions because people there have reached fundamental agreement on common political and economic goals .

in his talks with steinmeier and the german business leaders accompanying him , he will try to convince them that argentina is again a safe place to invest in . " it 's important to remember that not a single german company deserted argentina during this huge crisis , " said barbara konner , who is the latin america spokeswomen of the german chambers of commerce and industry .
" this shows that these companies are still full of hope and confident that the economy there will soon pick up steam again .

she fled and came to germany to stay with her aunt .

only so-called " deportation barriers " can protract them , said reinhard marx , an immigration lawyer . " legal deportation barriers include protection for internally displaced persons or asylum-seekers or protection from threats to immigrants ' lives , such as torture , should they face it in their home countries , " marx said .
" on the other hand , there are the rules governing the situation here : such as when an immigrant is sick or pregnant , making it inadvisable to deport that person due to health reasons .

doctors discovered that she had gall stones .
she left the hospital after two days , for which she had to pay 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- , and still had not had an operation .
she continued to live with the pain until an aid organization arranged for surgery .
her gall bladder was already perforated ; had she let any more time pass , she would have died . not only had she not been able to pay for the operation - frida also feared police would track her down in the hospital .

the years of living illegally have made their mark . public kindergartens and schools are also required to notify police of children or families without proper resident permits .

after five hours of discussions , leaders have reached compromises over a wealth tax and parental subsidies , but not health care . kurt beck , the designated leader of the social democratic party , was clearly buoyant after lengthy discussions over key reforms in the german chancellery . " we have come along very nicely and are on the way with all the important issues we wanted to tackle , " beck said .
" as you can see , i 'm very happy . " introducing reforms was seen as a key test for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government .
for weeks the social democrats and christian democrats - who form the coalition - have argued over the reforms .
now it seems they have finally come to agreement , at least over some important issues .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said on tuesday that coalition partners " want a joint success . " wealth taxes a n d aid for n ew pare n ts a " wealth tax " is to be introduced , by which high earners will be obliged to pay more in taxes .
as of january next year individuals with an annual income of 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 316,000 -rrb- or more will have to pay 45 percent income tax - that is an increase of 3 percent . the new system will exclude small businesses , a move pushed for by the conservatives .
markus söder , the secretary general of the bavarian csu party , which is also in the coalition government , said negotiators were keen to avoid burdening small businesses any further . the new tax is expected to free up more than a billion euros for state coffers - money chancellor angela merkel desperately needs to finance yet more costly reforms . if the mo n ey 's right , me n wa n t to raise childre n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents have to juggle work and family the coalition also came to an agreement over benefits for parents who want to take time off from work to look after their newborn babies .
the coalition partners agreed on a 12-month scheme , with an option for another two months if the father also takes paternity leave .
during this time , parents will then receive up to 67 percent of their last net earnings per month , but no more than 1,800 euros . every second man in germany says he would take time off work to raise children , if he had the financial means to do so .
both christian democrats and social democrats were keen to improve the situation for parents , in order to boost germany ’ s low birth rate . " we have agreed on a fundamental change of family policy , " pofalla said . " we do n't expect the costs of the measure to go beyond the calculated 3.8 billion euros , but we are convinced it will become a success , leading to higher birth rates . " the reform plan was spear-headed by family minister ursula von der leyen , who is now hoping to encourage the huge number of working , childless couples in germany to have more babies . the fdp a n d gree n s are dubious but on the streets , people do not appear to see extra money as an incentive to have children .
one man said : " that would n't be a reason for me to father a child . "
a woman said : " if i want to have a baby , i 'll think about it carefully .

after five hours of discussions , leaders have reached compromises over a wealth tax and parental subsidies , but not health care . kurt beck , the designated leader of the social democratic party , was clearly buoyant after lengthy discussions over key reforms in the german chancellery .

" as you can see , i 'm very happy . " introducing reforms was seen as a key test for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government .
for weeks the social democrats and christian democrats - who form the coalition - have argued over the reforms .
now it seems they have finally come to agreement , at least over some important issues .

markus söder , the secretary general of the bavarian csu party , which is also in the coalition government , said negotiators were keen to avoid burdening small businesses any further . the new tax is expected to free up more than a billion euros for state coffers - money chancellor angela merkel desperately needs to finance yet more costly reforms . if the mo n ey 's right , me n wa n t to raise childre n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents have to juggle work and family the coalition also came to an agreement over benefits for parents who want to take time off from work to look after their newborn babies .

both christian democrats and social democrats were keen to improve the situation for parents , in order to boost germany ’ s low birth rate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.05.2006 ballroom dancing is mad hot trend among german teens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teens are learning social competence along with dance steps , according to one teacher for increasing numbers of german teenagers , partying no longer means long nights at the disco .
more and more teens are revisiting a pastime more often associated with their grandparents ' generation : ballroom dancing . if youth has its finger on the pulse of popular culture , then germany 's heart is beating to the rhythms of the rumba , cha-cha , foxtrot and waltz . mia hinrichs is a 15-year-old high school student from cologne whose passions include playing soccer and watching the " the gilmore girls " on television .
last year , when a boy in her class asked her if she would be his partner in a ballroom dancing class , she had to think twice before she agreed . but that was three classes ago , and mia and her friends - their number has since increased - are still going strong .
" i 'll keep it up if my parents allow me to keep going , " hinrichs said .
" i 'd like to get my bronze and silver -lrb- proficiency-level certificates . -rrb- " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drama of ballroom dancing was shown in baz luhrmann 's film " strictly ballroom " a ballroom dancing class was once an unavoidable rite of passage for middle- and upper-class german teens ; a necessary tool for getting by at social events like formal work functions and weddings .
but those classes began to fall out of favor in the 1980s and 90s . hip trend recently , hamburg dance teacher jan giesel told stern magazine that the " low point was 1996 … that 's when nothing was less cool that couples ' dancing . "
many dance schools did n't survive those decades ; those that did banked on hip hop and aerobics classes . now , however , ballroom is back .
the association of german dance schools -lrb- adtv -rrb- reports a 10 percent increase in overall attendance in dance schools across the country from 2004 to 2005 , and association spokeswoman antje kurz said she expects similar growth this year . " i used to think ballroom dance was old fashioned , but i guess it has become hip , " said thomas eck , a 15-year-old cologne high school student who has been studying ballroom dance along with hinrichs at cologne 's tanzschule breuer for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the film " mad hot ballroom , " inner city kids learned ballroom dancing " at first there were only six of us .
now there are at least 30 kids from my school who go , from different grades , " eck said .
" it 's become popular - it 's not just the total outsiders who take ballroom dance . " the power of reality shows the new popularity of standard dance goes hand in hand with a sudden , widespread presence of ballroom on the big and small screens .
recent movies have had titles like " strictly ballroom , " " shall we dance , " and " mad hot ballroom . "
the latter is a documentary on a social program for underprivileged new york school children , which successfully uses ballroom dance to teach life skills . and since early april , germany has been under the thrall of a reality television show called " let 's dance . "
based on britain 's outrageously popular " strictly come dancing " and its equally beloved american spawn " dancing with the stars , " " let 's dance " pairs b-list celebrities with professional ballroom dancers .
the semi-famous couples then compete , showing off their foxtrots , paso dobles , and rumbas for a professional jury and for viewers at home , who then call in to vote pairs off the show until a winner remains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more teens are taking dance courses in this hamburg school " let 's dance " regularly achieves audience ratings of around 20 percent ; the numbers are higher among 19 to 39 year olds , according to german marketing group quotameter . adtv 's kurz said another reason young people are increasingly drawn to dance class is that the schools themselves have changed .
gone are the dusty institutions that could count on teaching entire classes of preteens preparing for their first formal dance .
today 's schools have updated their music repertoires and added diverse array of activities , offering everything from videoclip dance to same-sex ballroom classes for gay couples . " the schools saw they had to do more to keep their clients .
now they are more like clubs .
they throw parties , have youth nights and workshops , or they 'll take a group out to a musical , " kurz said . etiquette and grace other observers say the trend is tied to a renewed interest in old-fashioned values like polish and politesse .
kids today long for security and constraints , they say .
and ballroom dance - with its evocation of supper-club class - fits the clean-fun bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , jennifer lopez starred in " shall we dance ? "
the adtv has even started a " no-disgrace " program , which calls on its members to go beyond teaching dance steps and enter the world of etiquette education .
they see dance schools as the perfect place for kids to learn how to present themselves in the wider world .
" good etiquette is cool , and keeps you from getting stressed out , " an ad on the adtv web site says . hans georg steinig , who runs the breuer dance school in cologne , agrees .
" my students are being prepared for life .
they will be ready for a job interview .
they learn how to present themselves , " he said . for steinig , teaching dance " is all about social competence .
they have to change partners , and everyone is accepted , tolerated , not judged .
each class ends with a round of applause ; and the kids have to look in each others ' eyes . " " i teach the kids that they are not coming here to learn how to look good on the dance floor , " steinig said . " they are dancing for themselves and for their partner .
learning the steps is the best way to feel the music . " fifteen-year-old eck agrees .

more and more teens are revisiting a pastime more often associated with their grandparents ' generation : ballroom dancing . if youth has its finger on the pulse of popular culture , then germany 's heart is beating to the rhythms of the rumba , cha-cha , foxtrot and waltz . mia hinrichs is a 15-year-old high school student from cologne whose passions include playing soccer and watching the " the gilmore girls " on television .
last year , when a boy in her class asked her if she would be his partner in a ballroom dancing class , she had to think twice before she agreed . but that was three classes ago , and mia and her friends - their number has since increased - are still going strong .
" i 'll keep it up if my parents allow me to keep going , " hinrichs said .
" i 'd like to get my bronze and silver -lrb- proficiency-level certificates . -rrb- " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drama of ballroom dancing was shown in baz luhrmann 's film " strictly ballroom " a ballroom dancing class was once an unavoidable rite of passage for middle- and upper-class german teens ; a necessary tool for getting by at social events like formal work functions and weddings .
but those classes began to fall out of favor in the 1980s and 90s . hip trend recently , hamburg dance teacher jan giesel told stern magazine that the " low point was 1996 … that 's when nothing was less cool that couples ' dancing . "
many dance schools did n't survive those decades ; those that did banked on hip hop and aerobics classes . now , however , ballroom is back .
the association of german dance schools -lrb- adtv -rrb- reports a 10 percent increase in overall attendance in dance schools across the country from 2004 to 2005 , and association spokeswoman antje kurz said she expects similar growth this year . " i used to think ballroom dance was old fashioned , but i guess it has become hip , " said thomas eck , a 15-year-old cologne high school student who has been studying ballroom dance along with hinrichs at cologne 's tanzschule breuer for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the film " mad hot ballroom , " inner city kids learned ballroom dancing " at first there were only six of us .
now there are at least 30 kids from my school who go , from different grades , " eck said .
" it 's become popular - it 's not just the total outsiders who take ballroom dance . " the power of reality shows the new popularity of standard dance goes hand in hand with a sudden , widespread presence of ballroom on the big and small screens .
recent movies have had titles like " strictly ballroom , " " shall we dance , " and " mad hot ballroom . "
the latter is a documentary on a social program for underprivileged new york school children , which successfully uses ballroom dance to teach life skills . and since early april , germany has been under the thrall of a reality television show called " let 's dance . "
based on britain 's outrageously popular " strictly come dancing " and its equally beloved american spawn " dancing with the stars , " " let 's dance " pairs b-list celebrities with professional ballroom dancers .
the semi-famous couples then compete , showing off their foxtrots , paso dobles , and rumbas for a professional jury and for viewers at home , who then call in to vote pairs off the show until a winner remains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more teens are taking dance courses in this hamburg school " let 's dance " regularly achieves audience ratings of around 20 percent ; the numbers are higher among 19 to 39 year olds , according to german marketing group quotameter . adtv 's kurz said another reason young people are increasingly drawn to dance class is that the schools themselves have changed .
gone are the dusty institutions that could count on teaching entire classes of preteens preparing for their first formal dance .
today 's schools have updated their music repertoires and added diverse array of activities , offering everything from videoclip dance to same-sex ballroom classes for gay couples . " the schools saw they had to do more to keep their clients .
now they are more like clubs .
they throw parties , have youth nights and workshops , or they 'll take a group out to a musical , " kurz said . etiquette and grace other observers say the trend is tied to a renewed interest in old-fashioned values like polish and politesse .
kids today long for security and constraints , they say .
and ballroom dance - with its evocation of supper-club class - fits the clean-fun bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , jennifer lopez starred in " shall we dance ? "
the adtv has even started a " no-disgrace " program , which calls on its members to go beyond teaching dance steps and enter the world of etiquette education .
they see dance schools as the perfect place for kids to learn how to present themselves in the wider world .
" good etiquette is cool , and keeps you from getting stressed out , " an ad on the adtv web site says . hans georg steinig , who runs the breuer dance school in cologne , agrees .
" my students are being prepared for life .
they will be ready for a job interview .
they learn how to present themselves , " he said . for steinig , teaching dance " is all about social competence .

each class ends with a round of applause ; and the kids have to look in each others ' eyes . " " i teach the kids that they are not coming here to learn how to look good on the dance floor , " steinig said . " they are dancing for themselves and for their partner .
learning the steps is the best way to feel the music . " fifteen-year-old eck agrees .

" i 'd like to get my bronze and silver -lrb- proficiency-level certificates . -rrb- " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drama of ballroom dancing was shown in baz luhrmann 's film " strictly ballroom " a ballroom dancing class was once an unavoidable rite of passage for middle- and upper-class german teens ; a necessary tool for getting by at social events like formal work functions and weddings .
but those classes began to fall out of favor in the 1980s and 90s . hip trend recently , hamburg dance teacher jan giesel told stern magazine that the " low point was 1996 … that 's when nothing was less cool that couples ' dancing . "
many dance schools did n't survive those decades ; those that did banked on hip hop and aerobics classes . now , however , ballroom is back .
the association of german dance schools -lrb- adtv -rrb- reports a 10 percent increase in overall attendance in dance schools across the country from 2004 to 2005 , and association spokeswoman antje kurz said she expects similar growth this year . " i used to think ballroom dance was old fashioned , but i guess it has become hip , " said thomas eck , a 15-year-old cologne high school student who has been studying ballroom dance along with hinrichs at cologne 's tanzschule breuer for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the film " mad hot ballroom , " inner city kids learned ballroom dancing " at first there were only six of us .
now there are at least 30 kids from my school who go , from different grades , " eck said .
" it 's become popular - it 's not just the total outsiders who take ballroom dance . " the power of reality shows the new popularity of standard dance goes hand in hand with a sudden , widespread presence of ballroom on the big and small screens .
recent movies have had titles like " strictly ballroom , " " shall we dance , " and " mad hot ballroom . "
the latter is a documentary on a social program for underprivileged new york school children , which successfully uses ballroom dance to teach life skills . and since early april , germany has been under the thrall of a reality television show called " let 's dance . "
based on britain 's outrageously popular " strictly come dancing " and its equally beloved american spawn " dancing with the stars , " " let 's dance " pairs b-list celebrities with professional ballroom dancers .
the semi-famous couples then compete , showing off their foxtrots , paso dobles , and rumbas for a professional jury and for viewers at home , who then call in to vote pairs off the show until a winner remains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more teens are taking dance courses in this hamburg school " let 's dance " regularly achieves audience ratings of around 20 percent ; the numbers are higher among 19 to 39 year olds , according to german marketing group quotameter . adtv 's kurz said another reason young people are increasingly drawn to dance class is that the schools themselves have changed .
gone are the dusty institutions that could count on teaching entire classes of preteens preparing for their first formal dance .
today 's schools have updated their music repertoires and added diverse array of activities , offering everything from videoclip dance to same-sex ballroom classes for gay couples . " the schools saw they had to do more to keep their clients .
now they are more like clubs .
they throw parties , have youth nights and workshops , or they 'll take a group out to a musical , " kurz said . etiquette and grace other observers say the trend is tied to a renewed interest in old-fashioned values like polish and politesse .
kids today long for security and constraints , they say .
and ballroom dance - with its evocation of supper-club class - fits the clean-fun bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , jennifer lopez starred in " shall we dance ? "
the adtv has even started a " no-disgrace " program , which calls on its members to go beyond teaching dance steps and enter the world of etiquette education .
they see dance schools as the perfect place for kids to learn how to present themselves in the wider world .
" good etiquette is cool , and keeps you from getting stressed out , " an ad on the adtv web site says . hans georg steinig , who runs the breuer dance school in cologne , agrees .
" my students are being prepared for life .
they will be ready for a job interview .
they learn how to present themselves , " he said . for steinig , teaching dance " is all about social competence .
they have to change partners , and everyone is accepted , tolerated , not judged .
each class ends with a round of applause ; and the kids have to look in each others ' eyes . " " i teach the kids that they are not coming here to learn how to look good on the dance floor , " steinig said . " they are dancing for themselves and for their partner .
learning the steps is the best way to feel the music . " fifteen-year-old eck agrees .
" at the beginning it was a little boring , just to learn the steps .

more and more teens are revisiting a pastime more often associated with their grandparents ' generation : ballroom dancing . if youth has its finger on the pulse of popular culture , then germany 's heart is beating to the rhythms of the rumba , cha-cha , foxtrot and waltz . mia hinrichs is a 15-year-old high school student from cologne whose passions include playing soccer and watching the " the gilmore girls " on television .

after five hours of discussions , leaders have reached compromises over a wealth tax and parental subsidies , but not health care . kurt beck , the designated leader of the social democratic party , was clearly buoyant after lengthy discussions over key reforms in the german chancellery . " we have come along very nicely and are on the way with all the important issues we wanted to tackle , " beck said .
" as you can see , i 'm very happy . " introducing reforms was seen as a key test for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government .
for weeks the social democrats and christian democrats - who form the coalition - have argued over the reforms .
now it seems they have finally come to agreement , at least over some important issues .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said on tuesday that coalition partners " want a joint success . " wealth taxes a n d aid for n ew pare n ts a " wealth tax " is to be introduced , by which high earners will be obliged to pay more in taxes .
as of january next year individuals with an annual income of 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 316,000 -rrb- or more will have to pay 45 percent income tax - that is an increase of 3 percent . the new system will exclude small businesses , a move pushed for by the conservatives .
markus söder , the secretary general of the bavarian csu party , which is also in the coalition government , said negotiators were keen to avoid burdening small businesses any further . the new tax is expected to free up more than a billion euros for state coffers - money chancellor angela merkel desperately needs to finance yet more costly reforms . if the mo n ey 's right , me n wa n t to raise childre n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents have to juggle work and family the coalition also came to an agreement over benefits for parents who want to take time off from work to look after their newborn babies .
the coalition partners agreed on a 12-month scheme , with an option for another two months if the father also takes paternity leave .
during this time , parents will then receive up to 67 percent of their last net earnings per month , but no more than 1,800 euros . every second man in germany says he would take time off work to raise children , if he had the financial means to do so .
both christian democrats and social democrats were keen to improve the situation for parents , in order to boost germany ’ s low birth rate . " we have agreed on a fundamental change of family policy , " pofalla said . " we do n't expect the costs of the measure to go beyond the calculated 3.8 billion euros , but we are convinced it will become a success , leading to higher birth rates . " the reform plan was spear-headed by family minister ursula von der leyen , who is now hoping to encourage the huge number of working , childless couples in germany to have more babies . the fdp a n d gree n s are dubious but on the streets , people do not appear to see extra money as an incentive to have children .
one man said : " that would n't be a reason for me to father a child . "

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green party parliamentary leader renate künast the opposition in government - the free market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - are equally skeptical about the new scheme for parents .
they believe that economic aid is not enough and that the child care system in germany must be improved . " what good does parental aid do when after 12 or 14 months there 's no child care ? " asked dirk niebel , the secretary general of the free-market liberal free democratic party , the largest opposition party .
green party parliamentary leader renate künast meanwhile warned that the coalition agreement on parental aid included a " bag of conjuror 's tricks " that would end up costing tax-payers more . the reforms were key elements in the coalition government 's plan to reform taxes , state benefits and the health service .

after five hours of discussions , leaders have reached compromises over a wealth tax and parental subsidies , but not health care . kurt beck , the designated leader of the social democratic party , was clearly buoyant after lengthy discussions over key reforms in the german chancellery . " we have come along very nicely and are on the way with all the important issues we wanted to tackle , " beck said .
" as you can see , i 'm very happy . " introducing reforms was seen as a key test for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government .
for weeks the social democrats and christian democrats - who form the coalition - have argued over the reforms .
now it seems they have finally come to agreement , at least over some important issues .

markus söder , the secretary general of the bavarian csu party , which is also in the coalition government , said negotiators were keen to avoid burdening small businesses any further . the new tax is expected to free up more than a billion euros for state coffers - money chancellor angela merkel desperately needs to finance yet more costly reforms . if the mo n ey 's right , me n wa n t to raise childre n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents have to juggle work and family the coalition also came to an agreement over benefits for parents who want to take time off from work to look after their newborn babies .
the coalition partners agreed on a 12-month scheme , with an option for another two months if the father also takes paternity leave .
during this time , parents will then receive up to 67 percent of their last net earnings per month , but no more than 1,800 euros . every second man in germany says he would take time off work to raise children , if he had the financial means to do so .
both christian democrats and social democrats were keen to improve the situation for parents , in order to boost germany ’ s low birth rate . " we have agreed on a fundamental change of family policy , " pofalla said . " we do n't expect the costs of the measure to go beyond the calculated 3.8 billion euros , but we are convinced it will become a success , leading to higher birth rates . " the reform plan was spear-headed by family minister ursula von der leyen , who is now hoping to encourage the huge number of working , childless couples in germany to have more babies . the fdp a n d gree n s are dubious but on the streets , people do not appear to see extra money as an incentive to have children .

as mourning continues for the late president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , debate about who is best suited to fully integrate germany 's 90,000 jewish migrants from eastern europe has begun . most people involved with the search for a successor understand spiegel was the last council head who consciously lived through the horrors of the holocaust .
whoever will follow in his footsteps is bound to bring with him different views on how to further develop post-war jewish life in germany .
but that 's where the common ground ends . for some prominent members of germany 's jewish community , the outcome of elections for the post of jewish council president , to be held in november , is a foregone conclusion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn decided not to run for the president position in 1999 they believe paul spiegel 's successor can be no other than salomon korn -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 62-year-old jewish architect from frankfurt and one of spiegel 's closest friends .
as the council 's vice-president , korn has played an important role in the expansion of jewish communities across germany . too early to make a decisio n but it 's still much too early to draw any conclusions , according to leading jewish figure micha brumlik .
he said he feels it is inappropriate to focus on a specific name so shortly after spiegel 's death last sunday and would rather concentrate on the abilities the next president should have . " i think we should have somebody at the helm of the council who was born after the second world war , " he said .
" we need someone who has thoroughly analyzed germany 's post-war efforts to come to terms with its history , and its endeavors to build up a new relationship with us jews . " though the german jewish community 's time of remembrance is not over , integration is the newest challenge that needs to be tackled , brumlick added . bo n di n g germa n y 's jewish commu n ities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was paul spiegel the last head to come from germany 's old jewish community ?
while it has been possible to unite some liberal jewish currents under the umbrella of the central council , the integration of the tens of thousands of eastern european jewish migrants is still in its infancy and the council 's next president will need to sort out the ongoing rivalry between jewish migrants and the native german community , according to julius schöps of the felix mendelsohn center in potsdam . " if we look further ahead , we 'll see that there can be no more representatives of the old jewish community in germany following in paul spiegel 's footsteps , " he said .
" we might eventually see someone from the former soviet union taking over as head of the central council .
that would mean a different style of policy . " the council will have to take into account that some 80 percent of members of germany 's regional jewish communities are migrants from the former republics of the soviet union , schöps added . debate will co n ti n ue i n comi n g mo n ths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next council president is unlikely to have consciously experienced the holocaust german jewish lecturer and author guy stern said he believes there will be many more controversial debates about the integration process are far from over . " there are many obstacles to a reintegration of immigrant jews , " he said , saying the jewish groups from the former soviet union range from having orthodox to cynical views of religion .

more and more teens are revisiting a pastime more often associated with their grandparents ' generation : ballroom dancing . if youth has its finger on the pulse of popular culture , then germany 's heart is beating to the rhythms of the rumba , cha-cha , foxtrot and waltz . mia hinrichs is a 15-year-old high school student from cologne whose passions include playing soccer and watching the " the gilmore girls " on television .
last year , when a boy in her class asked her if she would be his partner in a ballroom dancing class , she had to think twice before she agreed . but that was three classes ago , and mia and her friends - their number has since increased - are still going strong .
" i 'll keep it up if my parents allow me to keep going , " hinrichs said .
" i 'd like to get my bronze and silver -lrb- proficiency-level certificates . -rrb- " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drama of ballroom dancing was shown in baz luhrmann 's film " strictly ballroom " a ballroom dancing class was once an unavoidable rite of passage for middle- and upper-class german teens ; a necessary tool for getting by at social events like formal work functions and weddings .
but those classes began to fall out of favor in the 1980s and 90s . hip trend recently , hamburg dance teacher jan giesel told stern magazine that the " low point was 1996 … that 's when nothing was less cool that couples ' dancing . "
many dance schools did n't survive those decades ; those that did banked on hip hop and aerobics classes . now , however , ballroom is back .
the association of german dance schools -lrb- adtv -rrb- reports a 10 percent increase in overall attendance in dance schools across the country from 2004 to 2005 , and association spokeswoman antje kurz said she expects similar growth this year . " i used to think ballroom dance was old fashioned , but i guess it has become hip , " said thomas eck , a 15-year-old cologne high school student who has been studying ballroom dance along with hinrichs at cologne 's tanzschule breuer for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the film " mad hot ballroom , " inner city kids learned ballroom dancing " at first there were only six of us .
now there are at least 30 kids from my school who go , from different grades , " eck said .
" it 's become popular - it 's not just the total outsiders who take ballroom dance . " the power of reality shows the new popularity of standard dance goes hand in hand with a sudden , widespread presence of ballroom on the big and small screens .
recent movies have had titles like " strictly ballroom , " " shall we dance , " and " mad hot ballroom . "
the latter is a documentary on a social program for underprivileged new york school children , which successfully uses ballroom dance to teach life skills . and since early april , germany has been under the thrall of a reality television show called " let 's dance . "
based on britain 's outrageously popular " strictly come dancing " and its equally beloved american spawn " dancing with the stars , " " let 's dance " pairs b-list celebrities with professional ballroom dancers .
the semi-famous couples then compete , showing off their foxtrots , paso dobles , and rumbas for a professional jury and for viewers at home , who then call in to vote pairs off the show until a winner remains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more teens are taking dance courses in this hamburg school " let 's dance " regularly achieves audience ratings of around 20 percent ; the numbers are higher among 19 to 39 year olds , according to german marketing group quotameter . adtv 's kurz said another reason young people are increasingly drawn to dance class is that the schools themselves have changed .
gone are the dusty institutions that could count on teaching entire classes of preteens preparing for their first formal dance .
today 's schools have updated their music repertoires and added diverse array of activities , offering everything from videoclip dance to same-sex ballroom classes for gay couples . " the schools saw they had to do more to keep their clients .
now they are more like clubs .
they throw parties , have youth nights and workshops , or they 'll take a group out to a musical , " kurz said . etiquette and grace other observers say the trend is tied to a renewed interest in old-fashioned values like polish and politesse .
kids today long for security and constraints , they say .
and ballroom dance - with its evocation of supper-club class - fits the clean-fun bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , jennifer lopez starred in " shall we dance ? "
the adtv has even started a " no-disgrace " program , which calls on its members to go beyond teaching dance steps and enter the world of etiquette education .
they see dance schools as the perfect place for kids to learn how to present themselves in the wider world .
" good etiquette is cool , and keeps you from getting stressed out , " an ad on the adtv web site says . hans georg steinig , who runs the breuer dance school in cologne , agrees .
" my students are being prepared for life .
they will be ready for a job interview .
they learn how to present themselves , " he said . for steinig , teaching dance " is all about social competence .
they have to change partners , and everyone is accepted , tolerated , not judged .
each class ends with a round of applause ; and the kids have to look in each others ' eyes . " " i teach the kids that they are not coming here to learn how to look good on the dance floor , " steinig said . " they are dancing for themselves and for their partner .
learning the steps is the best way to feel the music . " fifteen-year-old eck agrees .
" at the beginning it was a little boring , just to learn the steps .

more and more teens are revisiting a pastime more often associated with their grandparents ' generation : ballroom dancing . if youth has its finger on the pulse of popular culture , then germany 's heart is beating to the rhythms of the rumba , cha-cha , foxtrot and waltz . mia hinrichs is a 15-year-old high school student from cologne whose passions include playing soccer and watching the " the gilmore girls " on television .
last year , when a boy in her class asked her if she would be his partner in a ballroom dancing class , she had to think twice before she agreed . but that was three classes ago , and mia and her friends - their number has since increased - are still going strong .
" i 'll keep it up if my parents allow me to keep going , " hinrichs said .
" i 'd like to get my bronze and silver -lrb- proficiency-level certificates . -rrb- " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drama of ballroom dancing was shown in baz luhrmann 's film " strictly ballroom " a ballroom dancing class was once an unavoidable rite of passage for middle- and upper-class german teens ; a necessary tool for getting by at social events like formal work functions and weddings .
but those classes began to fall out of favor in the 1980s and 90s . hip trend recently , hamburg dance teacher jan giesel told stern magazine that the " low point was 1996 … that 's when nothing was less cool that couples ' dancing . "
many dance schools did n't survive those decades ; those that did banked on hip hop and aerobics classes . now , however , ballroom is back .
the association of german dance schools -lrb- adtv -rrb- reports a 10 percent increase in overall attendance in dance schools across the country from 2004 to 2005 , and association spokeswoman antje kurz said she expects similar growth this year . " i used to think ballroom dance was old fashioned , but i guess it has become hip , " said thomas eck , a 15-year-old cologne high school student who has been studying ballroom dance along with hinrichs at cologne 's tanzschule breuer for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the film " mad hot ballroom , " inner city kids learned ballroom dancing " at first there were only six of us .
now there are at least 30 kids from my school who go , from different grades , " eck said .
" it 's become popular - it 's not just the total outsiders who take ballroom dance . " the power of reality shows the new popularity of standard dance goes hand in hand with a sudden , widespread presence of ballroom on the big and small screens .
recent movies have had titles like " strictly ballroom , " " shall we dance , " and " mad hot ballroom . "
the latter is a documentary on a social program for underprivileged new york school children , which successfully uses ballroom dance to teach life skills . and since early april , germany has been under the thrall of a reality television show called " let 's dance . "
based on britain 's outrageously popular " strictly come dancing " and its equally beloved american spawn " dancing with the stars , " " let 's dance " pairs b-list celebrities with professional ballroom dancers .
the semi-famous couples then compete , showing off their foxtrots , paso dobles , and rumbas for a professional jury and for viewers at home , who then call in to vote pairs off the show until a winner remains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more teens are taking dance courses in this hamburg school " let 's dance " regularly achieves audience ratings of around 20 percent ; the numbers are higher among 19 to 39 year olds , according to german marketing group quotameter . adtv 's kurz said another reason young people are increasingly drawn to dance class is that the schools themselves have changed .
gone are the dusty institutions that could count on teaching entire classes of preteens preparing for their first formal dance .
today 's schools have updated their music repertoires and added diverse array of activities , offering everything from videoclip dance to same-sex ballroom classes for gay couples . " the schools saw they had to do more to keep their clients .
now they are more like clubs .
they throw parties , have youth nights and workshops , or they 'll take a group out to a musical , " kurz said . etiquette and grace other observers say the trend is tied to a renewed interest in old-fashioned values like polish and politesse .
kids today long for security and constraints , they say .
and ballroom dance - with its evocation of supper-club class - fits the clean-fun bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , jennifer lopez starred in " shall we dance ? "
the adtv has even started a " no-disgrace " program , which calls on its members to go beyond teaching dance steps and enter the world of etiquette education .
they see dance schools as the perfect place for kids to learn how to present themselves in the wider world .
" good etiquette is cool , and keeps you from getting stressed out , " an ad on the adtv web site says . hans georg steinig , who runs the breuer dance school in cologne , agrees .
" my students are being prepared for life .
they will be ready for a job interview .
they learn how to present themselves , " he said . for steinig , teaching dance " is all about social competence .
they have to change partners , and everyone is accepted , tolerated , not judged .
each class ends with a round of applause ; and the kids have to look in each others ' eyes . " " i teach the kids that they are not coming here to learn how to look good on the dance floor , " steinig said . " they are dancing for themselves and for their partner .
learning the steps is the best way to feel the music . " fifteen-year-old eck agrees .
" at the beginning it was a little boring , just to learn the steps .
but then you notice you get better , and it feels differrent when you really learn to move to the music .

most of them start off with a tourist visa and end up hiding out here illegally .
according to estimates by aid organizations , around one million foreigners live in german without proper resident permits or visas .
they are reluctant to speak about their often catastrophic situation for fear of being deported . frida is one example .
she 's african and , five years ago , was living in slave-like conditions in her home country : she was not permitted to leave the house and had no money of her own .
she fled and came to germany to stay with her aunt .
once here , she met her now fiancé - it was love at first sight . that is still the only way illegal immigrants can gain citizenship here - to marry a german .
another option - for women - is to have a child with a german man . illegal immigra n ts face deportatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german office for migration and refugees if they do not have proper papers , illegal immigrants will be deported since they are committing a criminal offense by staying in the country .
only so-called " deportation barriers " can protract them , said reinhard marx , an immigration lawyer . " legal deportation barriers include protection for internally displaced persons or asylum-seekers or protection from threats to immigrants ' lives , such as torture , should they face it in their home countries , " marx said .
" on the other hand , there are the rules governing the situation here : such as when an immigrant is sick or pregnant , making it inadvisable to deport that person due to health reasons . " illegal immigrants whose identities are not confirmed or who can not reach their home countries due to disrupted transportation routes , and therefore can not leave the country , are given a temporary stay permit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in berlin-kreuzberg many of the illegal immigrants who come to germany have followed relatives who are now living legally in the country .
the largest group of illegal aliens are turkish people , said ute koch of an organization called " living illegally . " " there are children and older people who want to live with their relatives residing in germany , but due to strict regulations illegal immigration is often the only thing left open to them , " she said .
" the possibilities for legal migration are very limited . " lose-lose situatio n once in the country , illegal aliens keep a low profile .
they can not protest if they are paid too little or not at all for their work , as they risk deportation .
employers often take advantage of the dilemma . when ill , illegal immigrants are forced to find a doctor who will treat them anonymously and who expects private payment , which most immigrants can not afford .
they therefore often wait until it is almost too late to receive proper treatment . that was the case with frida .
she had stomach pains for a long time and just took pain killers .
she collapsed one day in the city ; an ambulance took her to the hospital .
doctors discovered that she had gall stones .
she left the hospital after two days , for which she had to pay 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- , and still had not had an operation .
she continued to live with the pain until an aid organization arranged for surgery .
her gall bladder was already perforated ; had she let any more time pass , she would have died . not only had she not been able to pay for the operation - frida also feared police would track her down in the hospital .
though frida has just married and has a legal residence permit , she is still scared to talk .
the years of living illegally have made their mark . public kindergartens and schools are also required to notify police of children or families without proper resident permits .
the result : illegal immigrant children do not receive education , and are forced to stay inside out of fear of drawing attention to themselves by not being in school as required for minors . restricti n g illegal immigratio n harms the eco n omy one would think the easiest solution would be to crack down on illegal aliens even more .
but like in the united states , the demand for them is great .
illegal immigrants provide cheap labor and do the work most germans avoid , thomas straubhaar of the hamburg institute of international economics , said . " even if it sounds odd , it 's true that - given the current regulations - germany is dependent on illegal employment of foreign laborers , " straubhaar said . heidi schmidt -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu must change its immigration policy , experts warn rather than building the walls around " fortress europe " higher , as many eu politicians favor , migration experts say the eu needs a new progressive policy on immigration - for its own good .

she left the hospital after two days , for which she had to pay 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- , and still had not had an operation .
she continued to live with the pain until an aid organization arranged for surgery .
her gall bladder was already perforated ; had she let any more time pass , she would have died . not only had she not been able to pay for the operation - frida also feared police would track her down in the hospital .

the years of living illegally have made their mark . public kindergartens and schools are also required to notify police of children or families without proper resident permits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.05.2006 ballroom dancing is mad hot trend among german teens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teens are learning social competence along with dance steps , according to one teacher for increasing numbers of german teenagers , partying no longer means long nights at the disco .
more and more teens are revisiting a pastime more often associated with their grandparents ' generation : ballroom dancing . if youth has its finger on the pulse of popular culture , then germany 's heart is beating to the rhythms of the rumba , cha-cha , foxtrot and waltz . mia hinrichs is a 15-year-old high school student from cologne whose passions include playing soccer and watching the " the gilmore girls " on television .
last year , when a boy in her class asked her if she would be his partner in a ballroom dancing class , she had to think twice before she agreed . but that was three classes ago , and mia and her friends - their number has since increased - are still going strong .
" i 'll keep it up if my parents allow me to keep going , " hinrichs said .
" i 'd like to get my bronze and silver -lrb- proficiency-level certificates . -rrb- " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drama of ballroom dancing was shown in baz luhrmann 's film " strictly ballroom " a ballroom dancing class was once an unavoidable rite of passage for middle- and upper-class german teens ; a necessary tool for getting by at social events like formal work functions and weddings .
but those classes began to fall out of favor in the 1980s and 90s . hip trend recently , hamburg dance teacher jan giesel told stern magazine that the " low point was 1996 … that 's when nothing was less cool that couples ' dancing . "
many dance schools did n't survive those decades ; those that did banked on hip hop and aerobics classes . now , however , ballroom is back .
the association of german dance schools -lrb- adtv -rrb- reports a 10 percent increase in overall attendance in dance schools across the country from 2004 to 2005 , and association spokeswoman antje kurz said she expects similar growth this year . " i used to think ballroom dance was old fashioned , but i guess it has become hip , " said thomas eck , a 15-year-old cologne high school student who has been studying ballroom dance along with hinrichs at cologne 's tanzschule breuer for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the film " mad hot ballroom , " inner city kids learned ballroom dancing " at first there were only six of us .
now there are at least 30 kids from my school who go , from different grades , " eck said .
" it 's become popular - it 's not just the total outsiders who take ballroom dance . " the power of reality shows the new popularity of standard dance goes hand in hand with a sudden , widespread presence of ballroom on the big and small screens .
recent movies have had titles like " strictly ballroom , " " shall we dance , " and " mad hot ballroom . "
the latter is a documentary on a social program for underprivileged new york school children , which successfully uses ballroom dance to teach life skills . and since early april , germany has been under the thrall of a reality television show called " let 's dance . "
based on britain 's outrageously popular " strictly come dancing " and its equally beloved american spawn " dancing with the stars , " " let 's dance " pairs b-list celebrities with professional ballroom dancers .
the semi-famous couples then compete , showing off their foxtrots , paso dobles , and rumbas for a professional jury and for viewers at home , who then call in to vote pairs off the show until a winner remains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more teens are taking dance courses in this hamburg school " let 's dance " regularly achieves audience ratings of around 20 percent ; the numbers are higher among 19 to 39 year olds , according to german marketing group quotameter . adtv 's kurz said another reason young people are increasingly drawn to dance class is that the schools themselves have changed .
gone are the dusty institutions that could count on teaching entire classes of preteens preparing for their first formal dance .
today 's schools have updated their music repertoires and added diverse array of activities , offering everything from videoclip dance to same-sex ballroom classes for gay couples . " the schools saw they had to do more to keep their clients .
now they are more like clubs .

more and more teens are revisiting a pastime more often associated with their grandparents ' generation : ballroom dancing . if youth has its finger on the pulse of popular culture , then germany 's heart is beating to the rhythms of the rumba , cha-cha , foxtrot and waltz . mia hinrichs is a 15-year-old high school student from cologne whose passions include playing soccer and watching the " the gilmore girls " on television .
last year , when a boy in her class asked her if she would be his partner in a ballroom dancing class , she had to think twice before she agreed . but that was three classes ago , and mia and her friends - their number has since increased - are still going strong .
" i 'll keep it up if my parents allow me to keep going , " hinrichs said .
" i 'd like to get my bronze and silver -lrb- proficiency-level certificates . -rrb- " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drama of ballroom dancing was shown in baz luhrmann 's film " strictly ballroom " a ballroom dancing class was once an unavoidable rite of passage for middle- and upper-class german teens ; a necessary tool for getting by at social events like formal work functions and weddings .
but those classes began to fall out of favor in the 1980s and 90s . hip trend recently , hamburg dance teacher jan giesel told stern magazine that the " low point was 1996 … that 's when nothing was less cool that couples ' dancing . "
many dance schools did n't survive those decades ; those that did banked on hip hop and aerobics classes . now , however , ballroom is back .
the association of german dance schools -lrb- adtv -rrb- reports a 10 percent increase in overall attendance in dance schools across the country from 2004 to 2005 , and association spokeswoman antje kurz said she expects similar growth this year . " i used to think ballroom dance was old fashioned , but i guess it has become hip , " said thomas eck , a 15-year-old cologne high school student who has been studying ballroom dance along with hinrichs at cologne 's tanzschule breuer for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the film " mad hot ballroom , " inner city kids learned ballroom dancing " at first there were only six of us .
now there are at least 30 kids from my school who go , from different grades , " eck said .
" it 's become popular - it 's not just the total outsiders who take ballroom dance . " the power of reality shows the new popularity of standard dance goes hand in hand with a sudden , widespread presence of ballroom on the big and small screens .
recent movies have had titles like " strictly ballroom , " " shall we dance , " and " mad hot ballroom . "
the latter is a documentary on a social program for underprivileged new york school children , which successfully uses ballroom dance to teach life skills . and since early april , germany has been under the thrall of a reality television show called " let 's dance . "
based on britain 's outrageously popular " strictly come dancing " and its equally beloved american spawn " dancing with the stars , " " let 's dance " pairs b-list celebrities with professional ballroom dancers .
the semi-famous couples then compete , showing off their foxtrots , paso dobles , and rumbas for a professional jury and for viewers at home , who then call in to vote pairs off the show until a winner remains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more teens are taking dance courses in this hamburg school " let 's dance " regularly achieves audience ratings of around 20 percent ; the numbers are higher among 19 to 39 year olds , according to german marketing group quotameter . adtv 's kurz said another reason young people are increasingly drawn to dance class is that the schools themselves have changed .
gone are the dusty institutions that could count on teaching entire classes of preteens preparing for their first formal dance .
today 's schools have updated their music repertoires and added diverse array of activities , offering everything from videoclip dance to same-sex ballroom classes for gay couples . " the schools saw they had to do more to keep their clients .

more and more teens are revisiting a pastime more often associated with their grandparents ' generation : ballroom dancing . if youth has its finger on the pulse of popular culture , then germany 's heart is beating to the rhythms of the rumba , cha-cha , foxtrot and waltz . mia hinrichs is a 15-year-old high school student from cologne whose passions include playing soccer and watching the " the gilmore girls " on television .
last year , when a boy in her class asked her if she would be his partner in a ballroom dancing class , she had to think twice before she agreed . but that was three classes ago , and mia and her friends - their number has since increased - are still going strong .
" i 'll keep it up if my parents allow me to keep going , " hinrichs said .
" i 'd like to get my bronze and silver -lrb- proficiency-level certificates . -rrb- " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drama of ballroom dancing was shown in baz luhrmann 's film " strictly ballroom " a ballroom dancing class was once an unavoidable rite of passage for middle- and upper-class german teens ; a necessary tool for getting by at social events like formal work functions and weddings .
but those classes began to fall out of favor in the 1980s and 90s . hip trend recently , hamburg dance teacher jan giesel told stern magazine that the " low point was 1996 … that 's when nothing was less cool that couples ' dancing . "
many dance schools did n't survive those decades ; those that did banked on hip hop and aerobics classes . now , however , ballroom is back .
the association of german dance schools -lrb- adtv -rrb- reports a 10 percent increase in overall attendance in dance schools across the country from 2004 to 2005 , and association spokeswoman antje kurz said she expects similar growth this year . " i used to think ballroom dance was old fashioned , but i guess it has become hip , " said thomas eck , a 15-year-old cologne high school student who has been studying ballroom dance along with hinrichs at cologne 's tanzschule breuer for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the film " mad hot ballroom , " inner city kids learned ballroom dancing " at first there were only six of us .
now there are at least 30 kids from my school who go , from different grades , " eck said .
" it 's become popular - it 's not just the total outsiders who take ballroom dance . " the power of reality shows the new popularity of standard dance goes hand in hand with a sudden , widespread presence of ballroom on the big and small screens .
recent movies have had titles like " strictly ballroom , " " shall we dance , " and " mad hot ballroom . "
the latter is a documentary on a social program for underprivileged new york school children , which successfully uses ballroom dance to teach life skills . and since early april , germany has been under the thrall of a reality television show called " let 's dance . "
based on britain 's outrageously popular " strictly come dancing " and its equally beloved american spawn " dancing with the stars , " " let 's dance " pairs b-list celebrities with professional ballroom dancers .
the semi-famous couples then compete , showing off their foxtrots , paso dobles , and rumbas for a professional jury and for viewers at home , who then call in to vote pairs off the show until a winner remains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more teens are taking dance courses in this hamburg school " let 's dance " regularly achieves audience ratings of around 20 percent ; the numbers are higher among 19 to 39 year olds , according to german marketing group quotameter . adtv 's kurz said another reason young people are increasingly drawn to dance class is that the schools themselves have changed .
gone are the dusty institutions that could count on teaching entire classes of preteens preparing for their first formal dance .
today 's schools have updated their music repertoires and added diverse array of activities , offering everything from videoclip dance to same-sex ballroom classes for gay couples . " the schools saw they had to do more to keep their clients .
now they are more like clubs .
they throw parties , have youth nights and workshops , or they 'll take a group out to a musical , " kurz said . etiquette and grace other observers say the trend is tied to a renewed interest in old-fashioned values like polish and politesse .
kids today long for security and constraints , they say .
and ballroom dance - with its evocation of supper-club class - fits the clean-fun bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , jennifer lopez starred in " shall we dance ? "
the adtv has even started a " no-disgrace " program , which calls on its members to go beyond teaching dance steps and enter the world of etiquette education .
they see dance schools as the perfect place for kids to learn how to present themselves in the wider world .
" good etiquette is cool , and keeps you from getting stressed out , " an ad on the adtv web site says . hans georg steinig , who runs the breuer dance school in cologne , agrees .
" my students are being prepared for life .
they will be ready for a job interview .
they learn how to present themselves , " he said . for steinig , teaching dance " is all about social competence .
they have to change partners , and everyone is accepted , tolerated , not judged .
each class ends with a round of applause ; and the kids have to look in each others ' eyes . " " i teach the kids that they are not coming here to learn how to look good on the dance floor , " steinig said . " they are dancing for themselves and for their partner .
learning the steps is the best way to feel the music . " fifteen-year-old eck agrees .
" at the beginning it was a little boring , just to learn the steps .

as mourning continues for the late president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , debate about who is best suited to fully integrate germany 's 90,000 jewish migrants from eastern europe has begun . most people involved with the search for a successor understand spiegel was the last council head who consciously lived through the horrors of the holocaust .
whoever will follow in his footsteps is bound to bring with him different views on how to further develop post-war jewish life in germany .
but that 's where the common ground ends . for some prominent members of germany 's jewish community , the outcome of elections for the post of jewish council president , to be held in november , is a foregone conclusion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn decided not to run for the president position in 1999 they believe paul spiegel 's successor can be no other than salomon korn -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 62-year-old jewish architect from frankfurt and one of spiegel 's closest friends .
as the council 's vice-president , korn has played an important role in the expansion of jewish communities across germany . too early to make a decisio n but it 's still much too early to draw any conclusions , according to leading jewish figure micha brumlik .
he said he feels it is inappropriate to focus on a specific name so shortly after spiegel 's death last sunday and would rather concentrate on the abilities the next president should have . " i think we should have somebody at the helm of the council who was born after the second world war , " he said .
" we need someone who has thoroughly analyzed germany 's post-war efforts to come to terms with its history , and its endeavors to build up a new relationship with us jews . " though the german jewish community 's time of remembrance is not over , integration is the newest challenge that needs to be tackled , brumlick added . bo n di n g germa n y 's jewish commu n ities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was paul spiegel the last head to come from germany 's old jewish community ?
while it has been possible to unite some liberal jewish currents under the umbrella of the central council , the integration of the tens of thousands of eastern european jewish migrants is still in its infancy and the council 's next president will need to sort out the ongoing rivalry between jewish migrants and the native german community , according to julius schöps of the felix mendelsohn center in potsdam . " if we look further ahead , we 'll see that there can be no more representatives of the old jewish community in germany following in paul spiegel 's footsteps , " he said .
" we might eventually see someone from the former soviet union taking over as head of the central council .
that would mean a different style of policy . " the council will have to take into account that some 80 percent of members of germany 's regional jewish communities are migrants from the former republics of the soviet union , schöps added . debate will co n ti n ue i n comi n g mo n ths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next council president is unlikely to have consciously experienced the holocaust german jewish lecturer and author guy stern said he believes there will be many more controversial debates about the integration process are far from over . " there are many obstacles to a reintegration of immigrant jews , " he said , saying the jewish groups from the former soviet union range from having orthodox to cynical views of religion .

as the council 's vice-president , korn has played an important role in the expansion of jewish communities across germany . too early to make a decisio n but it 's still much too early to draw any conclusions , according to leading jewish figure micha brumlik .
he said he feels it is inappropriate to focus on a specific name so shortly after spiegel 's death last sunday and would rather concentrate on the abilities the next president should have . " i think we should have somebody at the helm of the council who was born after the second world war , " he said .

" if we look further ahead , we 'll see that there can be no more representatives of the old jewish community in germany following in paul spiegel 's footsteps , " he said .
" we might eventually see someone from the former soviet union taking over as head of the central council .

after five hours of discussions , leaders have reached compromises over a wealth tax and parental subsidies , but not health care . kurt beck , the designated leader of the social democratic party , was clearly buoyant after lengthy discussions over key reforms in the german chancellery . " we have come along very nicely and are on the way with all the important issues we wanted to tackle , " beck said .
" as you can see , i 'm very happy . " introducing reforms was seen as a key test for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government .
for weeks the social democrats and christian democrats - who form the coalition - have argued over the reforms .
now it seems they have finally come to agreement , at least over some important issues .
cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said on tuesday that coalition partners " want a joint success . " wealth taxes a n d aid for n ew pare n ts a " wealth tax " is to be introduced , by which high earners will be obliged to pay more in taxes .
as of january next year individuals with an annual income of 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 316,000 -rrb- or more will have to pay 45 percent income tax - that is an increase of 3 percent . the new system will exclude small businesses , a move pushed for by the conservatives .
markus söder , the secretary general of the bavarian csu party , which is also in the coalition government , said negotiators were keen to avoid burdening small businesses any further . the new tax is expected to free up more than a billion euros for state coffers - money chancellor angela merkel desperately needs to finance yet more costly reforms . if the mo n ey 's right , me n wa n t to raise childre n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents have to juggle work and family the coalition also came to an agreement over benefits for parents who want to take time off from work to look after their newborn babies .
the coalition partners agreed on a 12-month scheme , with an option for another two months if the father also takes paternity leave .
during this time , parents will then receive up to 67 percent of their last net earnings per month , but no more than 1,800 euros . every second man in germany says he would take time off work to raise children , if he had the financial means to do so .
both christian democrats and social democrats were keen to improve the situation for parents , in order to boost germany ’ s low birth rate . " we have agreed on a fundamental change of family policy , " pofalla said . " we do n't expect the costs of the measure to go beyond the calculated 3.8 billion euros , but we are convinced it will become a success , leading to higher birth rates . " the reform plan was spear-headed by family minister ursula von der leyen , who is now hoping to encourage the huge number of working , childless couples in germany to have more babies . the fdp a n d gree n s are dubious but on the streets , people do not appear to see extra money as an incentive to have children .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green party parliamentary leader renate künast the opposition in government - the free market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the green party - are equally skeptical about the new scheme for parents .

" asked dirk niebel , the secretary general of the free-market liberal free democratic party , the largest opposition party .
green party parliamentary leader renate künast meanwhile warned that the coalition agreement on parental aid included a " bag of conjuror 's tricks " that would end up costing tax-payers more . the reforms were key elements in the coalition government 's plan to reform taxes , state benefits and the health service .

markus söder , the secretary general of the bavarian csu party , which is also in the coalition government , said negotiators were keen to avoid burdening small businesses any further . the new tax is expected to free up more than a billion euros for state coffers - money chancellor angela merkel desperately needs to finance yet more costly reforms . if the mo n ey 's right , me n wa n t to raise childre n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents have to juggle work and family the coalition also came to an agreement over benefits for parents who want to take time off from work to look after their newborn babies .
the coalition partners agreed on a 12-month scheme , with an option for another two months if the father also takes paternity leave .
during this time , parents will then receive up to 67 percent of their last net earnings per month , but no more than 1,800 euros . every second man in germany says he would take time off work to raise children , if he had the financial means to do so .
both christian democrats and social democrats were keen to improve the situation for parents , in order to boost germany ’ s low birth rate .

after five hours of discussions , leaders have reached compromises over a wealth tax and parental subsidies , but not health care . kurt beck , the designated leader of the social democratic party , was clearly buoyant after lengthy discussions over key reforms in the german chancellery . " we have come along very nicely and are on the way with all the important issues we wanted to tackle , " beck said .
" as you can see , i 'm very happy . " introducing reforms was seen as a key test for chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government .
for weeks the social democrats and christian democrats - who form the coalition - have argued over the reforms .
now it seems they have finally come to agreement , at least over some important issues .

most of them start off with a tourist visa and end up hiding out here illegally .
according to estimates by aid organizations , around one million foreigners live in german without proper resident permits or visas .
they are reluctant to speak about their often catastrophic situation for fear of being deported . frida is one example .
she 's african and , five years ago , was living in slave-like conditions in her home country : she was not permitted to leave the house and had no money of her own .
she fled and came to germany to stay with her aunt .
once here , she met her now fiancé - it was love at first sight . that is still the only way illegal immigrants can gain citizenship here - to marry a german .
another option - for women - is to have a child with a german man . illegal immigra n ts face deportatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german office for migration and refugees if they do not have proper papers , illegal immigrants will be deported since they are committing a criminal offense by staying in the country .
only so-called " deportation barriers " can protract them , said reinhard marx , an immigration lawyer . " legal deportation barriers include protection for internally displaced persons or asylum-seekers or protection from threats to immigrants ' lives , such as torture , should they face it in their home countries , " marx said .
" on the other hand , there are the rules governing the situation here : such as when an immigrant is sick or pregnant , making it inadvisable to deport that person due to health reasons . " illegal immigrants whose identities are not confirmed or who can not reach their home countries due to disrupted transportation routes , and therefore can not leave the country , are given a temporary stay permit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in berlin-kreuzberg many of the illegal immigrants who come to germany have followed relatives who are now living legally in the country .
the largest group of illegal aliens are turkish people , said ute koch of an organization called " living illegally . " " there are children and older people who want to live with their relatives residing in germany , but due to strict regulations illegal immigration is often the only thing left open to them , " she said .
" the possibilities for legal migration are very limited . " lose-lose situatio n once in the country , illegal aliens keep a low profile .
they can not protest if they are paid too little or not at all for their work , as they risk deportation .
employers often take advantage of the dilemma . when ill , illegal immigrants are forced to find a doctor who will treat them anonymously and who expects private payment , which most immigrants can not afford .
they therefore often wait until it is almost too late to receive proper treatment . that was the case with frida .
she had stomach pains for a long time and just took pain killers .
she collapsed one day in the city ; an ambulance took her to the hospital .
doctors discovered that she had gall stones .
she left the hospital after two days , for which she had to pay 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- , and still had not had an operation .
she continued to live with the pain until an aid organization arranged for surgery .
her gall bladder was already perforated ; had she let any more time pass , she would have died . not only had she not been able to pay for the operation - frida also feared police would track her down in the hospital .
though frida has just married and has a legal residence permit , she is still scared to talk .
the years of living illegally have made their mark . public kindergartens and schools are also required to notify police of children or families without proper resident permits .
the result : illegal immigrant children do not receive education , and are forced to stay inside out of fear of drawing attention to themselves by not being in school as required for minors . restricti n g illegal immigratio n harms the eco n omy one would think the easiest solution would be to crack down on illegal aliens even more .
but like in the united states , the demand for them is great .
illegal immigrants provide cheap labor and do the work most germans avoid , thomas straubhaar of the hamburg institute of international economics , said .

most of them start off with a tourist visa and end up hiding out here illegally .
according to estimates by aid organizations , around one million foreigners live in german without proper resident permits or visas .
they are reluctant to speak about their often catastrophic situation for fear of being deported . frida is one example .
she 's african and , five years ago , was living in slave-like conditions in her home country : she was not permitted to leave the house and had no money of her own .
she fled and came to germany to stay with her aunt .
once here , she met her now fiancé - it was love at first sight . that is still the only way illegal immigrants can gain citizenship here - to marry a german .
another option - for women - is to have a child with a german man . illegal immigra n ts face deportatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german office for migration and refugees if they do not have proper papers , illegal immigrants will be deported since they are committing a criminal offense by staying in the country .
only so-called " deportation barriers " can protract them , said reinhard marx , an immigration lawyer . " legal deportation barriers include protection for internally displaced persons or asylum-seekers or protection from threats to immigrants ' lives , such as torture , should they face it in their home countries , " marx said .
" on the other hand , there are the rules governing the situation here : such as when an immigrant is sick or pregnant , making it inadvisable to deport that person due to health reasons . " illegal immigrants whose identities are not confirmed or who can not reach their home countries due to disrupted transportation routes , and therefore can not leave the country , are given a temporary stay permit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in berlin-kreuzberg many of the illegal immigrants who come to germany have followed relatives who are now living legally in the country .
the largest group of illegal aliens are turkish people , said ute koch of an organization called " living illegally . " " there are children and older people who want to live with their relatives residing in germany , but due to strict regulations illegal immigration is often the only thing left open to them , " she said .
" the possibilities for legal migration are very limited . " lose-lose situatio n once in the country , illegal aliens keep a low profile .
they can not protest if they are paid too little or not at all for their work , as they risk deportation .
employers often take advantage of the dilemma . when ill , illegal immigrants are forced to find a doctor who will treat them anonymously and who expects private payment , which most immigrants can not afford .
they therefore often wait until it is almost too late to receive proper treatment . that was the case with frida .
she had stomach pains for a long time and just took pain killers .
she collapsed one day in the city ; an ambulance took her to the hospital .
doctors discovered that she had gall stones .
she left the hospital after two days , for which she had to pay 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- , and still had not had an operation .
she continued to live with the pain until an aid organization arranged for surgery .
her gall bladder was already perforated ; had she let any more time pass , she would have died . not only had she not been able to pay for the operation - frida also feared police would track her down in the hospital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.05.2006 ballroom dancing is mad hot trend among german teens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teens are learning social competence along with dance steps , according to one teacher for increasing numbers of german teenagers , partying no longer means long nights at the disco .
more and more teens are revisiting a pastime more often associated with their grandparents ' generation : ballroom dancing . if youth has its finger on the pulse of popular culture , then germany 's heart is beating to the rhythms of the rumba , cha-cha , foxtrot and waltz . mia hinrichs is a 15-year-old high school student from cologne whose passions include playing soccer and watching the " the gilmore girls " on television .
last year , when a boy in her class asked her if she would be his partner in a ballroom dancing class , she had to think twice before she agreed . but that was three classes ago , and mia and her friends - their number has since increased - are still going strong .
" i 'll keep it up if my parents allow me to keep going , " hinrichs said .
" i 'd like to get my bronze and silver -lrb- proficiency-level certificates . -rrb- " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drama of ballroom dancing was shown in baz luhrmann 's film " strictly ballroom " a ballroom dancing class was once an unavoidable rite of passage for middle- and upper-class german teens ; a necessary tool for getting by at social events like formal work functions and weddings .
but those classes began to fall out of favor in the 1980s and 90s . hip trend recently , hamburg dance teacher jan giesel told stern magazine that the " low point was 1996 … that 's when nothing was less cool that couples ' dancing . "
many dance schools did n't survive those decades ; those that did banked on hip hop and aerobics classes . now , however , ballroom is back .
the association of german dance schools -lrb- adtv -rrb- reports a 10 percent increase in overall attendance in dance schools across the country from 2004 to 2005 , and association spokeswoman antje kurz said she expects similar growth this year . " i used to think ballroom dance was old fashioned , but i guess it has become hip , " said thomas eck , a 15-year-old cologne high school student who has been studying ballroom dance along with hinrichs at cologne 's tanzschule breuer for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the film " mad hot ballroom , " inner city kids learned ballroom dancing " at first there were only six of us .
now there are at least 30 kids from my school who go , from different grades , " eck said .
" it 's become popular - it 's not just the total outsiders who take ballroom dance . " the power of reality shows the new popularity of standard dance goes hand in hand with a sudden , widespread presence of ballroom on the big and small screens .
recent movies have had titles like " strictly ballroom , " " shall we dance , " and " mad hot ballroom . "
the latter is a documentary on a social program for underprivileged new york school children , which successfully uses ballroom dance to teach life skills . and since early april , germany has been under the thrall of a reality television show called " let 's dance . "
based on britain 's outrageously popular " strictly come dancing " and its equally beloved american spawn " dancing with the stars , " " let 's dance " pairs b-list celebrities with professional ballroom dancers .
the semi-famous couples then compete , showing off their foxtrots , paso dobles , and rumbas for a professional jury and for viewers at home , who then call in to vote pairs off the show until a winner remains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more teens are taking dance courses in this hamburg school " let 's dance " regularly achieves audience ratings of around 20 percent ; the numbers are higher among 19 to 39 year olds , according to german marketing group quotameter . adtv 's kurz said another reason young people are increasingly drawn to dance class is that the schools themselves have changed .
gone are the dusty institutions that could count on teaching entire classes of preteens preparing for their first formal dance .
today 's schools have updated their music repertoires and added diverse array of activities , offering everything from videoclip dance to same-sex ballroom classes for gay couples . " the schools saw they had to do more to keep their clients .
now they are more like clubs .
they throw parties , have youth nights and workshops , or they 'll take a group out to a musical , " kurz said . etiquette and grace other observers say the trend is tied to a renewed interest in old-fashioned values like polish and politesse .
kids today long for security and constraints , they say .
and ballroom dance - with its evocation of supper-club class - fits the clean-fun bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , jennifer lopez starred in " shall we dance ? "
the adtv has even started a " no-disgrace " program , which calls on its members to go beyond teaching dance steps and enter the world of etiquette education .
they see dance schools as the perfect place for kids to learn how to present themselves in the wider world .
" good etiquette is cool , and keeps you from getting stressed out , " an ad on the adtv web site says . hans georg steinig , who runs the breuer dance school in cologne , agrees .
" my students are being prepared for life .
they will be ready for a job interview .
they learn how to present themselves , " he said . for steinig , teaching dance " is all about social competence .
they have to change partners , and everyone is accepted , tolerated , not judged .
each class ends with a round of applause ; and the kids have to look in each others ' eyes . " " i teach the kids that they are not coming here to learn how to look good on the dance floor , " steinig said . " they are dancing for themselves and for their partner .
learning the steps is the best way to feel the music . " fifteen-year-old eck agrees .
" at the beginning it was a little boring , just to learn the steps .
but then you notice you get better , and it feels differrent when you really learn to move to the music .
it feels good . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart classic gets street treatment in berlin update mozart 's aria " cosi fan tutte " , hip-hop beats and german rap do n't usually go together .

more and more teens are revisiting a pastime more often associated with their grandparents ' generation : ballroom dancing . if youth has its finger on the pulse of popular culture , then germany 's heart is beating to the rhythms of the rumba , cha-cha , foxtrot and waltz . mia hinrichs is a 15-year-old high school student from cologne whose passions include playing soccer and watching the " the gilmore girls " on television .
last year , when a boy in her class asked her if she would be his partner in a ballroom dancing class , she had to think twice before she agreed . but that was three classes ago , and mia and her friends - their number has since increased - are still going strong .
" i 'll keep it up if my parents allow me to keep going , " hinrichs said .
" i 'd like to get my bronze and silver -lrb- proficiency-level certificates . -rrb- " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drama of ballroom dancing was shown in baz luhrmann 's film " strictly ballroom " a ballroom dancing class was once an unavoidable rite of passage for middle- and upper-class german teens ; a necessary tool for getting by at social events like formal work functions and weddings .
but those classes began to fall out of favor in the 1980s and 90s . hip trend recently , hamburg dance teacher jan giesel told stern magazine that the " low point was 1996 … that 's when nothing was less cool that couples ' dancing . "
many dance schools did n't survive those decades ; those that did banked on hip hop and aerobics classes . now , however , ballroom is back .
the association of german dance schools -lrb- adtv -rrb- reports a 10 percent increase in overall attendance in dance schools across the country from 2004 to 2005 , and association spokeswoman antje kurz said she expects similar growth this year . " i used to think ballroom dance was old fashioned , but i guess it has become hip , " said thomas eck , a 15-year-old cologne high school student who has been studying ballroom dance along with hinrichs at cologne 's tanzschule breuer for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the film " mad hot ballroom , " inner city kids learned ballroom dancing " at first there were only six of us .
now there are at least 30 kids from my school who go , from different grades , " eck said .
" it 's become popular - it 's not just the total outsiders who take ballroom dance . " the power of reality shows the new popularity of standard dance goes hand in hand with a sudden , widespread presence of ballroom on the big and small screens .
recent movies have had titles like " strictly ballroom , " " shall we dance , " and " mad hot ballroom . "
the latter is a documentary on a social program for underprivileged new york school children , which successfully uses ballroom dance to teach life skills . and since early april , germany has been under the thrall of a reality television show called " let 's dance . "
based on britain 's outrageously popular " strictly come dancing " and its equally beloved american spawn " dancing with the stars , " " let 's dance " pairs b-list celebrities with professional ballroom dancers .
the semi-famous couples then compete , showing off their foxtrots , paso dobles , and rumbas for a professional jury and for viewers at home , who then call in to vote pairs off the show until a winner remains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more teens are taking dance courses in this hamburg school " let 's dance " regularly achieves audience ratings of around 20 percent ; the numbers are higher among 19 to 39 year olds , according to german marketing group quotameter . adtv 's kurz said another reason young people are increasingly drawn to dance class is that the schools themselves have changed .
gone are the dusty institutions that could count on teaching entire classes of preteens preparing for their first formal dance .
today 's schools have updated their music repertoires and added diverse array of activities , offering everything from videoclip dance to same-sex ballroom classes for gay couples . " the schools saw they had to do more to keep their clients .
now they are more like clubs .
they throw parties , have youth nights and workshops , or they 'll take a group out to a musical , " kurz said . etiquette and grace other observers say the trend is tied to a renewed interest in old-fashioned values like polish and politesse .
kids today long for security and constraints , they say .
and ballroom dance - with its evocation of supper-club class - fits the clean-fun bill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , jennifer lopez starred in " shall we dance ? "
the adtv has even started a " no-disgrace " program , which calls on its members to go beyond teaching dance steps and enter the world of etiquette education .
they see dance schools as the perfect place for kids to learn how to present themselves in the wider world .
" good etiquette is cool , and keeps you from getting stressed out , " an ad on the adtv web site says . hans georg steinig , who runs the breuer dance school in cologne , agrees .
" my students are being prepared for life .
they will be ready for a job interview .
they learn how to present themselves , " he said . for steinig , teaching dance " is all about social competence .
they have to change partners , and everyone is accepted , tolerated , not judged .
each class ends with a round of applause ; and the kids have to look in each others ' eyes . " " i teach the kids that they are not coming here to learn how to look good on the dance floor , " steinig said . " they are dancing for themselves and for their partner .
learning the steps is the best way to feel the music . " fifteen-year-old eck agrees .
" at the beginning it was a little boring , just to learn the steps .
but then you notice you get better , and it feels differrent when you really learn to move to the music .
it feels good . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart classic gets street treatment in berlin update mozart 's aria " cosi fan tutte " , hip-hop beats and german rap do n't usually go together .

most of them start off with a tourist visa and end up hiding out here illegally .
according to estimates by aid organizations , around one million foreigners live in german without proper resident permits or visas .
they are reluctant to speak about their often catastrophic situation for fear of being deported . frida is one example .
she 's african and , five years ago , was living in slave-like conditions in her home country : she was not permitted to leave the house and had no money of her own .
she fled and came to germany to stay with her aunt .
once here , she met her now fiancé - it was love at first sight . that is still the only way illegal immigrants can gain citizenship here - to marry a german .
another option - for women - is to have a child with a german man . illegal immigra n ts face deportatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german office for migration and refugees if they do not have proper papers , illegal immigrants will be deported since they are committing a criminal offense by staying in the country .
only so-called " deportation barriers " can protract them , said reinhard marx , an immigration lawyer . " legal deportation barriers include protection for internally displaced persons or asylum-seekers or protection from threats to immigrants ' lives , such as torture , should they face it in their home countries , " marx said .
" on the other hand , there are the rules governing the situation here : such as when an immigrant is sick or pregnant , making it inadvisable to deport that person due to health reasons . " illegal immigrants whose identities are not confirmed or who can not reach their home countries due to disrupted transportation routes , and therefore can not leave the country , are given a temporary stay permit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in berlin-kreuzberg many of the illegal immigrants who come to germany have followed relatives who are now living legally in the country .
the largest group of illegal aliens are turkish people , said ute koch of an organization called " living illegally . " " there are children and older people who want to live with their relatives residing in germany , but due to strict regulations illegal immigration is often the only thing left open to them , " she said .
" the possibilities for legal migration are very limited . " lose-lose situatio n once in the country , illegal aliens keep a low profile .
they can not protest if they are paid too little or not at all for their work , as they risk deportation .
employers often take advantage of the dilemma . when ill , illegal immigrants are forced to find a doctor who will treat them anonymously and who expects private payment , which most immigrants can not afford .
they therefore often wait until it is almost too late to receive proper treatment . that was the case with frida .
she had stomach pains for a long time and just took pain killers .
she collapsed one day in the city ; an ambulance took her to the hospital .
doctors discovered that she had gall stones .
she left the hospital after two days , for which she had to pay 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- , and still had not had an operation .
she continued to live with the pain until an aid organization arranged for surgery .
her gall bladder was already perforated ; had she let any more time pass , she would have died . not only had she not been able to pay for the operation - frida also feared police would track her down in the hospital .
though frida has just married and has a legal residence permit , she is still scared to talk .
the years of living illegally have made their mark . public kindergartens and schools are also required to notify police of children or families without proper resident permits .
the result : illegal immigrant children do not receive education , and are forced to stay inside out of fear of drawing attention to themselves by not being in school as required for minors . restricti n g illegal immigratio n harms the eco n omy one would think the easiest solution would be to crack down on illegal aliens even more .
but like in the united states , the demand for them is great .
illegal immigrants provide cheap labor and do the work most germans avoid , thomas straubhaar of the hamburg institute of international economics , said . " even if it sounds odd , it 's true that - given the current regulations - germany is dependent on illegal employment of foreign laborers , " straubhaar said . heidi schmidt -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu must change its immigration policy , experts warn rather than building the walls around " fortress europe " higher , as many eu politicians favor , migration experts say the eu needs a new progressive policy on immigration - for its own good .

while it has been possible to unite some liberal jewish currents under the umbrella of the central council , the integration of the tens of thousands of eastern european jewish migrants is still in its infancy and the council 's next president will need to sort out the ongoing rivalry between jewish migrants and the native german community , according to julius schöps of the felix mendelsohn center in potsdam . " if we look further ahead , we 'll see that there can be no more representatives of the old jewish community in germany following in paul spiegel 's footsteps , " he said .
" we might eventually see someone from the former soviet union taking over as head of the central council .

as mourning continues for the late president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , debate about who is best suited to fully integrate germany 's 90,000 jewish migrants from eastern europe has begun . most people involved with the search for a successor understand spiegel was the last council head who consciously lived through the horrors of the holocaust .
whoever will follow in his footsteps is bound to bring with him different views on how to further develop post-war jewish life in germany .
but that 's where the common ground ends . for some prominent members of germany 's jewish community , the outcome of elections for the post of jewish council president , to be held in november , is a foregone conclusion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn decided not to run for the president position in 1999 they believe paul spiegel 's successor can be no other than salomon korn -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 62-year-old jewish architect from frankfurt and one of spiegel 's closest friends .
as the council 's vice-president , korn has played an important role in the expansion of jewish communities across germany . too early to make a decisio n but it 's still much too early to draw any conclusions , according to leading jewish figure micha brumlik .
he said he feels it is inappropriate to focus on a specific name so shortly after spiegel 's death last sunday and would rather concentrate on the abilities the next president should have . " i think we should have somebody at the helm of the council who was born after the second world war , " he said .
" we need someone who has thoroughly analyzed germany 's post-war efforts to come to terms with its history , and its endeavors to build up a new relationship with us jews . " though the german jewish community 's time of remembrance is not over , integration is the newest challenge that needs to be tackled , brumlick added . bo n di n g germa n y 's jewish commu n ities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was paul spiegel the last head to come from germany 's old jewish community ?

the bbc 's director of global news , richard sambrook , looks at how big brands are coping with the digital revolution .
in the 1960s , bands like the rolling stones led a musical revolution if web 2.0 is the new rock ' n ' roll , who are the one-hit wonders and who will still be playing to packed stadiums in 40 years ' time ?
the comparison is n't quite as ridiculous as it may appear .
forty years ago , music was leading a social revolution , disrupting the establishment and empowering a new generation .
today 's web technology and social media , known as web 2.0 , or the second wave of the internet , are leading a similar challenge and the long-term effects are likely to be greater .
once again we are divided into those who get it and those who do n't .
there is hyperventilating on the blog barricades about the end of the old order and the birth of the new counter-culture , information anarchy .
the question of trust is paramount in an age where news is everywhere alfred hermida our technology editor blogs on the future of media but , just as in the music revolution , it is often the most creative and the most challenging who are negotiating major commercial deals which will secure their future .
much of the media coverage has , of course , been about the effects on the media , such as citizen journalism , and sites like bebo , youtube and flickr .
but the impact of this revolution in digital information is being felt across all professions from education , to health , to law , finance , and more .
the trust factor there is a social restructuring under way with more power , and responsibility , flowing towards the individual and away from major companies , institutions and professionals .
murdoch has talked of a shift in power from the established elite as individuals now have the information to challenge what once they accepted at face value it raises big issues , not least , who do you trust ?
in the new world of free information and choice , trust becomes a key factor determining which sites and companies succeed and which do not .
major corporations have recognised the wave of change and are now positioning themselves , as best they can , to ride it .
rupert murdoch in march noted how " power is moving away from the old elite " towards the consumers and , having bought one of the most successful social networking websites , myspace , pledged to put it at the heart of his operations .
reuters ceo tom glocer said earlier this year : " our industry is facing a profound challenge from home-created content .
" if we create the right crossroads , provide the consumers with the appropriate tools ... we can harness what otherwise from the outside would look like a punk revolution . "
and last week the bbc 's director general mark thompson unveiled his creative vision , recognising that technology is creating " seismic shifts in public expectations , lifestyles and behaviours " and outlined his plans to take the corporation into the on-demand age .
corporate beasts the reaction to these announcements is predictably mixed .
some commentators welcome them as an indication of great services in development by strong organisations .
others do not see the need for established media to move into this new ground .
news organisations like the bbc are adapting to the digital world competitors worry about the big beasts of the corporate media world crowding out others , and perhaps inhibiting innovation .
in the world of blogs these announcements are variously greeted as the death throes of media dinosaurs , ludicrously late to the technology game the enthusiasts have been playing for a decade , or sinister and threatening as the big multi-nationals take over the playground .
this is a false debate taking place in a media bubble .
the truth is more straightforward .
we are at a moment of opportunity and change .
technology , in gestation for 10 years through the first wave of digital , is about to bring to the heart of people 's lives a degree of choice and control which is still hard to grasp .
that in turn is changing the assumptions and behaviour of the public , from how they consume media to their expectations of public services and politicians .
they will determine the future .
public choice at such a moment we badly need the creativity , innovation and challenge of the digital rebels .
but we also need the experience , resources , standards , accountability and reach of big trusted brands .
the two can , and will , work together .
both will learn from each other .
just as rock ' n ' roll was brought to the mainstream by the music companies , the benefits of the digital revolution will flow through big business too .
it will not always be a happy marriage and not all will succeed .
some familiar brands will disappear and new powerful ones will emerge .
those who can embrace innovation , respond to challenge and partner them with the strengths of a major organisation will be the most successful .
but it will not be a success determined in the boardrooms or by the technical geeks .
it will be determined by the public making choices about what they value and who they trust .
they may have some surprises in store for all of us .
the we media global forum is taking place in london from 3 to 4 may .
it brings together major media companies with developers and bloggers from around the world .
your thoughts and comments : the discussion assumes the web world we know will continue .
i believe right now we are in a brief wonderful period of unfettered access to material and methods : an enlightenment .
but it is a very , very brief period .
the sudden burst of technology was driven by engineers doing what they saw was possible - no one told them to do anything different .
but businessmen pay the salaries and tell engineers what to do .
now they realise what is happening they demand control , of content by digital rights management so it can be viewed when and where they say , with the payment they choose , control of methods so new material belongs to them , control of communications , of web pages .
if i were a businessman who owned content i would have every engineer i could afford working out how to make very small charges -lrb- micropayments -rrb- for every web page you viewed , every email you sent , every video you played .
i 'd make sure nothing that was n't clearly owned by someone was viewable , doable , shareable at all .
i 'd make sure my engineers worked with microsoft 's , and murdoch 's , and every other major player who shared the same interest : making money from this free-for all .
micropayments need control .
control needs ownership , protection , prohibition .
enjoy it while it lasts ; it wo n't be here for long .
stephen woodruff , university of glasgow , scotland no doubt technology advancement is perfect , real essence of media is public trust , honest and impartial .
what are achievements of media , some times reporting & analysis appears little contaminated , or influenced .
syed hasan turab , milwaukee usa i welcome the decline of big news organizations which have always dictated what is " news " with no dispute or discussion allowed .
but trust is still an issue and there is a lot of spin and self-interest out there .
rss feeds and podcasts are two things which look good for the consumer to be able to select information among all the chatter and junk .
jeremy , atlanta , georgia social change from the internet is inevitable .
when i was at school in the 80s , we were told that one day we will be able to work , shop and do our everyday living from home - this was considered science-fiction .
however , terrorism , bird flu , rising oil-prices , street crime and an aging population will soon contribute to make the net even more central to our lives and make 80 's science fiction , 21st century science fact .
richard melton , spain i think digital technologies will never be a problem because they can not overcome completely any existing method , it simply complements them .
there are plenty people in the world to cover all different types of products and business .
for instance , i might prefer to read news online , listen to online radio stations , but does n't mean i will stop buying newspapers or stereos for my house .
the market is vast and there are people who prefer " old fashion " methods to achieve whatever they want and that should always be a priority in as well .
digital might make it easier and more interactive , however it is a different approach it is not yet available world wide neither to people from all backgrounds .
kell , uk there is no doubt that that the online world has now directly influenced our physical world and the power of sites such as google , ebay , and amazon is testament to this .
technology has always been a tool for both good and bad .
i have always however been amused and bemused by blogs .
they are self indulgent rantings of people who need to occasionally turn off their computers and get a life .
the rise of blogs is synonymous with reality tv , and lifestyle / decorating shows .
we shall soon drown in a see of opinionated self important tripe .
the more that is produced the less you want to care .
when people had to actually bother to find a soap box and go outside to make a comment there was perhaps some reason to stop and listen .
words are cheep now and some bored office worker sitting at a computer living in some fantasy land is not my opinion a new wave or revolution .

the bbc 's director of global news , richard sambrook , looks at how big brands are coping with the digital revolution .
in the 1960s , bands like the rolling stones led a musical revolution if web 2.0 is the new rock ' n ' roll , who are the one-hit wonders and who will still be playing to packed stadiums in 40 years ' time ?
the comparison is n't quite as ridiculous as it may appear .
forty years ago , music was leading a social revolution , disrupting the establishment and empowering a new generation .
today 's web technology and social media , known as web 2.0 , or the second wave of the internet , are leading a similar challenge and the long-term effects are likely to be greater .
once again we are divided into those who get it and those who do n't .
there is hyperventilating on the blog barricades about the end of the old order and the birth of the new counter-culture , information anarchy .
the question of trust is paramount in an age where news is everywhere alfred hermida our technology editor blogs on the future of media but , just as in the music revolution , it is often the most creative and the most challenging who are negotiating major commercial deals which will secure their future .
much of the media coverage has , of course , been about the effects on the media , such as citizen journalism , and sites like bebo , youtube and flickr .
but the impact of this revolution in digital information is being felt across all professions from education , to health , to law , finance , and more .
the trust factor there is a social restructuring under way with more power , and responsibility , flowing towards the individual and away from major companies , institutions and professionals .
murdoch has talked of a shift in power from the established elite as individuals now have the information to challenge what once they accepted at face value it raises big issues , not least , who do you trust ?
in the new world of free information and choice , trust becomes a key factor determining which sites and companies succeed and which do not .
major corporations have recognised the wave of change and are now positioning themselves , as best they can , to ride it .
rupert murdoch in march noted how " power is moving away from the old elite " towards the consumers and , having bought one of the most successful social networking websites , myspace , pledged to put it at the heart of his operations .
reuters ceo tom glocer said earlier this year : " our industry is facing a profound challenge from home-created content .
" if we create the right crossroads , provide the consumers with the appropriate tools ... we can harness what otherwise from the outside would look like a punk revolution . "
and last week the bbc 's director general mark thompson unveiled his creative vision , recognising that technology is creating " seismic shifts in public expectations , lifestyles and behaviours " and outlined his plans to take the corporation into the on-demand age .
corporate beasts the reaction to these announcements is predictably mixed .
some commentators welcome them as an indication of great services in development by strong organisations .
others do not see the need for established media to move into this new ground .
news organisations like the bbc are adapting to the digital world competitors worry about the big beasts of the corporate media world crowding out others , and perhaps inhibiting innovation .
in the world of blogs these announcements are variously greeted as the death throes of media dinosaurs , ludicrously late to the technology game the enthusiasts have been playing for a decade , or sinister and threatening as the big multi-nationals take over the playground .
this is a false debate taking place in a media bubble .
the truth is more straightforward .
we are at a moment of opportunity and change .
technology , in gestation for 10 years through the first wave of digital , is about to bring to the heart of people 's lives a degree of choice and control which is still hard to grasp .
that in turn is changing the assumptions and behaviour of the public , from how they consume media to their expectations of public services and politicians .
they will determine the future .
public choice at such a moment we badly need the creativity , innovation and challenge of the digital rebels .
but we also need the experience , resources , standards , accountability and reach of big trusted brands .
the two can , and will , work together .
both will learn from each other .
just as rock ' n ' roll was brought to the mainstream by the music companies , the benefits of the digital revolution will flow through big business too .
it will not always be a happy marriage and not all will succeed .
some familiar brands will disappear and new powerful ones will emerge .
those who can embrace innovation , respond to challenge and partner them with the strengths of a major organisation will be the most successful .
but it will not be a success determined in the boardrooms or by the technical geeks .
it will be determined by the public making choices about what they value and who they trust .
they may have some surprises in store for all of us .
the we media global forum is taking place in london from 3 to 4 may .
it brings together major media companies with developers and bloggers from around the world .
your thoughts and comments : the discussion assumes the web world we know will continue .
i believe right now we are in a brief wonderful period of unfettered access to material and methods : an enlightenment .
but it is a very , very brief period .
the sudden burst of technology was driven by engineers doing what they saw was possible - no one told them to do anything different .
but businessmen pay the salaries and tell engineers what to do .
now they realise what is happening they demand control , of content by digital rights management so it can be viewed when and where they say , with the payment they choose , control of methods so new material belongs to them , control of communications , of web pages .
if i were a businessman who owned content i would have every engineer i could afford working out how to make very small charges -lrb- micropayments -rrb- for every web page you viewed , every email you sent , every video you played .
i 'd make sure nothing that was n't clearly owned by someone was viewable , doable , shareable at all .
i 'd make sure my engineers worked with microsoft 's , and murdoch 's , and every other major player who shared the same interest : making money from this free-for all .
micropayments need control .
control needs ownership , protection , prohibition .
enjoy it while it lasts ; it wo n't be here for long .
stephen woodruff , university of glasgow , scotland no doubt technology advancement is perfect , real essence of media is public trust , honest and impartial .
what are achievements of media , some times reporting & analysis appears little contaminated , or influenced .
syed hasan turab , milwaukee usa i welcome the decline of big news organizations which have always dictated what is " news " with no dispute or discussion allowed .
but trust is still an issue and there is a lot of spin and self-interest out there .
rss feeds and podcasts are two things which look good for the consumer to be able to select information among all the chatter and junk .
jeremy , atlanta , georgia social change from the internet is inevitable .
when i was at school in the 80s , we were told that one day we will be able to work , shop and do our everyday living from home - this was considered science-fiction .
however , terrorism , bird flu , rising oil-prices , street crime and an aging population will soon contribute to make the net even more central to our lives and make 80 's science fiction , 21st century science fact .
richard melton , spain i think digital technologies will never be a problem because they can not overcome completely any existing method , it simply complements them .
there are plenty people in the world to cover all different types of products and business .
for instance , i might prefer to read news online , listen to online radio stations , but does n't mean i will stop buying newspapers or stereos for my house .
the market is vast and there are people who prefer " old fashion " methods to achieve whatever they want and that should always be a priority in as well .
digital might make it easier and more interactive , however it is a different approach it is not yet available world wide neither to people from all backgrounds .
kell , uk there is no doubt that that the online world has now directly influenced our physical world and the power of sites such as google , ebay , and amazon is testament to this .
technology has always been a tool for both good and bad .
i have always however been amused and bemused by blogs .
they are self indulgent rantings of people who need to occasionally turn off their computers and get a life .
the rise of blogs is synonymous with reality tv , and lifestyle / decorating shows .
we shall soon drown in a see of opinionated self important tripe .
the more that is produced the less you want to care .
when people had to actually bother to find a soap box and go outside to make a comment there was perhaps some reason to stop and listen .
words are cheep now and some bored office worker sitting at a computer living in some fantasy land is not my opinion a new wave or revolution .

the bbc 's director of global news , richard sambrook , looks at how big brands are coping with the digital revolution .
in the 1960s , bands like the rolling stones led a musical revolution if web 2.0 is the new rock ' n ' roll , who are the one-hit wonders and who will still be playing to packed stadiums in 40 years ' time ?
the comparison is n't quite as ridiculous as it may appear .
forty years ago , music was leading a social revolution , disrupting the establishment and empowering a new generation .
today 's web technology and social media , known as web 2.0 , or the second wave of the internet , are leading a similar challenge and the long-term effects are likely to be greater .
once again we are divided into those who get it and those who do n't .
there is hyperventilating on the blog barricades about the end of the old order and the birth of the new counter-culture , information anarchy .
the question of trust is paramount in an age where news is everywhere alfred hermida our technology editor blogs on the future of media but , just as in the music revolution , it is often the most creative and the most challenging who are negotiating major commercial deals which will secure their future .
much of the media coverage has , of course , been about the effects on the media , such as citizen journalism , and sites like bebo , youtube and flickr .
but the impact of this revolution in digital information is being felt across all professions from education , to health , to law , finance , and more .
the trust factor there is a social restructuring under way with more power , and responsibility , flowing towards the individual and away from major companies , institutions and professionals .
murdoch has talked of a shift in power from the established elite as individuals now have the information to challenge what once they accepted at face value it raises big issues , not least , who do you trust ?
in the new world of free information and choice , trust becomes a key factor determining which sites and companies succeed and which do not .
major corporations have recognised the wave of change and are now positioning themselves , as best they can , to ride it .
rupert murdoch in march noted how " power is moving away from the old elite " towards the consumers and , having bought one of the most successful social networking websites , myspace , pledged to put it at the heart of his operations .
reuters ceo tom glocer said earlier this year : " our industry is facing a profound challenge from home-created content .
" if we create the right crossroads , provide the consumers with the appropriate tools ... we can harness what otherwise from the outside would look like a punk revolution . "
and last week the bbc 's director general mark thompson unveiled his creative vision , recognising that technology is creating " seismic shifts in public expectations , lifestyles and behaviours " and outlined his plans to take the corporation into the on-demand age .
corporate beasts the reaction to these announcements is predictably mixed .
some commentators welcome them as an indication of great services in development by strong organisations .
others do not see the need for established media to move into this new ground .
news organisations like the bbc are adapting to the digital world competitors worry about the big beasts of the corporate media world crowding out others , and perhaps inhibiting innovation .
in the world of blogs these announcements are variously greeted as the death throes of media dinosaurs , ludicrously late to the technology game the enthusiasts have been playing for a decade , or sinister and threatening as the big multi-nationals take over the playground .
this is a false debate taking place in a media bubble .
the truth is more straightforward .
we are at a moment of opportunity and change .
technology , in gestation for 10 years through the first wave of digital , is about to bring to the heart of people 's lives a degree of choice and control which is still hard to grasp .
that in turn is changing the assumptions and behaviour of the public , from how they consume media to their expectations of public services and politicians .
they will determine the future .
public choice at such a moment we badly need the creativity , innovation and challenge of the digital rebels .
but we also need the experience , resources , standards , accountability and reach of big trusted brands .
the two can , and will , work together .
both will learn from each other .
just as rock ' n ' roll was brought to the mainstream by the music companies , the benefits of the digital revolution will flow through big business too .
it will not always be a happy marriage and not all will succeed .
some familiar brands will disappear and new powerful ones will emerge .
those who can embrace innovation , respond to challenge and partner them with the strengths of a major organisation will be the most successful .
but it will not be a success determined in the boardrooms or by the technical geeks .
it will be determined by the public making choices about what they value and who they trust .
they may have some surprises in store for all of us .
the we media global forum is taking place in london from 3 to 4 may .
it brings together major media companies with developers and bloggers from around the world .
your thoughts and comments : the discussion assumes the web world we know will continue .
i believe right now we are in a brief wonderful period of unfettered access to material and methods : an enlightenment .
but it is a very , very brief period .
the sudden burst of technology was driven by engineers doing what they saw was possible - no one told them to do anything different .
but businessmen pay the salaries and tell engineers what to do .
now they realise what is happening they demand control , of content by digital rights management so it can be viewed when and where they say , with the payment they choose , control of methods so new material belongs to them , control of communications , of web pages .
if i were a businessman who owned content i would have every engineer i could afford working out how to make very small charges -lrb- micropayments -rrb- for every web page you viewed , every email you sent , every video you played .
i 'd make sure nothing that was n't clearly owned by someone was viewable , doable , shareable at all .
i 'd make sure my engineers worked with microsoft 's , and murdoch 's , and every other major player who shared the same interest : making money from this free-for all .
micropayments need control .
control needs ownership , protection , prohibition .
enjoy it while it lasts ; it wo n't be here for long .
stephen woodruff , university of glasgow , scotland no doubt technology advancement is perfect , real essence of media is public trust , honest and impartial .
what are achievements of media , some times reporting & analysis appears little contaminated , or influenced .
syed hasan turab , milwaukee usa i welcome the decline of big news organizations which have always dictated what is " news " with no dispute or discussion allowed .
but trust is still an issue and there is a lot of spin and self-interest out there .
rss feeds and podcasts are two things which look good for the consumer to be able to select information among all the chatter and junk .
jeremy , atlanta , georgia social change from the internet is inevitable .
when i was at school in the 80s , we were told that one day we will be able to work , shop and do our everyday living from home - this was considered science-fiction .
however , terrorism , bird flu , rising oil-prices , street crime and an aging population will soon contribute to make the net even more central to our lives and make 80 's science fiction , 21st century science fact .
richard melton , spain i think digital technologies will never be a problem because they can not overcome completely any existing method , it simply complements them .
there are plenty people in the world to cover all different types of products and business .
for instance , i might prefer to read news online , listen to online radio stations , but does n't mean i will stop buying newspapers or stereos for my house .
the market is vast and there are people who prefer " old fashion " methods to achieve whatever they want and that should always be a priority in as well .
digital might make it easier and more interactive , however it is a different approach it is not yet available world wide neither to people from all backgrounds .
kell , uk there is no doubt that that the online world has now directly influenced our physical world and the power of sites such as google , ebay , and amazon is testament to this .
technology has always been a tool for both good and bad .
i have always however been amused and bemused by blogs .
they are self indulgent rantings of people who need to occasionally turn off their computers and get a life .
the rise of blogs is synonymous with reality tv , and lifestyle / decorating shows .
we shall soon drown in a see of opinionated self important tripe .
the more that is produced the less you want to care .
when people had to actually bother to find a soap box and go outside to make a comment there was perhaps some reason to stop and listen .
words are cheep now and some bored office worker sitting at a computer living in some fantasy land is not my opinion a new wave or revolution .

once again we are divided into those who get it and those who do n't .
there is hyperventilating on the blog barricades about the end of the old order and the birth of the new counter-culture , information anarchy .
the question of trust is paramount in an age where news is everywhere alfred hermida our technology editor blogs on the future of media but , just as in the music revolution , it is often the most creative and the most challenging who are negotiating major commercial deals which will secure their future .
much of the media coverage has , of course , been about the effects on the media , such as citizen journalism , and sites like bebo , youtube and flickr .
but the impact of this revolution in digital information is being felt across all professions from education , to health , to law , finance , and more .
the trust factor there is a social restructuring under way with more power , and responsibility , flowing towards the individual and away from major companies , institutions and professionals .
murdoch has talked of a shift in power from the established elite as individuals now have the information to challenge what once they accepted at face value it raises big issues , not least , who do you trust ?
in the new world of free information and choice , trust becomes a key factor determining which sites and companies succeed and which do not .
major corporations have recognised the wave of change and are now positioning themselves , as best they can , to ride it .
rupert murdoch in march noted how " power is moving away from the old elite " towards the consumers and , having bought one of the most successful social networking websites , myspace , pledged to put it at the heart of his operations .
reuters ceo tom glocer said earlier this year : " our industry is facing a profound challenge from home-created content .
" if we create the right crossroads , provide the consumers with the appropriate tools ... we can harness what otherwise from the outside would look like a punk revolution . "
and last week the bbc 's director general mark thompson unveiled his creative vision , recognising that technology is creating " seismic shifts in public expectations , lifestyles and behaviours " and outlined his plans to take the corporation into the on-demand age .
corporate beasts the reaction to these announcements is predictably mixed .
some commentators welcome them as an indication of great services in development by strong organisations .
others do not see the need for established media to move into this new ground .
news organisations like the bbc are adapting to the digital world competitors worry about the big beasts of the corporate media world crowding out others , and perhaps inhibiting innovation .
in the world of blogs these announcements are variously greeted as the death throes of media dinosaurs , ludicrously late to the technology game the enthusiasts have been playing for a decade , or sinister and threatening as the big multi-nationals take over the playground .
this is a false debate taking place in a media bubble .
the truth is more straightforward .
we are at a moment of opportunity and change .
technology , in gestation for 10 years through the first wave of digital , is about to bring to the heart of people 's lives a degree of choice and control which is still hard to grasp .
that in turn is changing the assumptions and behaviour of the public , from how they consume media to their expectations of public services and politicians .
they will determine the future .
public choice at such a moment we badly need the creativity , innovation and challenge of the digital rebels .
but we also need the experience , resources , standards , accountability and reach of big trusted brands .
the two can , and will , work together .
both will learn from each other .
just as rock ' n ' roll was brought to the mainstream by the music companies , the benefits of the digital revolution will flow through big business too .
it will not always be a happy marriage and not all will succeed .
some familiar brands will disappear and new powerful ones will emerge .
those who can embrace innovation , respond to challenge and partner them with the strengths of a major organisation will be the most successful .
but it will not be a success determined in the boardrooms or by the technical geeks .
it will be determined by the public making choices about what they value and who they trust .
they may have some surprises in store for all of us .

your thoughts and comments : the discussion assumes the web world we know will continue .
i believe right now we are in a brief wonderful period of unfettered access to material and methods : an enlightenment .
but it is a very , very brief period .
the sudden burst of technology was driven by engineers doing what they saw was possible - no one told them to do anything different .
but businessmen pay the salaries and tell engineers what to do .
now they realise what is happening they demand control , of content by digital rights management so it can be viewed when and where they say , with the payment they choose , control of methods so new material belongs to them , control of communications , of web pages .
if i were a businessman who owned content i would have every engineer i could afford working out how to make very small charges -lrb- micropayments -rrb- for every web page you viewed , every email you sent , every video you played .
i 'd make sure nothing that was n't clearly owned by someone was viewable , doable , shareable at all .
i 'd make sure my engineers worked with microsoft 's , and murdoch 's , and every other major player who shared the same interest : making money from this free-for all .
micropayments need control .
control needs ownership , protection , prohibition .
enjoy it while it lasts ; it wo n't be here for long .
stephen woodruff , university of glasgow , scotland no doubt technology advancement is perfect , real essence of media is public trust , honest and impartial .
what are achievements of media , some times reporting & analysis appears little contaminated , or influenced .
syed hasan turab , milwaukee usa i welcome the decline of big news organizations which have always dictated what is " news " with no dispute or discussion allowed .
but trust is still an issue and there is a lot of spin and self-interest out there .
rss feeds and podcasts are two things which look good for the consumer to be able to select information among all the chatter and junk .
jeremy , atlanta , georgia social change from the internet is inevitable .
when i was at school in the 80s , we were told that one day we will be able to work , shop and do our everyday living from home - this was considered science-fiction .
however , terrorism , bird flu , rising oil-prices , street crime and an aging population will soon contribute to make the net even more central to our lives and make 80 's science fiction , 21st century science fact .
richard melton , spain i think digital technologies will never be a problem because they can not overcome completely any existing method , it simply complements them .
there are plenty people in the world to cover all different types of products and business .
for instance , i might prefer to read news online , listen to online radio stations , but does n't mean i will stop buying newspapers or stereos for my house .
the market is vast and there are people who prefer " old fashion " methods to achieve whatever they want and that should always be a priority in as well .
digital might make it easier and more interactive , however it is a different approach it is not yet available world wide neither to people from all backgrounds .
kell , uk there is no doubt that that the online world has now directly influenced our physical world and the power of sites such as google , ebay , and amazon is testament to this .
technology has always been a tool for both good and bad .
i have always however been amused and bemused by blogs .
they are self indulgent rantings of people who need to occasionally turn off their computers and get a life .
the rise of blogs is synonymous with reality tv , and lifestyle / decorating shows .
we shall soon drown in a see of opinionated self important tripe .
the more that is produced the less you want to care .
when people had to actually bother to find a soap box and go outside to make a comment there was perhaps some reason to stop and listen .

rupert murdoch in march noted how " power is moving away from the old elite " towards the consumers and , having bought one of the most successful social networking websites , myspace , pledged to put it at the heart of his operations .
reuters ceo tom glocer said earlier this year : " our industry is facing a profound challenge from home-created content .
" if we create the right crossroads , provide the consumers with the appropriate tools ... we can harness what otherwise from the outside would look like a punk revolution . "
and last week the bbc 's director general mark thompson unveiled his creative vision , recognising that technology is creating " seismic shifts in public expectations , lifestyles and behaviours " and outlined his plans to take the corporation into the on-demand age .
corporate beasts the reaction to these announcements is predictably mixed .
some commentators welcome them as an indication of great services in development by strong organisations .
others do not see the need for established media to move into this new ground .
competitors worry about the big beasts of the corporate media world crowding out others , and perhaps inhibiting innovation .
in the world of blogs these announcements are variously greeted as the death throes of media dinosaurs , ludicrously late to the technology game the enthusiasts have been playing for a decade , or sinister and threatening as the big multi-nationals take over the playground .
this is a false debate taking place in a media bubble .
the truth is more straightforward .
we are at a moment of opportunity and change .
technology , in gestation for 10 years through the first wave of digital , is about to bring to the heart of people 's lives a degree of choice and control which is still hard to grasp .
that in turn is changing the assumptions and behaviour of the public , from how they consume media to their expectations of public services and politicians .
they will determine the future .
public choice at such a moment we badly need the creativity , innovation and challenge of the digital rebels .
but we also need the experience , resources , standards , accountability and reach of big trusted brands .
the two can , and will , work together .
both will learn from each other .
just as rock ' n ' roll was brought to the mainstream by the music companies , the benefits of the digital revolution will flow through big business too .
it will not always be a happy marriage and not all will succeed .
some familiar brands will disappear and new powerful ones will emerge .
those who can embrace innovation , respond to challenge and partner them with the strengths of a major organisation will be the most successful .
but it will not be a success determined in the boardrooms or by the technical geeks .
it will be determined by the public making choices about what they value and who they trust .
they may have some surprises in store for all of us .
the we media global forum is taking place in london from 3 to 4 may .
it brings together major media companies with developers and bloggers from around the world .
your thoughts and comments : the discussion assumes the web world we know will continue .
i believe right now we are in a brief wonderful period of unfettered access to material and methods : an enlightenment .
but it is a very , very brief period .
the sudden burst of technology was driven by engineers doing what they saw was possible - no one told them to do anything different .
but businessmen pay the salaries and tell engineers what to do .
now they realise what is happening they demand control , of content by digital rights management so it can be viewed when and where they say , with the payment they choose , control of methods so new material belongs to them , control of communications , of web pages .
if i were a businessman who owned content i would have every engineer i could afford working out how to make very small charges -lrb- micropayments -rrb- for every web page you viewed , every email you sent , every video you played .
i 'd make sure nothing that was n't clearly owned by someone was viewable , doable , shareable at all .
i 'd make sure my engineers worked with microsoft 's , and murdoch 's , and every other major player who shared the same interest : making money from this free-for all .
micropayments need control .
control needs ownership , protection , prohibition .
enjoy it while it lasts ; it wo n't be here for long .
stephen woodruff , university of glasgow , scotland no doubt technology advancement is perfect , real essence of media is public trust , honest and impartial .
what are achievements of media , some times reporting & analysis appears little contaminated , or influenced .
syed hasan turab , milwaukee usa i welcome the decline of big news organizations which have always dictated what is " news " with no dispute or discussion allowed .
but trust is still an issue and there is a lot of spin and self-interest out there .
rss feeds and podcasts are two things which look good for the consumer to be able to select information among all the chatter and junk .
jeremy , atlanta , georgia social change from the internet is inevitable .
when i was at school in the 80s , we were told that one day we will be able to work , shop and do our everyday living from home - this was considered science-fiction .
however , terrorism , bird flu , rising oil-prices , street crime and an aging population will soon contribute to make the net even more central to our lives and make 80 's science fiction , 21st century science fact .
richard melton , spain i think digital technologies will never be a problem because they can not overcome completely any existing method , it simply complements them .
there are plenty people in the world to cover all different types of products and business .
for instance , i might prefer to read news online , listen to online radio stations , but does n't mean i will stop buying newspapers or stereos for my house .
the market is vast and there are people who prefer " old fashion " methods to achieve whatever they want and that should always be a priority in as well .
digital might make it easier and more interactive , however it is a different approach it is not yet available world wide neither to people from all backgrounds .
kell , uk there is no doubt that that the online world has now directly influenced our physical world and the power of sites such as google , ebay , and amazon is testament to this .
technology has always been a tool for both good and bad .
i have always however been amused and bemused by blogs .
they are self indulgent rantings of people who need to occasionally turn off their computers and get a life .
the rise of blogs is synonymous with reality tv , and lifestyle / decorating shows .
we shall soon drown in a see of opinionated self important tripe .
the more that is produced the less you want to care .
when people had to actually bother to find a soap box and go outside to make a comment there was perhaps some reason to stop and listen .
words are cheep now and some bored office worker sitting at a computer living in some fantasy land is not my opinion a new wave or revolution .

the imf 's report said that the region has been boosted by growing demand for exports , notably in electronics , which was set to continue .
in addition , the report said , domestic demand - which has been " tepid " everywhere except china and india - has been picking up since early 2005 .
but the rising price of oil still posed a threat to growth , the imf warned .
while more expensive energy has had a limited effect to date , further increases could dampen economic growth , the imf said .
governments could be forced to raise domestic fuel prices to stay in keeping with international prices , it added .
the challenge then would be to cope with the resulting rise in inflation without depressing domestic demand once more .
lower debts , better infrastructure even so , the imf 's overall outlook remains positive .
" the region should be able to weather such disturbances , since in sharp contrast to the mid-1990s , asset prices are not significantly overvalued and vulnerabilities are relatively low , " it says .
asian nations still need to lower their debts , the imf argues , while at the same time improving their public services and infrastructure .
at the same time , continued growth could depend on reducing the propensity of asian consumers - particularly in china - to save rather than spend , the imf says .
one way to achieve this could be to improve public education , healthcare and pension provision .
meanwhile bird flu could represent the biggest risk to the region , depending on how well the region is prepared - something which has not yet been tested .
currency stability the imf report comes ahead of a meeting in india of finance ministers from the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- , with india , china and japan on thursday .
members are expected to discuss how to stop currency turmoil and strengthen their financial systems .
as developed nations consider raising their interest rates there are concerns from some that this could be to the detriment of asia 's economies .
the meeting will coincide with the asian development bank 's annual meeting .

the imf 's report said that the region has been boosted by growing demand for exports , notably in electronics , which was set to continue .
in addition , the report said , domestic demand - which has been " tepid " everywhere except china and india - has been picking up since early 2005 .
but the rising price of oil still posed a threat to growth , the imf warned .
while more expensive energy has had a limited effect to date , further increases could dampen economic growth , the imf said .
governments could be forced to raise domestic fuel prices to stay in keeping with international prices , it added .
the challenge then would be to cope with the resulting rise in inflation without depressing domestic demand once more .
lower debts , better infrastructure even so , the imf 's overall outlook remains positive .
" the region should be able to weather such disturbances , since in sharp contrast to the mid-1990s , asset prices are not significantly overvalued and vulnerabilities are relatively low , " it says .
asian nations still need to lower their debts , the imf argues , while at the same time improving their public services and infrastructure .
at the same time , continued growth could depend on reducing the propensity of asian consumers - particularly in china - to save rather than spend , the imf says .
one way to achieve this could be to improve public education , healthcare and pension provision .
meanwhile bird flu could represent the biggest risk to the region , depending on how well the region is prepared - something which has not yet been tested .
currency stability the imf report comes ahead of a meeting in india of finance ministers from the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- , with india , china and japan on thursday .
members are expected to discuss how to stop currency turmoil and strengthen their financial systems .
as developed nations consider raising their interest rates there are concerns from some that this could be to the detriment of asia 's economies .
the meeting will coincide with the asian development bank 's annual meeting .

the firm said it was " evaluating a number of opportunities " .

the paper said that if a bid was successful , the consortium would break up ub , with premier holding onto its uk biscuits business .
ub is reported to be worth about £ 2.3bn , including some £ 1.9bn of debt .
the company was taken private in 2000 by a consortium consisting of us food company kraft and three private equity firms - cinven , pai partners and midocean partners .

organisers of the highbridge and burnham event say it could be cancelled unless more people come forward to offer help .
they say more people must volunteer to work in the days running up to the event and then to steward it .
the carnival has been running for 58 years and is part of the somerset county guy fawkes carnival circuit .
a statement on the highbridge and burnham-on-sea carnival association 's website said in 2005 the workload was taken on by a handful of volunteers who were reaching breaking point .
it said : " over the last few years numerous changes and added responsibilities have put a much higher workload onto the committee . "
it added that the costs of staging the event had escalated with insurance costs having more than trebled .
" we are afraid that without more help we will lose the carnival from our town and the charities their ' much needed ' income , " the statement said .
organisers of yeovil carnival say they are hopeful it will be back on in 2007 .
its president gary seymour said the club had no choice but to cancel because he and his wife are the only people left on the committee .
the club says it does not have enough stewards to run the event .
it is the first time the yeovil carnival has been cancelled in 30 years .

general secretary of the national association of head teachers mick brookes said it had " worrying " financial implications for schools .
the naht 's annual conference was also told that the " loving neglect " of some parents created barriers to education .
the department for education said extended school services were valued .
education secretary ruth kelly wants schools to open from 8am to 6pm .

he told delegates in harrogate that schools were " being inveigled into the administration of the national baby-sitting service " .
' worrying ' he continued : " the as yet unpublished guidance to schools on the financial aspects of extending schools is very worrying .
" the requirements to charge for some after-school activities and not for others , to co-ordinate community transport and to further erode financial capacity by raiding school budgets to support such schemes not only threatens administrative chaos but also the loss of goodwill that may well see the end of the traditional after-school club .

"
mr brookes said later : " condemning children to a 50-hour week - eight to six - does n't quite fit with my idea of childcare . "
he said the extended hours plan could see parents having to pay around £ 70 a week for their children 's after-school clubs .
a spokeswoman for the department for education said : " extended school services are valued in the communities they serve in , and are there for all young people , not least the most disadvantaged in our society . "
by 2010 ministers want all schools to be offering a range of clubs and out of school activities in line with ms kelly 's plan .
mr brookes also warned that a minority of parents were " washing their hands " of responsibility for their children .

" but there is a minority who create huge barriers to learning for their children and others by sending them to school in an unfit state to learn with negative and violent attitudes to authority , or who simply do n't send them at all . "
he warned that some pupils were too tired to pay attention in class because their parents failed to ensure they got to bed on time .
he said " some of it is children staying up far too late and playing video games in their bedrooms into the early hours and coming into school too tired to work .
" they are rather like me .
when i get tired , i get grumpy .
you end up with children on a shorter fuse because they are exhausted . "
he said he was probably talking about 5 % of families and stressed that most parents he had worked with in his time as a headteacher were " fantastically supportive " of the school .
but some parents " love their children too much to say no " .
