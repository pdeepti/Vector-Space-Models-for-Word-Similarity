" it was a relatively calm night , " a police spokesman said .
the interior ministry said there had been " few incidents . " a total of 277 vehicles were set on fire across the country , according to le monde newspaper , but the authorities refused to confirm the figure .
that figure was three times higher than the number of vehicles torched on a normal day in france . police said police and youths had also clashed in the northeastern city of reims and in toulouse in the southwest .
little has changed since then , some say last year 's riots were sparked by the deaths in clichy-sous-bois of zyed benna , 17 , and bouna traore , 15 , both from families of african descent .
they were electrocuted as they hid in an electricity sub-station after fleeing from police . riots broke out in clichy-sous-bois that night , quickly spreading to dozens of suburbs in the paris region and other french cities .
night after night for three weeks , mainly north african youths clashed with police , torching more than 10,000 cars and firebombing 300 buildings in around 275 towns , until order was officially restored on nov .

goalkeeper tim wiese recently boasted , " we are the best team in the league " while the club 's germany defender per mertesacker simply said that bremen were " on a roll . " despite the obvious buzz about bremen , the team have been cautioned by coach thomas schaaf about how over-confidence can suddenly bring everything crashing to earth . " we have a togetherness in the team and that is making the difference at the moment , " bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego said .
" we are top of the table and playing well , but we can not afford to relax as there is a long way to go before we achieve our season 's aims .

" the german tabloids have made out that bayern are in some sort of a crisis , but they have won all their champions league matches , are in the last 16 of the domestic cup and only three points behind bremen in the league , all of which hardly points to a crisis . " we have lost four important players in -lrb- michael -rrb- ballack , ze roberto , -lrb- jens -rrb- jeremies and -lrb- bixente -rrb- lizarazu .

we must now concentrate fully on the bundesliga and doing as well as we can in that competition , " said goalkeeper frank rost . coach mirko slomka emphasized that " we are joint bundesliga leaders with bremen , " but there was no getting away from the fact that his team faces another tough test at improving vfb stuttgart on sunday . stuttgart team manager horst heldt said that his side should not be deceived by schalke 's midweek flop . " i can see neither an advantage nor a disadvantage .
schalke have a big fighting spirit , " said heldt . hamburg start climbing the mountain along with schalke and bremen , sv hamburg were touted as challengers for the bundesliga title in the pre-season , but the club have a mountain to climb after a terrible start and are a full eight points behind bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paolo guerrero celebrates with coach thomas doll hamburg won their first match last weekend with a 2-1 triumph over bayer leverkusen and two-goal hero paolo guerrero hopes to build on that against hanover on saturday .

goalkeeper tim wiese recently boasted , " we are the best team in the league " while the club 's germany defender per mertesacker simply said that bremen were " on a roll . " despite the obvious buzz about bremen , the team have been cautioned by coach thomas schaaf about how over-confidence can suddenly bring everything crashing to earth . " we have a togetherness in the team and that is making the difference at the moment , " bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego said .
" we are top of the table and playing well , but we can not afford to relax as there is a long way to go before we achieve our season 's aims . " bayern 's aim is to retain the title for the third successive season but three defeats in their first eight games has heaped the pressure on ahead of saturday 's home fixture against eintracht frankfurt . no more mistakes for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's own goal last week summed up bayern 's luck " we need to win our three next home matches now and beat schalke away then we will see where we stand in the table , " bayern 's dutch midfielder marc van bommel said .
" we can not afford to make any more mistakes though . " the german tabloids have made out that bayern are in some sort of a crisis , but they have won all their champions league matches , are in the last 16 of the domestic cup and only three points behind bremen in the league , all of which hardly points to a crisis . " we have lost four important players in -lrb- michael -rrb- ballack , ze roberto , -lrb- jens -rrb- jeremies and -lrb- bixente -rrb- lizarazu .
perhaps we are lacking that little bit of experience , " said french defender willy sagnol . " it will be tough until the winter break .
i can only hope that the gap does n't become too big . " bayern were unimpressive in a 1-0 midweek cup win against second division kaiserslautern , but remain favored to beat eintracht frankfurt on saturday .
frankfurt are undefeated in the league , but a closer look at their results reveals just one win and seven draws .
to make things worse , eintracht have won just three matches in 36 trips to munich . cologne thrashing shocks schalke for schalke 04 , joint leaders with bremen , the league has now taken on additional meaning after a 4-2 extra-time national cup exit to second division cologne on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke can now concentrate on the league schalke are already out of the uefa cup , so a good season in the league is crucial and they will hope to go on a run starting against vfb stuttgart on sunday . " we wanted to do well in the cups but it has not happened .
we must now concentrate fully on the bundesliga and doing as well as we can in that competition , " said goalkeeper frank rost . coach mirko slomka emphasized that " we are joint bundesliga leaders with bremen , " but there was no getting away from the fact that his team faces another tough test at improving vfb stuttgart on sunday . stuttgart team manager horst heldt said that his side should not be deceived by schalke 's midweek flop . " i can see neither an advantage nor a disadvantage .
schalke have a big fighting spirit , " said heldt . hamburg start climbing the mountain along with schalke and bremen , sv hamburg were touted as challengers for the bundesliga title in the pre-season , but the club have a mountain to climb after a terrible start and are a full eight points behind bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paolo guerrero celebrates with coach thomas doll hamburg won their first match last weekend with a 2-1 triumph over bayer leverkusen and two-goal hero paolo guerrero hopes to build on that against hanover on saturday . " i think we should aim to start a run now .
the win in leverkusen should give us some confidence , " said peruvian international guerrero . third-placed hertha berlin , declared winners of their cup match at third division stuttgarter kickers which was abandoned after an assistant referee was hit by an object with the berlin club leading 2-0 , travel to energie cottbus on saturday . in saturday 's other games , nuremberg visit borussia dortmund , borussia mönchengladbach make the short journey to bayer leverkusen and bottom club vfl bochum face vfl wolfsburg .

goalkeeper tim wiese recently boasted , " we are the best team in the league " while the club 's germany defender per mertesacker simply said that bremen were " on a roll . " despite the obvious buzz about bremen , the team have been cautioned by coach thomas schaaf about how over-confidence can suddenly bring everything crashing to earth . " we have a togetherness in the team and that is making the difference at the moment , " bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego said .

" the german tabloids have made out that bayern are in some sort of a crisis , but they have won all their champions league matches , are in the last 16 of the domestic cup and only three points behind bremen in the league , all of which hardly points to a crisis . " we have lost four important players in -lrb- michael -rrb- ballack , ze roberto , -lrb- jens -rrb- jeremies and -lrb- bixente -rrb- lizarazu .
perhaps we are lacking that little bit of experience , " said french defender willy sagnol . " it will be tough until the winter break .
i can only hope that the gap does n't become too big . " bayern were unimpressive in a 1-0 midweek cup win against second division kaiserslautern , but remain favored to beat eintracht frankfurt on saturday .

we must now concentrate fully on the bundesliga and doing as well as we can in that competition , " said goalkeeper frank rost . coach mirko slomka emphasized that " we are joint bundesliga leaders with bremen , " but there was no getting away from the fact that his team faces another tough test at improving vfb stuttgart on sunday . stuttgart team manager horst heldt said that his side should not be deceived by schalke 's midweek flop . " i can see neither an advantage nor a disadvantage .
schalke have a big fighting spirit , " said heldt . hamburg start climbing the mountain along with schalke and bremen , sv hamburg were touted as challengers for the bundesliga title in the pre-season , but the club have a mountain to climb after a terrible start and are a full eight points behind bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paolo guerrero celebrates with coach thomas doll hamburg won their first match last weekend with a 2-1 triumph over bayer leverkusen and two-goal hero paolo guerrero hopes to build on that against hanover on saturday .

" it was a relatively calm night , " a police spokesman said .
the interior ministry said there had been " few incidents . " a total of 277 vehicles were set on fire across the country , according to le monde newspaper , but the authorities refused to confirm the figure .
that figure was three times higher than the number of vehicles torched on a normal day in france . police said police and youths had also clashed in the northeastern city of reims and in toulouse in the southwest .
little has changed since then , some say last year 's riots were sparked by the deaths in clichy-sous-bois of zyed benna , 17 , and bouna traore , 15 , both from families of african descent .
they were electrocuted as they hid in an electricity sub-station after fleeing from police . riots broke out in clichy-sous-bois that night , quickly spreading to dozens of suburbs in the paris region and other french cities .
night after night for three weeks , mainly north african youths clashed with police , torching more than 10,000 cars and firebombing 300 buildings in around 275 towns , until order was officially restored on nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga season 2006/07 : reports to the winter break werder bremen ahead of schalke on goal difference league leaders stuttgart face champions bayern in stiff test bremen stay top as schalke misfire at nuremberg schalke and bayern split points after bremen draw bundesliga -pipe- 28.10.2006 goal-happy bremen trounce struggling mainz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose chocked up two goals on friday werder bremen trounced strugglers mainz 05 6-1 to pull three points clear at the top of the bundesliga on friday . fresh after missing the midweek cup action bremen strolled past third from bottom mainz with doubles from miroslav klose and aaron hunt , and late strikes by naldo and diego . werder , assured of staying top of the league after the rest of the weekend 's games due to their vastly superior goal difference over closest rival schalke 04 , were following up last weekend 's 3-1 victory over reigning champions bayern munich , who are now lying six points behind . bremen 's confidence is hardly lacking .
goalkeeper tim wiese recently boasted , " we are the best team in the league " while the club 's germany defender per mertesacker simply said that bremen were " on a roll . " despite the obvious buzz about bremen , the team have been cautioned by coach thomas schaaf about how over-confidence can suddenly bring everything crashing to earth . " we have a togetherness in the team and that is making the difference at the moment , " bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego said .
" we are top of the table and playing well , but we can not afford to relax as there is a long way to go before we achieve our season 's aims . " bayern 's aim is to retain the title for the third successive season but three defeats in their first eight games has heaped the pressure on ahead of saturday 's home fixture against eintracht frankfurt . no more mistakes for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's own goal last week summed up bayern 's luck " we need to win our three next home matches now and beat schalke away then we will see where we stand in the table , " bayern 's dutch midfielder marc van bommel said .
" we can not afford to make any more mistakes though . " the german tabloids have made out that bayern are in some sort of a crisis , but they have won all their champions league matches , are in the last 16 of the domestic cup and only three points behind bremen in the league , all of which hardly points to a crisis . " we have lost four important players in -lrb- michael -rrb- ballack , ze roberto , -lrb- jens -rrb- jeremies and -lrb- bixente -rrb- lizarazu .
perhaps we are lacking that little bit of experience , " said french defender willy sagnol . " it will be tough until the winter break .

" it was a relatively calm night , " a police spokesman said .
the interior ministry said there had been " few incidents . " a total of 277 vehicles were set on fire across the country , according to le monde newspaper , but the authorities refused to confirm the figure .
that figure was three times higher than the number of vehicles torched on a normal day in france . police said police and youths had also clashed in the northeastern city of reims and in toulouse in the southwest .
little has changed since then , some say last year 's riots were sparked by the deaths in clichy-sous-bois of zyed benna , 17 , and bouna traore , 15 , both from families of african descent .
they were electrocuted as they hid in an electricity sub-station after fleeing from police . riots broke out in clichy-sous-bois that night , quickly spreading to dozens of suburbs in the paris region and other french cities .

" it was a relatively calm night , " a police spokesman said .
the interior ministry said there had been " few incidents . " a total of 277 vehicles were set on fire across the country , according to le monde newspaper , but the authorities refused to confirm the figure .
that figure was three times higher than the number of vehicles torched on a normal day in france . police said police and youths had also clashed in the northeastern city of reims and in toulouse in the southwest .
little has changed since then , some say last year 's riots were sparked by the deaths in clichy-sous-bois of zyed benna , 17 , and bouna traore , 15 , both from families of african descent .
they were electrocuted as they hid in an electricity sub-station after fleeing from police . riots broke out in clichy-sous-bois that night , quickly spreading to dozens of suburbs in the paris region and other french cities .
night after night for three weeks , mainly north african youths clashed with police , torching more than 10,000 cars and firebombing 300 buildings in around 275 towns , until order was officially restored on nov .
17 .

we need the calm , dignity and courage that are visible here to prevail .

" it has gone so far that i can no longer find referees for the worst teams , " he said . one radical suggestion being considered is to play games involving the worst teams with no referee , but this has faced stiff opposition for the other teams in the local league . böcking said he adamant that this will not happen , adding , " i would sooner abandon the whole season .

refs in the lowers leagues have no such luxury .
one regional division has become particularly lawless . being the main official at a soccer match these days is a lot more dangerous than it used to be .
however , it is n't just in high-profile games that the referees find themselves under threat .
the lower down the leagues you go , the worse it can be . the case of an assistant referee floored by a beer cup at a recent german cup game between hertha berlin and stuttgarter kickers caused controversy this week .
the game was abandoned - later to be awarded in favor of berlin who were winning 2-0 at the time - and the supporter responsible for the offense is now facing jail time after it was revealed that he had had brushes with the law in his past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish ref anders frisk was a high profile casualty things have gotten so bad in one region of germany that this sunday all games in the siegen-wittgenstein area have been called off because of increasing brutality in the local league . jürgen böcking , the chairperson of the region 's associations , cancelled 70 games this weekend .
" i have called off the whole match day , " böcking told the frankfürter allgemeine zeitung on friday . violence on the increase " the violence is constantly increasing in the lower leagues , " complained böcking , adding that his region is not an isolated case .
" i hear this from other areas too .
the fact is violence on the pitch and sidelines in getting worse . " siegen-wittgenstein is achieving a notoriety the local soccer association desperately wants to lose .
in july , an incident in which a referee was knocked down during a game and kicked in the stomach and genital area made headlines across germany .
the player involved got a 10-month ban . meanwhile , a female referee was so offended by the abuse she received during a game in august that she has hung her whistle up for good . " i 'm finished with it , " marina schneider said .
" players and drunken spectators insulted me , and i was also not taken seriously by the coaches . " black september for siegen-wittgenstein things reached tipping-point in september when a referee found a death threat in his changing room , informing him of the consequences of not allowing the home side to win . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : offensive weapons - in the wrong hands in other instances that month , a ref had to lock himself in his changing room to save himself from a mob of youth players ; another was attacked by players on the field ; and , in a separate game , one ref was taken to the hospital after being stabbed in the stomach by the linesman 's flag - brandished by the linesman himself . the situation in siegen-wittgenstein is so bad now that jürgen böcking struggles to find any officials to run any of the games . " it has gone so far that i can no longer find referees for the worst teams , " he said . one radical suggestion being considered is to play games involving the worst teams with no referee , but this has faced stiff opposition for the other teams in the local league . böcking said he adamant that this will not happen , adding , " i would sooner abandon the whole season . " siegen-wittgenstein 's sunday league is set to resume next week as normal .

" it was a relatively calm night , " a police spokesman said .
the interior ministry said there had been " few incidents . " a total of 277 vehicles were set on fire across the country , according to le monde newspaper , but the authorities refused to confirm the figure .
that figure was three times higher than the number of vehicles torched on a normal day in france . police said police and youths had also clashed in the northeastern city of reims and in toulouse in the southwest .
little has changed since then , some say last year 's riots were sparked by the deaths in clichy-sous-bois of zyed benna , 17 , and bouna traore , 15 , both from families of african descent .
they were electrocuted as they hid in an electricity sub-station after fleeing from police . riots broke out in clichy-sous-bois that night , quickly spreading to dozens of suburbs in the paris region and other french cities .
night after night for three weeks , mainly north african youths clashed with police , torching more than 10,000 cars and firebombing 300 buildings in around 275 towns , until order was officially restored on nov .

police are preparing for a sharp rise in anti-social behaviour to coincide with the annual festival .
statistics suggest there is a 20 % increase in nuisance crime around this time of the year .
according to the guardian , thousands of extra police officers will be on duty on tuesday .
some forces have issued safety advice cards and leaflets .
unmarked spotter cars will also be on patrol , looking out for unruly youths who take advantage of the night when many of the nation 's children will go out trick-or-treating .
donna bell , spokeswoman for cheshire police told the paper : " last year we received 1,519 calls on halloween , when the normal level would have been about 1,000 .
" the year before it was 1,317 and in 2003 is was 1,119 .
" last year , the majority of calls complained of damage to property , rowdy behaviour and intimidation .
" this year , for the first time we have issued 24,000 yes / no posters and a further 24,000 leaflets advising parents and children on what they can do to enjoy themselves peacefully . "
pc nick stephens from warwickshire police told the bbc the force is " cracking down " on halloween-inspired anti-social behaviour .
" our concern is that halloween is a time when young people are going to enjoy themselves , but there are those who as they get older , thirteen , fourteen or fifteen go a little bit beyond the pale , " he said .
" they 're the ones we will be cracking down hard on and that sort of behaviour can be knocking and running away from doors , ringing doorbells and running away . "

experts at cannock chase suspected last year that the welsh clearwing moth , not seen on the chase since 1922 , may be back .
it is now thought the chase could be home to the uk 's largest colony .
the moth 's revival could be down to efforts to remove bracken and encourage wildlife back to the area .
the welsh clearwing has always been rare in the uk , only occurring in small parts of wales , scotland and ireland in recent years .
as a result people had stopped looking for it in staffordshire .
experts from the butterfly conservation trust and staffordshire county council got together to record sightings of the moth and recorded 219 adults in two days .
a spokesman said : " it 's testament to the incredible hard work put into the regeneration of the unique heathland habitat by the council 's professional team of wildlife experts and the dedication of the band of volunteers . "
