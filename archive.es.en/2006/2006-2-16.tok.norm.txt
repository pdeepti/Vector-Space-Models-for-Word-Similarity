european lawmakers approved a hotly contested plan to open the bloc 's vast service sector thursday .
the plan enjoys the support of the eu 's two largest parties , but some smaller groups are unhappy with the deal . the proposed directive , which the european commission originally put on the table in 2004 , aims to create a european service market free of most administrative and political obstacles currently holding back service providers from setting up shop in other member states .
supporters also hope it will generate much-needed jobs in the 25-nation bloc . " we can now move on to focus on the delivery of real economic benefits for consumers and companies , " said eurodeputy malcom harbour , who worked on the text on behalf of the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , the biggest political group in the parliament . the services sector is responsible for half the economic activity in the eu and 60 percent of its jobs .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said reforms are essential for spurring employment and growth in europe 's long-flagging economy . the directive , which still needs to be approved by the european commission and member states , would cover any service not explicitly excluded or covered by other eu-wide legislation .
catering , advertising , architects , the construction industry , accountants , hairdressing and the computer industry would all be covered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when they finish , these students could offer their services across europe the epp and the socialists , the parliament 's two largest parties , agreed health care and social services such as social housing and childcare would be excluded as well as services like education that are provided directly by the state . in order to reach a compromise before thursday 's vote , the parties watered down the proposal to allow member states to bar service providers for a number of reasons , provided the intervention is non-discriminatory . companies to follow host nation 's laws " what we 've got now is a directive which very clearly will promote opening markets , reduce red tape and facilitate cooperation , " german social democrat evelyne gebhardt told journalists .
" at the same time , i think it takes account of the rights of workers and consumers . " the deal , which passed by a 394-215 margin , will allow companies to provide their services across the eu , but require them to adhere to the labor , health , safety and environmental standards of the host country .
previous versions of the bill , which allowed companies to follow the standards of their home country , met with stiff resistance . the bill 's opponents , including germany , france and austria , fear an influx of cheap labor - epitomized by " polish plumbers " willing to work longer for less pay - would undercut local competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child care is one of the services the compromise would not open changes needed to push competition free market supporters , such as britain and the eu 's new east european member states , have said the directive is necessary to increase competition across the union . the agreed upon proposal , however , is too weak for some proponents .
epp vice-president and hungarian parliamentarian józsef szájer wrote in wednesday 's financial times that he thought a majority for a broader proposal could still be found and called on lawmakers to vote against the compromise . " if the number and extent of excuses for states to control service providers from other member states grows beyond the present situation , the original rationale of the draft directive is lost , " he wrote .
" if the text ends up according to last week 's compromise , it is better to vote against it , than support a directive that creates new obstacles and freezes europe 's services market for 30 more years . " the eu parliament was eager to produce a broad majority so that member states , who are themselves deeply divided on the issue , will not be tempted to veer from its text when it is the governments ' turn to look at the package . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to put service sector reform to the test plans to throw open europe 's vast services sector to tougher competition faces a crunch week as the european parliament prepares to vote on hotly contested new legislation .

dr. stefanie ritz-timme of the institute for forensic medicine in düsseldorf helped create the software and said it is the first of its kind . scientists and police hope to refine the software enough to be able to scan the massive amounts of image data that investigators routinely confiscate .
the software would automatically filter out images of children from older people , thereby relieving police of having to do the job manually .
the german criminal police office is collaborating with the team of forensic scientists and anthropologists - from germany , italy and lithuania - in the further development of the program .
the european union is also sponsoring the project with one million euros . the program is fast to spot a child bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric scanner identifies facial features the program currently requires just two minutes to classify an image of a face by age .
when the software scans an image databank , it can weed out illegal child pornography from permitted adult pornography found on the internet . for the specialized software to work , facial patterns must first be " logged " into the program .
the research team thus photographed the faces of 600 german , italian and lithuanian children and entered their facial characteristics into the program .
the researchers intend to photograph another 1,650 children and young people to enhance the software 's detection capabilities . different types of software help police trace victims while the computer program 's ability to pinpoint facial characteristics specific to children is new , computer software to hunt down child porn traffickers is not .
in september 2005 , the international criminal police organization interpol announced it would launch a major campaign to identify child sex victims and prosecute abusers with the help of special software . the software is supposed to minutely analyze pornographic material on the internet and spot key background clues .
according to reuters news agency , hamish mcculloch - an interpol official - said police around the world would have access to the technology and image database . " currently , investigations tend to focus on trying to seize computers , forensically examine the hard drive and obtain the evidence to prosecute for possession or distribution -lrb- of child pornography -rrb- , " mcculloch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet pornography is easily accessible but the efforts are often in vain as many countries have n't pushed for identifying and prosecuting child sex abusers .
therefore , the focus must be on identifying the victims , mcculloch said . " once you 've identified the victim , you 've identified the abuser .
the vast majority is identified through the victims , " he said .
interpol has built up a databank of hundreds of thousands of images of child porn victims and as a result has managed to rescue at least several hundred children . analyzing crime scenes leads to finding victims the specialized software , however , not only helps to identify victims , but also crime scenes .
in one famous case , interpol analyzed the photo of a young girl found on a computer in the united states and linked it to four pictures from belgium .
the software was able to determine that the four different children shown separately had been photographed in the same room because it had recognized the wallpaper pattern in the background .
investigators eventually traced the victims and found the abuser . according to the international children 's watchdog agency ecpat , based in bangkok , most child pornography is exchanged for free online .
however , it has also sparked an underground business worth billions of dollars that distributes millions of images of child sex abuse . despite the new detection software , police are hard-pressed to keep up with other technological developments .
digital cameras , web sites and e-mail make it easy for computer users to circulate any images they want . ecpat says half of the images of child abuse sold online come from the united states , and another quarter comes from russia .
the agency is calling for tougher laws that would require internet providers to monitor for sexual photos of children . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vast police probe pursues child porn police across europe swooped down on dozens of locations and arrested more than 20 suspects in a vast operation against an online child pornography network , the largest of its kind coordinated by europol .

dr. stefanie ritz-timme of the institute for forensic medicine in düsseldorf helped create the software and said it is the first of its kind . scientists and police hope to refine the software enough to be able to scan the massive amounts of image data that investigators routinely confiscate .
the software would automatically filter out images of children from older people , thereby relieving police of having to do the job manually .
the german criminal police office is collaborating with the team of forensic scientists and anthropologists - from germany , italy and lithuania - in the further development of the program .
the european union is also sponsoring the project with one million euros . the program is fast to spot a child bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric scanner identifies facial features the program currently requires just two minutes to classify an image of a face by age .
when the software scans an image databank , it can weed out illegal child pornography from permitted adult pornography found on the internet . for the specialized software to work , facial patterns must first be " logged " into the program .
the research team thus photographed the faces of 600 german , italian and lithuanian children and entered their facial characteristics into the program .
the researchers intend to photograph another 1,650 children and young people to enhance the software 's detection capabilities . different types of software help police trace victims while the computer program 's ability to pinpoint facial characteristics specific to children is new , computer software to hunt down child porn traffickers is not .
in september 2005 , the international criminal police organization interpol announced it would launch a major campaign to identify child sex victims and prosecute abusers with the help of special software . the software is supposed to minutely analyze pornographic material on the internet and spot key background clues .
according to reuters news agency , hamish mcculloch - an interpol official - said police around the world would have access to the technology and image database . " currently , investigations tend to focus on trying to seize computers , forensically examine the hard drive and obtain the evidence to prosecute for possession or distribution -lrb- of child pornography -rrb- , " mcculloch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet pornography is easily accessible but the efforts are often in vain as many countries have n't pushed for identifying and prosecuting child sex abusers .
therefore , the focus must be on identifying the victims , mcculloch said . " once you 've identified the victim , you 've identified the abuser .
the vast majority is identified through the victims , " he said .
interpol has built up a databank of hundreds of thousands of images of child porn victims and as a result has managed to rescue at least several hundred children . analyzing crime scenes leads to finding victims the specialized software , however , not only helps to identify victims , but also crime scenes .
in one famous case , interpol analyzed the photo of a young girl found on a computer in the united states and linked it to four pictures from belgium .
the software was able to determine that the four different children shown separately had been photographed in the same room because it had recognized the wallpaper pattern in the background .
investigators eventually traced the victims and found the abuser . according to the international children 's watchdog agency ecpat , based in bangkok , most child pornography is exchanged for free online .
however , it has also sparked an underground business worth billions of dollars that distributes millions of images of child sex abuse . despite the new detection software , police are hard-pressed to keep up with other technological developments .
digital cameras , web sites and e-mail make it easy for computer users to circulate any images they want . ecpat says half of the images of child abuse sold online come from the united states , and another quarter comes from russia .
the agency is calling for tougher laws that would require internet providers to monitor for sexual photos of children . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vast police probe pursues child porn police across europe swooped down on dozens of locations and arrested more than 20 suspects in a vast operation against an online child pornography network , the largest of its kind coordinated by europol .

the director says he is emphasizing loneliness , not rape , in the picture . " der freie wille , " or " the free will , " is the second entry in this year 's main competition to deal with the issue of rape .
the bosnian picture " grbavica " has also focused on the topic . a 15-minute scene showing a rape in horrifying detail forms the centerpiece of the german movie screened at the berlinale earlier this week . there will be few scenes committed to film this year more harrowing than the assault of a young woman on a windswept beach which explains how the main figure , theo , comes to serve more than nine years in a secure psychiatric unit . film focuses on an individual jürgen vogel , one of germany 's top actors and better known for comic roles , plays the convicted rapist theo .
he attempts to escape from the terrible longing within him and build a life with an unsuspecting girlfriend , nettie , portrayed by sabine timoteo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress sabine timoteo gives the harsh film a gentle side , says the director the plot skips straight to his life after detention , and his meeting with nettie .
she has suffered years of mental abuse from her divorced father . the blossoming relationship between theo and nettie , which is eventually consumed by his past , are the main subject matter of the 163-minute-long movie . " it is not a film about rape , it is about an individual , " director matthias glasner told a press conference after the screening earlier this week .
" i did n't want to show the treatment for a rapist , which is why there are no scenes of the therapy .
i wanted to show how life is for a rapist , what they feel . " glasner said he had shown the film to a girlfriend who had been raped . " at first , she did n't want to see it .
but when she did , she said it had removed the horror of the experience for her , " glasner said to a howl of objection from one of the assembled journalists . a film which courts controversy the brutality of the rape scenes means the film courts controversy - making it perfect for a festival that prides itself on grappling with issues others wo n't touch .
it relies on timoteo for any gentleness . " i have to say that i felt a lot of resistance to the plot to begin with , " timoteo said .
" my biggest challenge was to let that angst go . " " the free will " is one of four german-made films in competition , along with " longing " -lrb- " sehnsucht " -rrb- , " elementary particles " -lrb- " elementarteilchen " -rrb- and " requiem .

"
european indie films are top of the shopping lists the movie stars , the gliterring premieres ... it 's the public face of the berlinale film festival .
but behind the scenes , the hard bargaining happens .
this year , the must-have item for distributors is edgy european cinema . for ten days in february , paparazzi and film fans alike take over marlene dietrich platz in downtown berlin .
the reason ?
berlinale - germany ’ s largest international film festival .
with 400 movies , the first of europe 's three major film festivals is bigger than ever , showing everything from hollywood blockbusters to art house debuts from lesser-known artists . but what has grown most in recent years is the berlinale 's european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- .
since competitor mifed stopped operating in milan , italy , last autumn and the american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moved from april to november , the european film market has become one of the most important events on the industry calendar . it 's the only market worldwide which takes place within the framework of a film-festival .
and among the world ’ s biggest international film festivals , the berlinale is unique .
it 's not just for invited guests and professionals , but is also open to the public . in the berlinale 's 30 cinemas , world premieres test a film ’ s potential success with critics and an international audience alike .
on tuesday , iranian director rafi pitts screened his new film " zemestan – it 's winter " which is competing for the berlinale 's golden bear prize this year . " for any film - whether iranian or not - a podium like berlin obviously is beautiful , " pitts said .
" because it helps art exist .
if you work in art house cinema , how else are you going to get people to find out about it ?
how else are you going to give that podium for smaller distributors to be helped and they release it .
so it 's a question to tell the world that the film exists . " the place to pick up quality european indies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european indies are drawing in the crowds at berlinale this year although hollywood blockbusters are also featured in berlin , their distribution and public relations deals were made long ago as part of their financing .
in berlin , the berlinale 's six sections mainly focus on art house cinema . and it 's at the european film market that the independent scene 's new releases are promoted and international distribution rights are negotiated . " this year we have a selection of 625 films coming from i think 48 countries , " said efm-director beki probst .
" we have a lot of american independents ; we are still going on with the straight-from-sundance program .
we have , of course , a lot of european films , also of course german films .
and we do have a lot of films from asia . " the efm is a real chance for independent films to find a wider audience .
edgy german competition-entry " elementary particles " became a market hit last week .
distributor celluloid dreams sold the adaptation of michel houellebecq 's book to distributors in 23 countries – all within 24 hours of the film 's berlinale debut . german films , actors and directors in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german film " elementary particles " has made a big splash " i think that there 's really something spectacular happening with the german cinema at the moment , " enthused beki probst .
such resurgence is good news for the german box office which is sorely in need of a boost .
like most of europe , cinema admissions were down last year in germany to 21.5 million , a slump from the 36.7 million of the previous year . but this year , traders are paying particular attention to new german actors , young directors and their films .
the diversity in style and content has never been broader .

" if we want to promote european films and make sure the 1.5 billion euros spent on supporting european films are used correctly , we should use funding more effectively , " the institute said . european film makers are hoping that the discussions find a way to better support their products and to allow artists to bring their visions to life and to the market place at places like the berlinale . peter zimmermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale applauds german film about rapist a film about a rapist 's attempts to escape his past at the berlinale upholds the film festival 's reputation for dealing with wrenching subjects .

he attempts to escape from the terrible longing within him and build a life with an unsuspecting girlfriend , nettie , portrayed by sabine timoteo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress sabine timoteo gives the harsh film a gentle side , says the director the plot skips straight to his life after detention , and his meeting with nettie .
she has suffered years of mental abuse from her divorced father . the blossoming relationship between theo and nettie , which is eventually consumed by his past , are the main subject matter of the 163-minute-long movie . " it is not a film about rape , it is about an individual , " director matthias glasner told a press conference after the screening earlier this week .
" i did n't want to show the treatment for a rapist , which is why there are no scenes of the therapy .
i wanted to show how life is for a rapist , what they feel . " glasner said he had shown the film to a girlfriend who had been raped . " at first , she did n't want to see it .
but when she did , she said it had removed the horror of the experience for her , " glasner said to a howl of objection from one of the assembled journalists . a film which courts controversy the brutality of the rape scenes means the film courts controversy - making it perfect for a festival that prides itself on grappling with issues others wo n't touch .
it relies on timoteo for any gentleness . " i have to say that i felt a lot of resistance to the plot to begin with , " timoteo said .
" my biggest challenge was to let that angst go . " " the free will " is one of four german-made films in competition , along with " longing " -lrb- " sehnsucht " -rrb- , " elementary particles " -lrb- " elementarteilchen " -rrb- and " requiem .

"
european indie films are top of the shopping lists the movie stars , the gliterring premieres ... it 's the public face of the berlinale film festival .
but behind the scenes , the hard bargaining happens .
this year , the must-have item for distributors is edgy european cinema . for ten days in february , paparazzi and film fans alike take over marlene dietrich platz in downtown berlin .
the reason ?
berlinale - germany ’ s largest international film festival .
with 400 movies , the first of europe 's three major film festivals is bigger than ever , showing everything from hollywood blockbusters to art house debuts from lesser-known artists . but what has grown most in recent years is the berlinale 's european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- .
since competitor mifed stopped operating in milan , italy , last autumn and the american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moved from april to november , the european film market has become one of the most important events on the industry calendar . it 's the only market worldwide which takes place within the framework of a film-festival .
and among the world ’ s biggest international film festivals , the berlinale is unique .
it 's not just for invited guests and professionals , but is also open to the public . in the berlinale 's 30 cinemas , world premieres test a film ’ s potential success with critics and an international audience alike .
on tuesday , iranian director rafi pitts screened his new film " zemestan – it 's winter " which is competing for the berlinale 's golden bear prize this year . " for any film - whether iranian or not - a podium like berlin obviously is beautiful , " pitts said .
" because it helps art exist .
if you work in art house cinema , how else are you going to get people to find out about it ?
how else are you going to give that podium for smaller distributors to be helped and they release it .
so it 's a question to tell the world that the film exists . " the place to pick up quality european indies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european indies are drawing in the crowds at berlinale this year although hollywood blockbusters are also featured in berlin , their distribution and public relations deals were made long ago as part of their financing .
in berlin , the berlinale 's six sections mainly focus on art house cinema . and it 's at the european film market that the independent scene 's new releases are promoted and international distribution rights are negotiated . " this year we have a selection of 625 films coming from i think 48 countries , " said efm-director beki probst .
" we have a lot of american independents ; we are still going on with the straight-from-sundance program .
we have , of course , a lot of european films , also of course german films .
and we do have a lot of films from asia . " the efm is a real chance for independent films to find a wider audience .
edgy german competition-entry " elementary particles " became a market hit last week .
distributor celluloid dreams sold the adaptation of michel houellebecq 's book to distributors in 23 countries – all within 24 hours of the film 's berlinale debut . german films , actors and directors in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german film " elementary particles " has made a big splash " i think that there 's really something spectacular happening with the german cinema at the moment , " enthused beki probst .
such resurgence is good news for the german box office which is sorely in need of a boost .
like most of europe , cinema admissions were down last year in germany to 21.5 million , a slump from the 36.7 million of the previous year . but this year , traders are paying particular attention to new german actors , young directors and their films .
the diversity in style and content has never been broader .
this year 's berlinale is showcasing 55 local films in all , including four in the festival 's main competition . europe looks to the future with funding initiative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of european films will hopefully boost ticket sales in 2006 with more than 700 films now being produced each year in europe , a new think tank was launched at the european film market this week by the danish film institute .
" if we want to promote european films and make sure the 1.5 billion euros spent on supporting european films are used correctly , we should use funding more effectively , " the institute said . european film makers are hoping that the discussions find a way to better support their products and to allow artists to bring their visions to life and to the market place at places like the berlinale . peter zimmermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale applauds german film about rapist a film about a rapist 's attempts to escape his past at the berlinale upholds the film festival 's reputation for dealing with wrenching subjects .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.02.2006 eu approves service sector reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will tilers soon be able to work in any eu country they choose ?
european lawmakers approved a hotly contested plan to open the bloc 's vast service sector thursday .
the plan enjoys the support of the eu 's two largest parties , but some smaller groups are unhappy with the deal . the proposed directive , which the european commission originally put on the table in 2004 , aims to create a european service market free of most administrative and political obstacles currently holding back service providers from setting up shop in other member states .
supporters also hope it will generate much-needed jobs in the 25-nation bloc . " we can now move on to focus on the delivery of real economic benefits for consumers and companies , " said eurodeputy malcom harbour , who worked on the text on behalf of the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , the biggest political group in the parliament . the services sector is responsible for half the economic activity in the eu and 60 percent of its jobs .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said reforms are essential for spurring employment and growth in europe 's long-flagging economy . the directive , which still needs to be approved by the european commission and member states , would cover any service not explicitly excluded or covered by other eu-wide legislation .
catering , advertising , architects , the construction industry , accountants , hairdressing and the computer industry would all be covered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when they finish , these students could offer their services across europe the epp and the socialists , the parliament 's two largest parties , agreed health care and social services such as social housing and childcare would be excluded as well as services like education that are provided directly by the state . in order to reach a compromise before thursday 's vote , the parties watered down the proposal to allow member states to bar service providers for a number of reasons , provided the intervention is non-discriminatory . companies to follow host nation 's laws " what we 've got now is a directive which very clearly will promote opening markets , reduce red tape and facilitate cooperation , " german social democrat evelyne gebhardt told journalists .
" at the same time , i think it takes account of the rights of workers and consumers . " the deal , which passed by a 394-215 margin , will allow companies to provide their services across the eu , but require them to adhere to the labor , health , safety and environmental standards of the host country .
previous versions of the bill , which allowed companies to follow the standards of their home country , met with stiff resistance . the bill 's opponents , including germany , france and austria , fear an influx of cheap labor - epitomized by " polish plumbers " willing to work longer for less pay - would undercut local competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child care is one of the services the compromise would not open changes needed to push competition free market supporters , such as britain and the eu 's new east european member states , have said the directive is necessary to increase competition across the union . the agreed upon proposal , however , is too weak for some proponents .
epp vice-president and hungarian parliamentarian józsef szájer wrote in wednesday 's financial times that he thought a majority for a broader proposal could still be found and called on lawmakers to vote against the compromise . " if the number and extent of excuses for states to control service providers from other member states grows beyond the present situation , the original rationale of the draft directive is lost , " he wrote .
" if the text ends up according to last week 's compromise , it is better to vote against it , than support a directive that creates new obstacles and freezes europe 's services market for 30 more years . " the eu parliament was eager to produce a broad majority so that member states , who are themselves deeply divided on the issue , will not be tempted to veer from its text when it is the governments ' turn to look at the package . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to put service sector reform to the test plans to throw open europe 's vast services sector to tougher competition faces a crunch week as the european parliament prepares to vote on hotly contested new legislation .

" -lrb- wednesday 's -rrb- decision ... was taken in light of the rapid spread of avian influenza over the past months and the current high risk of the disease spreading further , " said the european commission in a statement . so far , the h5n1 virus - which in its highly pathogenic form can be fatal to humans - has been detected within europe in austria , bulgaria , croatia , germany , greece , italy , romania , slovenia and ukraine . health commissioner marko kyprianou , attending the two days of talks with health experts from eu member states , underlined that there is unlikely to be an early end to the cases of bird flu . " given that the spring migration will begin soon we will review again the situation to see if there 's need for additional methods ...
we should n't be surprised if we have more migratory wild birds with this virus , " he said . " there 's no need to panic , " he warned .
" we have to advise the european public to stay calm ... there 's no reason not to consume chicken . " the potentially lethal h5n1 strain has killed at least 90 people - almost half those who caught it - mostly in southeast asia and china where it first erupted but also in turkey and northern iraq . eu fears transmission of virus into human food chain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission said that the consumption of chicken is not a threat , at the moment the big fear in the eu - which is the world 's third biggest exporter of poultry after the united states and brazil - is that the virus passes from migratory swans to chickens , or other birds in the human food chain . the avian virus , first reported on europe 's southeastern flanks in early january , re-erupted with a vengeance last week , starting in italy and greece but now with almost daily cases in a string of european countries . in germany , authorities wednesday set up the now-standard 10-kilometer -lrb- six-mile -rrb- surveillance zone around the site where the dead wild swans were found on the island of rügen in the baltic sea . hours later hungary confirmed that it had detected the h5-type virus in the bodies of three dead swans in the south of the country . bloc admits it is powerless to stop the disease arriving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nothing can be done to prevent migratory birds landing in europe as the eu scrambles , some underline that there is basically little it can do to prevent the disease arriving .
" we have absolutely no control over the introduction of the virus by migratory birds that are about to start returning from africa to siberia , scandinavia and greenland , " said french food safety agency panelist jean hars .
" it is unavoidable , " he told reporters . until recently , the eu has said it is satisfied that the measures taken are sufficient . but brussels is closely monitoring the situation and if poultry should become infected , it may call for the culling of all birds and eggs on small holdings or farms .
in addition the european commission has proposed speeding up the process of clamping down on new outbreaks , by making arrangements automatic rather than on a case-by-case basis . experts assess " minimum risk " to poultry flocks meanwhile , health experts said wednesday that migrant birds carrying the virus appear to pose only a limited risk to western europe 's poultry flocks . in contrast to asia and africa , where chickens , ducks and geese raised for the pot are generally grown in open fields and farmyards , most of the european union 's poultry spends its life in large , enclosed sheds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized farms stand a good chance of remianing virus-free " migrating birds do not come into contact with fowl in these industrialized farms , so this is reassuring , " said jeanne brugere-picoux , a professor at the alfort veterinary school near paris and a pathologist in bird diseases .
" but precautions still have to be taken .
migrating birds are a risk , although the risk is more specifically for farmyard fowl which live out in the open and for domestic ducks , " she said . julian hughes , head of species conservation at the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- in britain , said the biggest potential source of transmission was in ponds , lakes or wetlands .
" the virus can be transmitted through a variety of ways , " he told reporters . " we know that the virus stays active within feces and in water for several days after it 's been shed from the bird .
but another route which is just as likely is direct contact , through nasal and bodily fluids , through the bill or the nose . ” " ducks and geese congregate in large numbers , thousands of them together .
they all feed together and when they roost at night , they tend to roost together in the middle of the water , so they are in pretty close contact . " spread attributed in part to movement of diseased poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range diseased poultry pose just as much threat as migratory birds hughes said it was quite possible that migrating birds could pick up the virus from infected poultry , rather than the other way round .
and he called for a sense of proportion , noting that outbreaks of bird flu were chiefly caused by the movement of diseased poultry , not wildlife . " the danger is that if everyone talks and concentrates on migratory birds , then bio-security measures get neglected , " he said . trying to stamp out h5n1 in wild birds through culls " is going to be entirely ineffective , because there are millions of birds on the move , " he said .
" but you can do something about bio-security in the poultry sector .

in addition the european commission has proposed speeding up the process of clamping down on new outbreaks , by making arrangements automatic rather than on a case-by-case basis . experts assess " minimum risk " to poultry flocks meanwhile , health experts said wednesday that migrant birds carrying the virus appear to pose only a limited risk to western europe 's poultry flocks . in contrast to asia and africa , where chickens , ducks and geese raised for the pot are generally grown in open fields and farmyards , most of the european union 's poultry spends its life in large , enclosed sheds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized farms stand a good chance of remianing virus-free " migrating birds do not come into contact with fowl in these industrialized farms , so this is reassuring , " said jeanne brugere-picoux , a professor at the alfort veterinary school near paris and a pathologist in bird diseases .
" but precautions still have to be taken .
migrating birds are a risk , although the risk is more specifically for farmyard fowl which live out in the open and for domestic ducks , " she said . julian hughes , head of species conservation at the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- in britain , said the biggest potential source of transmission was in ponds , lakes or wetlands .
" the virus can be transmitted through a variety of ways , " he told reporters . " we know that the virus stays active within feces and in water for several days after it 's been shed from the bird .
but another route which is just as likely is direct contact , through nasal and bodily fluids , through the bill or the nose . ” " ducks and geese congregate in large numbers , thousands of them together .
they all feed together and when they roost at night , they tend to roost together in the middle of the water , so they are in pretty close contact . " spread attributed in part to movement of diseased poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range diseased poultry pose just as much threat as migratory birds hughes said it was quite possible that migrating birds could pick up the virus from infected poultry , rather than the other way round .
and he called for a sense of proportion , noting that outbreaks of bird flu were chiefly caused by the movement of diseased poultry , not wildlife . " the danger is that if everyone talks and concentrates on migratory birds , then bio-security measures get neglected , " he said . trying to stamp out h5n1 in wild birds through culls " is going to be entirely ineffective , because there are millions of birds on the move , " he said .

" -lrb- wednesday 's -rrb- decision ... was taken in light of the rapid spread of avian influenza over the past months and the current high risk of the disease spreading further , " said the european commission in a statement . so far , the h5n1 virus - which in its highly pathogenic form can be fatal to humans - has been detected within europe in austria , bulgaria , croatia , germany , greece , italy , romania , slovenia and ukraine . health commissioner marko kyprianou , attending the two days of talks with health experts from eu member states , underlined that there is unlikely to be an early end to the cases of bird flu . " given that the spring migration will begin soon we will review again the situation to see if there 's need for additional methods ...
we should n't be surprised if we have more migratory wild birds with this virus , " he said . " there 's no need to panic , " he warned .
" we have to advise the european public to stay calm ... there 's no reason not to consume chicken . " the potentially lethal h5n1 strain has killed at least 90 people - almost half those who caught it - mostly in southeast asia and china where it first erupted but also in turkey and northern iraq . eu fears transmission of virus into human food chain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission said that the consumption of chicken is not a threat , at the moment the big fear in the eu - which is the world 's third biggest exporter of poultry after the united states and brazil - is that the virus passes from migratory swans to chickens , or other birds in the human food chain . the avian virus , first reported on europe 's southeastern flanks in early january , re-erupted with a vengeance last week , starting in italy and greece but now with almost daily cases in a string of european countries . in germany , authorities wednesday set up the now-standard 10-kilometer -lrb- six-mile -rrb- surveillance zone around the site where the dead wild swans were found on the island of rügen in the baltic sea . hours later hungary confirmed that it had detected the h5-type virus in the bodies of three dead swans in the south of the country . bloc admits it is powerless to stop the disease arriving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nothing can be done to prevent migratory birds landing in europe as the eu scrambles , some underline that there is basically little it can do to prevent the disease arriving .
" we have absolutely no control over the introduction of the virus by migratory birds that are about to start returning from africa to siberia , scandinavia and greenland , " said french food safety agency panelist jean hars .
" it is unavoidable , " he told reporters . until recently , the eu has said it is satisfied that the measures taken are sufficient . but brussels is closely monitoring the situation and if poultry should become infected , it may call for the culling of all birds and eggs on small holdings or farms .
in addition the european commission has proposed speeding up the process of clamping down on new outbreaks , by making arrangements automatic rather than on a case-by-case basis . experts assess " minimum risk " to poultry flocks meanwhile , health experts said wednesday that migrant birds carrying the virus appear to pose only a limited risk to western europe 's poultry flocks . in contrast to asia and africa , where chickens , ducks and geese raised for the pot are generally grown in open fields and farmyards , most of the european union 's poultry spends its life in large , enclosed sheds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized farms stand a good chance of remianing virus-free " migrating birds do not come into contact with fowl in these industrialized farms , so this is reassuring , " said jeanne brugere-picoux , a professor at the alfort veterinary school near paris and a pathologist in bird diseases .
" but precautions still have to be taken .
migrating birds are a risk , although the risk is more specifically for farmyard fowl which live out in the open and for domestic ducks , " she said . julian hughes , head of species conservation at the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- in britain , said the biggest potential source of transmission was in ponds , lakes or wetlands .
" the virus can be transmitted through a variety of ways , " he told reporters . " we know that the virus stays active within feces and in water for several days after it 's been shed from the bird .
but another route which is just as likely is direct contact , through nasal and bodily fluids , through the bill or the nose . ” " ducks and geese congregate in large numbers , thousands of them together .
they all feed together and when they roost at night , they tend to roost together in the middle of the water , so they are in pretty close contact . " spread attributed in part to movement of diseased poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range diseased poultry pose just as much threat as migratory birds hughes said it was quite possible that migrating birds could pick up the virus from infected poultry , rather than the other way round .
and he called for a sense of proportion , noting that outbreaks of bird flu were chiefly caused by the movement of diseased poultry , not wildlife . " the danger is that if everyone talks and concentrates on migratory birds , then bio-security measures get neglected , " he said . trying to stamp out h5n1 in wild birds through culls " is going to be entirely ineffective , because there are millions of birds on the move , " he said .

" it is a sub-type of h5n1 , which first appeared among poultry in china last year , " seehofer said in a speech carried on german television .
" even with the most rigorous action we can not assume that we will overcome this matter in a few weeks .

17 after the ministry had changed the date to feb .
20 from march 1 only hours before . the rural northern state of mecklenburg-vorpommern , where the infected swans were found , would be the first area to feel the immediate effect of the ban . the state was left reeling after a further 40 dead swans were found near the area where the first cases were found . seehofer urged the german public to remain calm and reiterated the opinion of health experts by saying that there was no evidence the disease could yet be spread from human to human , although a mutation in the virus could make this possible if someone suffering from human flu contracts the disease . migrating birds mixing with poultry a big risk the minister pointed to a heightened risk of the virus spreading across europe as migrating birds start returning to the continent .
" the return of migrating birds poses a big risk , " he said , adding that the top priority must be given to preventing bird flu spreading to farm animals , especially poultry bred for consumption . " we are dealing with a dangerous animal disease which also has potential danger to humans , " he said .
" the risk of the disease being spread by migrating birds must be regarded as considerably higher than previously .
it is essential that we prevent the disease being transmitted from wild birds to domestic poultry . " outbreaks of bird flu have now been recorded along the main migration routes . seehofer confirmed that a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- protection area had been set up around the island off northern germany where the dead swans were found .
a larger 10-kilometre surveillance zone is also in place around rügen , which lies 50 kilometers from northwestern poland . casual approach to dead swans criticized by politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dead swans remained untouched as state authorities dithered the mecklenburg-vorpommern authorities have been heavily criticized by a number of prominent german politicians for their casual reaction to the discovery of the dead birds . scenes of the dead swans lying over an expanse of beach showed little or no activity from state officials .
there was a distinct lack of anyone attempting to clear away the corpses or examine them in order to find the causes of their deaths . in response to the criticism , mecklenburg-vorpommern state environment and farm minister till backhaus admitted there had been some problems but blamed germany 's federal system for tying the hands of the state . under the federal system , local district councils had responsibility to collect and test dead birds and state authorities had no power to act . backhaus did add that he had been in contact with local councils and expected more rapid action . death toll yet to include eu victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : measures are being taken in europe to prevent the virus affecting the human population bird flu has already killed at least 90 people - almost half those who caught it - mostly in southeast asia and china where it first erupted but also in the asian part of turkey and northern iraq . in europe , the presence of the h5n1 virus has been confirmed in bulgaria , romania , greece , austria , italy , germany and the european part of russia . hungary , croatia , slovenia and ukraine are among countries investigating possible outbreaks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global infections and human cost here is a country-by-country breakdown of confirmed cases of avian flu in humans , as reported by the united nations world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- .

" it is a sub-type of h5n1 , which first appeared among poultry in china last year , " seehofer said in a speech carried on german television .
" even with the most rigorous action we can not assume that we will overcome this matter in a few weeks . " " given the worldwide spread of this virus , we are expecting more cases in germany , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer urged citizens to remain calm in the face of the outbreak seehofer 's agriculture ministry issued a ban on keeping poultry out of doors on wednesday , bringing the action forward to feb .
17 after the ministry had changed the date to feb .
20 from march 1 only hours before . the rural northern state of mecklenburg-vorpommern , where the infected swans were found , would be the first area to feel the immediate effect of the ban . the state was left reeling after a further 40 dead swans were found near the area where the first cases were found . seehofer urged the german public to remain calm and reiterated the opinion of health experts by saying that there was no evidence the disease could yet be spread from human to human , although a mutation in the virus could make this possible if someone suffering from human flu contracts the disease . migrating birds mixing with poultry a big risk the minister pointed to a heightened risk of the virus spreading across europe as migrating birds start returning to the continent .
" the return of migrating birds poses a big risk , " he said , adding that the top priority must be given to preventing bird flu spreading to farm animals , especially poultry bred for consumption . " we are dealing with a dangerous animal disease which also has potential danger to humans , " he said .
" the risk of the disease being spread by migrating birds must be regarded as considerably higher than previously .
it is essential that we prevent the disease being transmitted from wild birds to domestic poultry .

dr. stefanie ritz-timme of the institute for forensic medicine in düsseldorf helped create the software and said it is the first of its kind . scientists and police hope to refine the software enough to be able to scan the massive amounts of image data that investigators routinely confiscate .
the software would automatically filter out images of children from older people , thereby relieving police of having to do the job manually .
the german criminal police office is collaborating with the team of forensic scientists and anthropologists - from germany , italy and lithuania - in the further development of the program .
the european union is also sponsoring the project with one million euros . the program is fast to spot a child bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric scanner identifies facial features the program currently requires just two minutes to classify an image of a face by age .
when the software scans an image databank , it can weed out illegal child pornography from permitted adult pornography found on the internet . for the specialized software to work , facial patterns must first be " logged " into the program .
the research team thus photographed the faces of 600 german , italian and lithuanian children and entered their facial characteristics into the program .
the researchers intend to photograph another 1,650 children and young people to enhance the software 's detection capabilities . different types of software help police trace victims while the computer program 's ability to pinpoint facial characteristics specific to children is new , computer software to hunt down child porn traffickers is not .
in september 2005 , the international criminal police organization interpol announced it would launch a major campaign to identify child sex victims and prosecute abusers with the help of special software . the software is supposed to minutely analyze pornographic material on the internet and spot key background clues .
according to reuters news agency , hamish mcculloch - an interpol official - said police around the world would have access to the technology and image database . " currently , investigations tend to focus on trying to seize computers , forensically examine the hard drive and obtain the evidence to prosecute for possession or distribution -lrb- of child pornography -rrb- , " mcculloch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet pornography is easily accessible but the efforts are often in vain as many countries have n't pushed for identifying and prosecuting child sex abusers .
therefore , the focus must be on identifying the victims , mcculloch said . " once you 've identified the victim , you 've identified the abuser .
the vast majority is identified through the victims , " he said .
interpol has built up a databank of hundreds of thousands of images of child porn victims and as a result has managed to rescue at least several hundred children . analyzing crime scenes leads to finding victims the specialized software , however , not only helps to identify victims , but also crime scenes .
in one famous case , interpol analyzed the photo of a young girl found on a computer in the united states and linked it to four pictures from belgium .
the software was able to determine that the four different children shown separately had been photographed in the same room because it had recognized the wallpaper pattern in the background .
investigators eventually traced the victims and found the abuser . according to the international children 's watchdog agency ecpat , based in bangkok , most child pornography is exchanged for free online .
however , it has also sparked an underground business worth billions of dollars that distributes millions of images of child sex abuse . despite the new detection software , police are hard-pressed to keep up with other technological developments .
digital cameras , web sites and e-mail make it easy for computer users to circulate any images they want . ecpat says half of the images of child abuse sold online come from the united states , and another quarter comes from russia .
the agency is calling for tougher laws that would require internet providers to monitor for sexual photos of children . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vast police probe pursues child porn police across europe swooped down on dozens of locations and arrested more than 20 suspects in a vast operation against an online child pornography network , the largest of its kind coordinated by europol .

one german state has decided to heed the call . bavaria makes no bones about the importance of its cultural identity , in which local language plays a particularly important role .
it should , therefore , come as little surprise that the sprawling southern state should be the first to launch a targeted initiative to reignite regional passions for its spoken heritage now deemed to be threatened by extinction .
earlier this month , the bavarian culture ministry presented a grand plan to help prevent its dialects from falling prey to linguistic evolution and the long arm of globalization .
the idea is to provide schools , both primary and secondary , with teaching material which would facilitate the integration of local dialects into regular classes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linguistic snobbery should become a thing of the past harald niedermair , a spokesman for the culture ministry , said one of the main aims of the project is to stamp out the stigma which is still attached to being a dialect speaker .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how bavarian are they once they start to speak ?
dialectologist bernhard stör agreed it was important to encourage children to speak in dialect , but said the culture ministry 's proposals do n't get to the root of the problem .
" as long as the general public views local dialect as a negative thing , the ministerial guidelines for teachers are nothing short of ridiculous . "
he said that schools ca n't be expected to influence the situation unless 50 percent of teaching is conducted in dialect .
too much too soon stör said dialects have been fighting a losing battle since the 1960s , when it became fashionable for children to tone down their indigenous tongues to remove any obstructions along the path to learning the purer " high german " considered the key to a successful future .
" the general idea back then was that if children were having to learn both their dialect and german , they were being exposed to unnecessary confusion , " stör said .

although further out of town the numbers are a little higher , unless something is done to reverse the trend , it is only a matter of time before the city mentality reaches the countryside , he said .
too uncool for words " cities are always the linguistic frontrunners , " stör said , adding that the feeling among youngsters in munich is that dialect is simply uncool .

one german state has decided to heed the call . bavaria makes no bones about the importance of its cultural identity , in which local language plays a particularly important role .
it should , therefore , come as little surprise that the sprawling southern state should be the first to launch a targeted initiative to reignite regional passions for its spoken heritage now deemed to be threatened by extinction .
earlier this month , the bavarian culture ministry presented a grand plan to help prevent its dialects from falling prey to linguistic evolution and the long arm of globalization .
the idea is to provide schools , both primary and secondary , with teaching material which would facilitate the integration of local dialects into regular classes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linguistic snobbery should become a thing of the past harald niedermair , a spokesman for the culture ministry , said one of the main aims of the project is to stamp out the stigma which is still attached to being a dialect speaker .
" even today , there are people who view local dialects as an inferior means of communication .
we want to prevent a situation in which pupils are excluded simply because of the way they speak . "
dialect no deficit niedermair said the proposed model , which could incorporate local dialects into subjects as diverse as theater , geography , music and math , promotes the virtue in being able to speak a second language , even if one of them is restricted to a relatively small geographical area .
" we want to support children 's ability for bilingualism , to show that it is something positive rather than a deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how bavarian are they once they start to speak ?
dialectologist bernhard stör agreed it was important to encourage children to speak in dialect , but said the culture ministry 's proposals do n't get to the root of the problem .
" as long as the general public views local dialect as a negative thing , the ministerial guidelines for teachers are nothing short of ridiculous . "
he said that schools ca n't be expected to influence the situation unless 50 percent of teaching is conducted in dialect .
too much too soon stör said dialects have been fighting a losing battle since the 1960s , when it became fashionable for children to tone down their indigenous tongues to remove any obstructions along the path to learning the purer " high german " considered the key to a successful future .
" the general idea back then was that if children were having to learn both their dialect and german , they were being exposed to unnecessary confusion , " stör said .
but that belief has now been proven untrue .
" new research , however , shows that the sooner they start , the easier it is for children to absorb other languages in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich skyline that said , demographic evolution in bavaria has been such over the past decades that there are simply fewer dialect speakers to spread the word .
from the postwar era to the present day , the population of the bavarian capital , munich , has grown from half a million to almost 2.5 million inhabitants , but far from all of them can speak a local dialect .
" only four percent of greater munich residents under the age of 25 have so much as a passive understanding of the old bavarian dialect , " stör said .
although further out of town the numbers are a little higher , unless something is done to reverse the trend , it is only a matter of time before the city mentality reaches the countryside , he said .
too uncool for words " cities are always the linguistic frontrunners , " stör said , adding that the feeling among youngsters in munich is that dialect is simply uncool .
" children have absorbed the mentality of their parents , and often equate dialects with being dumb .
they think that if they want to get anywhere in their professional lives , they can not be seen to be speaking anything other than high german .

and therein lies the catch .
for , as things stand , it is easier to get a job in numerous branches , including tourism and media , if you do n't bring a thick accent along to the interview .
stör said the responsibility for changing that lies with those in the public eye .

one german state has decided to heed the call . bavaria makes no bones about the importance of its cultural identity , in which local language plays a particularly important role .
it should , therefore , come as little surprise that the sprawling southern state should be the first to launch a targeted initiative to reignite regional passions for its spoken heritage now deemed to be threatened by extinction .
earlier this month , the bavarian culture ministry presented a grand plan to help prevent its dialects from falling prey to linguistic evolution and the long arm of globalization .
the idea is to provide schools , both primary and secondary , with teaching material which would facilitate the integration of local dialects into regular classes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linguistic snobbery should become a thing of the past harald niedermair , a spokesman for the culture ministry , said one of the main aims of the project is to stamp out the stigma which is still attached to being a dialect speaker .
" even today , there are people who view local dialects as an inferior means of communication .
we want to prevent a situation in which pupils are excluded simply because of the way they speak . "
dialect no deficit niedermair said the proposed model , which could incorporate local dialects into subjects as diverse as theater , geography , music and math , promotes the virtue in being able to speak a second language , even if one of them is restricted to a relatively small geographical area .
" we want to support children 's ability for bilingualism , to show that it is something positive rather than a deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how bavarian are they once they start to speak ?
dialectologist bernhard stör agreed it was important to encourage children to speak in dialect , but said the culture ministry 's proposals do n't get to the root of the problem .
" as long as the general public views local dialect as a negative thing , the ministerial guidelines for teachers are nothing short of ridiculous . "
he said that schools ca n't be expected to influence the situation unless 50 percent of teaching is conducted in dialect .
too much too soon stör said dialects have been fighting a losing battle since the 1960s , when it became fashionable for children to tone down their indigenous tongues to remove any obstructions along the path to learning the purer " high german " considered the key to a successful future .
" the general idea back then was that if children were having to learn both their dialect and german , they were being exposed to unnecessary confusion , " stör said .
but that belief has now been proven untrue .
" new research , however , shows that the sooner they start , the easier it is for children to absorb other languages in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich skyline that said , demographic evolution in bavaria has been such over the past decades that there are simply fewer dialect speakers to spread the word .
from the postwar era to the present day , the population of the bavarian capital , munich , has grown from half a million to almost 2.5 million inhabitants , but far from all of them can speak a local dialect .
" only four percent of greater munich residents under the age of 25 have so much as a passive understanding of the old bavarian dialect , " stör said .
although further out of town the numbers are a little higher , unless something is done to reverse the trend , it is only a matter of time before the city mentality reaches the countryside , he said .
too uncool for words " cities are always the linguistic frontrunners , " stör said , adding that the feeling among youngsters in munich is that dialect is simply uncool .
" children have absorbed the mentality of their parents , and often equate dialects with being dumb .
they think that if they want to get anywhere in their professional lives , they can not be seen to be speaking anything other than high german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr bavarian , edmund stoiber ?
and therein lies the catch .
for , as things stand , it is easier to get a job in numerous branches , including tourism and media , if you do n't bring a thick accent along to the interview .
stör said the responsibility for changing that lies with those in the public eye .
he cited franz beckenbauer and edmund stoiber as personalities who could , simply by using their mother tongue , convince bavarians that they do n't have to give up on their linguistic heritage to stand a chance of leading a successful professional life inside or outside bavaria 's borders . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese etiquette lessons for germany china 's economic boom has triggered a burgeoning travel industry .

european lawmakers approved a hotly contested plan to open the bloc 's vast service sector thursday .
the plan enjoys the support of the eu 's two largest parties , but some smaller groups are unhappy with the deal . the proposed directive , which the european commission originally put on the table in 2004 , aims to create a european service market free of most administrative and political obstacles currently holding back service providers from setting up shop in other member states .
supporters also hope it will generate much-needed jobs in the 25-nation bloc . " we can now move on to focus on the delivery of real economic benefits for consumers and companies , " said eurodeputy malcom harbour , who worked on the text on behalf of the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , the biggest political group in the parliament . the services sector is responsible for half the economic activity in the eu and 60 percent of its jobs .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said reforms are essential for spurring employment and growth in europe 's long-flagging economy . the directive , which still needs to be approved by the european commission and member states , would cover any service not explicitly excluded or covered by other eu-wide legislation .
catering , advertising , architects , the construction industry , accountants , hairdressing and the computer industry would all be covered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when they finish , these students could offer their services across europe the epp and the socialists , the parliament 's two largest parties , agreed health care and social services such as social housing and childcare would be excluded as well as services like education that are provided directly by the state . in order to reach a compromise before thursday 's vote , the parties watered down the proposal to allow member states to bar service providers for a number of reasons , provided the intervention is non-discriminatory . companies to follow host nation 's laws " what we 've got now is a directive which very clearly will promote opening markets , reduce red tape and facilitate cooperation , " german social democrat evelyne gebhardt told journalists .
" at the same time , i think it takes account of the rights of workers and consumers . " the deal , which passed by a 394-215 margin , will allow companies to provide their services across the eu , but require them to adhere to the labor , health , safety and environmental standards of the host country .
previous versions of the bill , which allowed companies to follow the standards of their home country , met with stiff resistance . the bill 's opponents , including germany , france and austria , fear an influx of cheap labor - epitomized by " polish plumbers " willing to work longer for less pay - would undercut local competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child care is one of the services the compromise would not open changes needed to push competition free market supporters , such as britain and the eu 's new east european member states , have said the directive is necessary to increase competition across the union . the agreed upon proposal , however , is too weak for some proponents .
epp vice-president and hungarian parliamentarian józsef szájer wrote in wednesday 's financial times that he thought a majority for a broader proposal could still be found and called on lawmakers to vote against the compromise . " if the number and extent of excuses for states to control service providers from other member states grows beyond the present situation , the original rationale of the draft directive is lost , " he wrote .
" if the text ends up according to last week 's compromise , it is better to vote against it , than support a directive that creates new obstacles and freezes europe 's services market for 30 more years . " the eu parliament was eager to produce a broad majority so that member states , who are themselves deeply divided on the issue , will not be tempted to veer from its text when it is the governments ' turn to look at the package . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to put service sector reform to the test plans to throw open europe 's vast services sector to tougher competition faces a crunch week as the european parliament prepares to vote on hotly contested new legislation .

previous versions of the bill , which allowed companies to follow the standards of their home country , met with stiff resistance . the bill 's opponents , including germany , france and austria , fear an influx of cheap labor - epitomized by " polish plumbers " willing to work longer for less pay - would undercut local competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child care is one of the services the compromise would not open changes needed to push competition free market supporters , such as britain and the eu 's new east european member states , have said the directive is necessary to increase competition across the union . the agreed upon proposal , however , is too weak for some proponents .
epp vice-president and hungarian parliamentarian józsef szájer wrote in wednesday 's financial times that he thought a majority for a broader proposal could still be found and called on lawmakers to vote against the compromise . " if the number and extent of excuses for states to control service providers from other member states grows beyond the present situation , the original rationale of the draft directive is lost , " he wrote .
" if the text ends up according to last week 's compromise , it is better to vote against it , than support a directive that creates new obstacles and freezes europe 's services market for 30 more years . " the eu parliament was eager to produce a broad majority so that member states , who are themselves deeply divided on the issue , will not be tempted to veer from its text when it is the governments ' turn to look at the package . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to put service sector reform to the test plans to throw open europe 's vast services sector to tougher competition faces a crunch week as the european parliament prepares to vote on hotly contested new legislation .

but come summer , he is hoping belis , his prague-based company , will have more work than ever thanks to a european parliament decision to open the bloc 's service sector . " we can sell swimming pools with our technology to germany but can not install them - that is really slowing us down , " he said , adding that he sold about 60 pools to germans last year .
" we would happily go and install our products for two days or longer and then go back home . " a 394-215 decision by eu lawmakers on thursday will get horn a step closer to having his own employees setting up pools across europe by knocking down nearly all of the national barriers that keep companies from one member state from offering their services in another eu country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horn said his workers want to install pools then go home " a foundation of the eu is the free movement of good and workers , " horn said .
" now we are in the eu , and our goods can move freely , but there still is not any movement in the labor force . " some fears and resistance remain not everyone in europe is happy to see the service sector expand .
on tuesday more than 20,000 people demonstrated against the plan , arguing it would lead to declining standards , lower wages and job losses , especially in the " older " eu member states . " it is not time for opening up services , above all when you have no rules for social harmonization and public services , " said french socialist pervenche beres .
" we ca n't accept the exclusion of social policy and consumer protection from the directive 's scope . " the approved directive requires companies adhere to the host nation 's laws , not their home-country requirements , a provision that previously led to the rejection of similar proposals as a number of eu states feared a flood of cheap migrant workers would undercut local businesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands took to the streets of strasbourg to protest the proposed directive horn , however , said he is prepared to meet each country 's conditions but was being held back by lengthy licensing procedures designed to protect local workers every time he wants to send his employees abroad . only britain , ireland and sweden opened their borders to foreign workers when the eu expanded to 25 members in may 2004 and are profiting from influx of workers while other nations continue to require work permits or have quotas in place to ward off mass migration , according to a eu report . no flood of migrant workers " membership in the eu does not trigger migration , " industry commissioner günter verheugen , the architect of the eu 's enlargement , told the press .
" on the contrary , -lrb- it -rrb- is a strong incentive to stay home and to try to improve living conditions there because there is new hope . " now horn said he is hoping the european commission and member states , which both need to approve the recently passed bill before it becomes binding , will quickly put their support behind the proposal so he can help non-czech 's cool off this summer . " drive there , install the product and come back - that 's the mentality of our employees , " he said .

on tuesday , iranian director rafi pitts screened his new film " zemestan – it 's winter " which is competing for the berlinale 's golden bear prize this year . " for any film - whether iranian or not - a podium like berlin obviously is beautiful , " pitts said .
" because it helps art exist .
if you work in art house cinema , how else are you going to get people to find out about it ?
how else are you going to give that podium for smaller distributors to be helped and they release it .
so it 's a question to tell the world that the film exists . " the place to pick up quality european indies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european indies are drawing in the crowds at berlinale this year although hollywood blockbusters are also featured in berlin , their distribution and public relations deals were made long ago as part of their financing .
in berlin , the berlinale 's six sections mainly focus on art house cinema . and it 's at the european film market that the independent scene 's new releases are promoted and international distribution rights are negotiated . " this year we have a selection of 625 films coming from i think 48 countries , " said efm-director beki probst .
" we have a lot of american independents ; we are still going on with the straight-from-sundance program .
we have , of course , a lot of european films , also of course german films .
and we do have a lot of films from asia . " the efm is a real chance for independent films to find a wider audience .
edgy german competition-entry " elementary particles " became a market hit last week .
distributor celluloid dreams sold the adaptation of michel houellebecq 's book to distributors in 23 countries – all within 24 hours of the film 's berlinale debut . german films , actors and directors in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german film " elementary particles " has made a big splash " i think that there 's really something spectacular happening with the german cinema at the moment , " enthused beki probst .
such resurgence is good news for the german box office which is sorely in need of a boost .
like most of europe , cinema admissions were down last year in germany to 21.5 million , a slump from the 36.7 million of the previous year . but this year , traders are paying particular attention to new german actors , young directors and their films .
the diversity in style and content has never been broader .
this year 's berlinale is showcasing 55 local films in all , including four in the festival 's main competition . europe looks to the future with funding initiative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of european films will hopefully boost ticket sales in 2006 with more than 700 films now being produced each year in europe , a new think tank was launched at the european film market this week by the danish film institute .
" if we want to promote european films and make sure the 1.5 billion euros spent on supporting european films are used correctly , we should use funding more effectively , " the institute said . european film makers are hoping that the discussions find a way to better support their products and to allow artists to bring their visions to life and to the market place at places like the berlinale . peter zimmermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale applauds german film about rapist a film about a rapist 's attempts to escape his past at the berlinale upholds the film festival 's reputation for dealing with wrenching subjects .

dr. stefanie ritz-timme of the institute for forensic medicine in düsseldorf helped create the software and said it is the first of its kind . scientists and police hope to refine the software enough to be able to scan the massive amounts of image data that investigators routinely confiscate .
the software would automatically filter out images of children from older people , thereby relieving police of having to do the job manually .
the german criminal police office is collaborating with the team of forensic scientists and anthropologists - from germany , italy and lithuania - in the further development of the program .
the european union is also sponsoring the project with one million euros . the program is fast to spot a child bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric scanner identifies facial features the program currently requires just two minutes to classify an image of a face by age .
when the software scans an image databank , it can weed out illegal child pornography from permitted adult pornography found on the internet . for the specialized software to work , facial patterns must first be " logged " into the program .
the research team thus photographed the faces of 600 german , italian and lithuanian children and entered their facial characteristics into the program .
the researchers intend to photograph another 1,650 children and young people to enhance the software 's detection capabilities . different types of software help police trace victims while the computer program 's ability to pinpoint facial characteristics specific to children is new , computer software to hunt down child porn traffickers is not .
in september 2005 , the international criminal police organization interpol announced it would launch a major campaign to identify child sex victims and prosecute abusers with the help of special software . the software is supposed to minutely analyze pornographic material on the internet and spot key background clues .
according to reuters news agency , hamish mcculloch - an interpol official - said police around the world would have access to the technology and image database . " currently , investigations tend to focus on trying to seize computers , forensically examine the hard drive and obtain the evidence to prosecute for possession or distribution -lrb- of child pornography -rrb- , " mcculloch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet pornography is easily accessible but the efforts are often in vain as many countries have n't pushed for identifying and prosecuting child sex abusers .
therefore , the focus must be on identifying the victims , mcculloch said . " once you 've identified the victim , you 've identified the abuser .
the vast majority is identified through the victims , " he said .
interpol has built up a databank of hundreds of thousands of images of child porn victims and as a result has managed to rescue at least several hundred children . analyzing crime scenes leads to finding victims the specialized software , however , not only helps to identify victims , but also crime scenes .
in one famous case , interpol analyzed the photo of a young girl found on a computer in the united states and linked it to four pictures from belgium .
the software was able to determine that the four different children shown separately had been photographed in the same room because it had recognized the wallpaper pattern in the background .
investigators eventually traced the victims and found the abuser . according to the international children 's watchdog agency ecpat , based in bangkok , most child pornography is exchanged for free online .
however , it has also sparked an underground business worth billions of dollars that distributes millions of images of child sex abuse . despite the new detection software , police are hard-pressed to keep up with other technological developments .
digital cameras , web sites and e-mail make it easy for computer users to circulate any images they want . ecpat says half of the images of child abuse sold online come from the united states , and another quarter comes from russia .
the agency is calling for tougher laws that would require internet providers to monitor for sexual photos of children . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vast police probe pursues child porn police across europe swooped down on dozens of locations and arrested more than 20 suspects in a vast operation against an online child pornography network , the largest of its kind coordinated by europol .

dr. stefanie ritz-timme of the institute for forensic medicine in düsseldorf helped create the software and said it is the first of its kind . scientists and police hope to refine the software enough to be able to scan the massive amounts of image data that investigators routinely confiscate .
the software would automatically filter out images of children from older people , thereby relieving police of having to do the job manually .
the german criminal police office is collaborating with the team of forensic scientists and anthropologists - from germany , italy and lithuania - in the further development of the program .
the european union is also sponsoring the project with one million euros . the program is fast to spot a child bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric scanner identifies facial features the program currently requires just two minutes to classify an image of a face by age .
when the software scans an image databank , it can weed out illegal child pornography from permitted adult pornography found on the internet . for the specialized software to work , facial patterns must first be " logged " into the program .
the research team thus photographed the faces of 600 german , italian and lithuanian children and entered their facial characteristics into the program .
the researchers intend to photograph another 1,650 children and young people to enhance the software 's detection capabilities . different types of software help police trace victims while the computer program 's ability to pinpoint facial characteristics specific to children is new , computer software to hunt down child porn traffickers is not .
in september 2005 , the international criminal police organization interpol announced it would launch a major campaign to identify child sex victims and prosecute abusers with the help of special software . the software is supposed to minutely analyze pornographic material on the internet and spot key background clues .
according to reuters news agency , hamish mcculloch - an interpol official - said police around the world would have access to the technology and image database . " currently , investigations tend to focus on trying to seize computers , forensically examine the hard drive and obtain the evidence to prosecute for possession or distribution -lrb- of child pornography -rrb- , " mcculloch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet pornography is easily accessible but the efforts are often in vain as many countries have n't pushed for identifying and prosecuting child sex abusers .
therefore , the focus must be on identifying the victims , mcculloch said . " once you 've identified the victim , you 've identified the abuser .
the vast majority is identified through the victims , " he said .
interpol has built up a databank of hundreds of thousands of images of child porn victims and as a result has managed to rescue at least several hundred children . analyzing crime scenes leads to finding victims the specialized software , however , not only helps to identify victims , but also crime scenes .
in one famous case , interpol analyzed the photo of a young girl found on a computer in the united states and linked it to four pictures from belgium .
the software was able to determine that the four different children shown separately had been photographed in the same room because it had recognized the wallpaper pattern in the background .
investigators eventually traced the victims and found the abuser . according to the international children 's watchdog agency ecpat , based in bangkok , most child pornography is exchanged for free online .
however , it has also sparked an underground business worth billions of dollars that distributes millions of images of child sex abuse . despite the new detection software , police are hard-pressed to keep up with other technological developments .

" it is a sub-type of h5n1 , which first appeared among poultry in china last year , " seehofer said in a speech carried on german television .
" even with the most rigorous action we can not assume that we will overcome this matter in a few weeks . " " given the worldwide spread of this virus , we are expecting more cases in germany , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer urged citizens to remain calm in the face of the outbreak seehofer 's agriculture ministry issued a ban on keeping poultry out of doors on wednesday , bringing the action forward to feb .
17 after the ministry had changed the date to feb .
20 from march 1 only hours before . the rural northern state of mecklenburg-vorpommern , where the infected swans were found , would be the first area to feel the immediate effect of the ban . the state was left reeling after a further 40 dead swans were found near the area where the first cases were found . seehofer urged the german public to remain calm and reiterated the opinion of health experts by saying that there was no evidence the disease could yet be spread from human to human , although a mutation in the virus could make this possible if someone suffering from human flu contracts the disease . migrating birds mixing with poultry a big risk the minister pointed to a heightened risk of the virus spreading across europe as migrating birds start returning to the continent .
" the return of migrating birds poses a big risk , " he said , adding that the top priority must be given to preventing bird flu spreading to farm animals , especially poultry bred for consumption . " we are dealing with a dangerous animal disease which also has potential danger to humans , " he said .
" the risk of the disease being spread by migrating birds must be regarded as considerably higher than previously .
it is essential that we prevent the disease being transmitted from wild birds to domestic poultry . " outbreaks of bird flu have now been recorded along the main migration routes . seehofer confirmed that a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- protection area had been set up around the island off northern germany where the dead swans were found .
a larger 10-kilometre surveillance zone is also in place around rügen , which lies 50 kilometers from northwestern poland . casual approach to dead swans criticized by politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dead swans remained untouched as state authorities dithered the mecklenburg-vorpommern authorities have been heavily criticized by a number of prominent german politicians for their casual reaction to the discovery of the dead birds . scenes of the dead swans lying over an expanse of beach showed little or no activity from state officials .
there was a distinct lack of anyone attempting to clear away the corpses or examine them in order to find the causes of their deaths . in response to the criticism , mecklenburg-vorpommern state environment and farm minister till backhaus admitted there had been some problems but blamed germany 's federal system for tying the hands of the state . under the federal system , local district councils had responsibility to collect and test dead birds and state authorities had no power to act . backhaus did add that he had been in contact with local councils and expected more rapid action . death toll yet to include eu victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : measures are being taken in europe to prevent the virus affecting the human population bird flu has already killed at least 90 people - almost half those who caught it - mostly in southeast asia and china where it first erupted but also in the asian part of turkey and northern iraq . in europe , the presence of the h5n1 virus has been confirmed in bulgaria , romania , greece , austria , italy , germany and the european part of russia . hungary , croatia , slovenia and ukraine are among countries investigating possible outbreaks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global infections and human cost here is a country-by-country breakdown of confirmed cases of avian flu in humans , as reported by the united nations world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- .

" it is a sub-type of h5n1 , which first appeared among poultry in china last year , " seehofer said in a speech carried on german television .
" even with the most rigorous action we can not assume that we will overcome this matter in a few weeks .

european lawmakers approved a hotly contested plan to open the bloc 's vast service sector thursday .
the plan enjoys the support of the eu 's two largest parties , but some smaller groups are unhappy with the deal . the proposed directive , which the european commission originally put on the table in 2004 , aims to create a european service market free of most administrative and political obstacles currently holding back service providers from setting up shop in other member states .
supporters also hope it will generate much-needed jobs in the 25-nation bloc . " we can now move on to focus on the delivery of real economic benefits for consumers and companies , " said eurodeputy malcom harbour , who worked on the text on behalf of the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , the biggest political group in the parliament . the services sector is responsible for half the economic activity in the eu and 60 percent of its jobs .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said reforms are essential for spurring employment and growth in europe 's long-flagging economy . the directive , which still needs to be approved by the european commission and member states , would cover any service not explicitly excluded or covered by other eu-wide legislation .
catering , advertising , architects , the construction industry , accountants , hairdressing and the computer industry would all be covered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when they finish , these students could offer their services across europe the epp and the socialists , the parliament 's two largest parties , agreed health care and social services such as social housing and childcare would be excluded as well as services like education that are provided directly by the state . in order to reach a compromise before thursday 's vote , the parties watered down the proposal to allow member states to bar service providers for a number of reasons , provided the intervention is non-discriminatory . companies to follow host nation 's laws " what we 've got now is a directive which very clearly will promote opening markets , reduce red tape and facilitate cooperation , " german social democrat evelyne gebhardt told journalists .
" at the same time , i think it takes account of the rights of workers and consumers . " the deal , which passed by a 394-215 margin , will allow companies to provide their services across the eu , but require them to adhere to the labor , health , safety and environmental standards of the host country .
previous versions of the bill , which allowed companies to follow the standards of their home country , met with stiff resistance . the bill 's opponents , including germany , france and austria , fear an influx of cheap labor - epitomized by " polish plumbers " willing to work longer for less pay - would undercut local competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child care is one of the services the compromise would not open changes needed to push competition free market supporters , such as britain and the eu 's new east european member states , have said the directive is necessary to increase competition across the union . the agreed upon proposal , however , is too weak for some proponents .
epp vice-president and hungarian parliamentarian józsef szájer wrote in wednesday 's financial times that he thought a majority for a broader proposal could still be found and called on lawmakers to vote against the compromise . " if the number and extent of excuses for states to control service providers from other member states grows beyond the present situation , the original rationale of the draft directive is lost , " he wrote .
" if the text ends up according to last week 's compromise , it is better to vote against it , than support a directive that creates new obstacles and freezes europe 's services market for 30 more years . " the eu parliament was eager to produce a broad majority so that member states , who are themselves deeply divided on the issue , will not be tempted to veer from its text when it is the governments ' turn to look at the package . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to put service sector reform to the test plans to throw open europe 's vast services sector to tougher competition faces a crunch week as the european parliament prepares to vote on hotly contested new legislation .

the plan enjoys the support of the eu 's two largest parties , but some smaller groups are unhappy with the deal . the proposed directive , which the european commission originally put on the table in 2004 , aims to create a european service market free of most administrative and political obstacles currently holding back service providers from setting up shop in other member states .
supporters also hope it will generate much-needed jobs in the 25-nation bloc . " we can now move on to focus on the delivery of real economic benefits for consumers and companies , " said eurodeputy malcom harbour , who worked on the text on behalf of the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , the biggest political group in the parliament . the services sector is responsible for half the economic activity in the eu and 60 percent of its jobs .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said reforms are essential for spurring employment and growth in europe 's long-flagging economy . the directive , which still needs to be approved by the european commission and member states , would cover any service not explicitly excluded or covered by other eu-wide legislation .
catering , advertising , architects , the construction industry , accountants , hairdressing and the computer industry would all be covered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when they finish , these students could offer their services across europe the epp and the socialists , the parliament 's two largest parties , agreed health care and social services such as social housing and childcare would be excluded as well as services like education that are provided directly by the state . in order to reach a compromise before thursday 's vote , the parties watered down the proposal to allow member states to bar service providers for a number of reasons , provided the intervention is non-discriminatory . companies to follow host nation 's laws " what we 've got now is a directive which very clearly will promote opening markets , reduce red tape and facilitate cooperation , " german social democrat evelyne gebhardt told journalists .
" at the same time , i think it takes account of the rights of workers and consumers . " the deal , which passed by a 394-215 margin , will allow companies to provide their services across the eu , but require them to adhere to the labor , health , safety and environmental standards of the host country .
previous versions of the bill , which allowed companies to follow the standards of their home country , met with stiff resistance . the bill 's opponents , including germany , france and austria , fear an influx of cheap labor - epitomized by " polish plumbers " willing to work longer for less pay - would undercut local competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child care is one of the services the compromise would not open changes needed to push competition free market supporters , such as britain and the eu 's new east european member states , have said the directive is necessary to increase competition across the union . the agreed upon proposal , however , is too weak for some proponents .
epp vice-president and hungarian parliamentarian józsef szájer wrote in wednesday 's financial times that he thought a majority for a broader proposal could still be found and called on lawmakers to vote against the compromise . " if the number and extent of excuses for states to control service providers from other member states grows beyond the present situation , the original rationale of the draft directive is lost , " he wrote .
" if the text ends up according to last week 's compromise , it is better to vote against it , than support a directive that creates new obstacles and freezes europe 's services market for 30 more years . " the eu parliament was eager to produce a broad majority so that member states , who are themselves deeply divided on the issue , will not be tempted to veer from its text when it is the governments ' turn to look at the package . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to put service sector reform to the test plans to throw open europe 's vast services sector to tougher competition faces a crunch week as the european parliament prepares to vote on hotly contested new legislation .

one german state has decided to heed the call . bavaria makes no bones about the importance of its cultural identity , in which local language plays a particularly important role .
it should , therefore , come as little surprise that the sprawling southern state should be the first to launch a targeted initiative to reignite regional passions for its spoken heritage now deemed to be threatened by extinction .
earlier this month , the bavarian culture ministry presented a grand plan to help prevent its dialects from falling prey to linguistic evolution and the long arm of globalization .
the idea is to provide schools , both primary and secondary , with teaching material which would facilitate the integration of local dialects into regular classes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linguistic snobbery should become a thing of the past harald niedermair , a spokesman for the culture ministry , said one of the main aims of the project is to stamp out the stigma which is still attached to being a dialect speaker .
" even today , there are people who view local dialects as an inferior means of communication .
we want to prevent a situation in which pupils are excluded simply because of the way they speak . "
dialect no deficit niedermair said the proposed model , which could incorporate local dialects into subjects as diverse as theater , geography , music and math , promotes the virtue in being able to speak a second language , even if one of them is restricted to a relatively small geographical area .
" we want to support children 's ability for bilingualism , to show that it is something positive rather than a deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how bavarian are they once they start to speak ?
dialectologist bernhard stör agreed it was important to encourage children to speak in dialect , but said the culture ministry 's proposals do n't get to the root of the problem .
" as long as the general public views local dialect as a negative thing , the ministerial guidelines for teachers are nothing short of ridiculous . "
he said that schools ca n't be expected to influence the situation unless 50 percent of teaching is conducted in dialect .
too much too soon stör said dialects have been fighting a losing battle since the 1960s , when it became fashionable for children to tone down their indigenous tongues to remove any obstructions along the path to learning the purer " high german " considered the key to a successful future .
" the general idea back then was that if children were having to learn both their dialect and german , they were being exposed to unnecessary confusion , " stör said .

" only four percent of greater munich residents under the age of 25 have so much as a passive understanding of the old bavarian dialect , " stör said .
although further out of town the numbers are a little higher , unless something is done to reverse the trend , it is only a matter of time before the city mentality reaches the countryside , he said .
too uncool for words " cities are always the linguistic frontrunners , " stör said , adding that the feeling among youngsters in munich is that dialect is simply uncool .
" children have absorbed the mentality of their parents , and often equate dialects with being dumb .

he said that schools ca n't be expected to influence the situation unless 50 percent of teaching is conducted in dialect .

" -lrb- wednesday 's -rrb- decision ... was taken in light of the rapid spread of avian influenza over the past months and the current high risk of the disease spreading further , " said the european commission in a statement . so far , the h5n1 virus - which in its highly pathogenic form can be fatal to humans - has been detected within europe in austria , bulgaria , croatia , germany , greece , italy , romania , slovenia and ukraine . health commissioner marko kyprianou , attending the two days of talks with health experts from eu member states , underlined that there is unlikely to be an early end to the cases of bird flu . " given that the spring migration will begin soon we will review again the situation to see if there 's need for additional methods ...
we should n't be surprised if we have more migratory wild birds with this virus , " he said . " there 's no need to panic , " he warned .
" we have to advise the european public to stay calm ... there 's no reason not to consume chicken . " the potentially lethal h5n1 strain has killed at least 90 people - almost half those who caught it - mostly in southeast asia and china where it first erupted but also in turkey and northern iraq . eu fears transmission of virus into human food chain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission said that the consumption of chicken is not a threat , at the moment the big fear in the eu - which is the world 's third biggest exporter of poultry after the united states and brazil - is that the virus passes from migratory swans to chickens , or other birds in the human food chain . the avian virus , first reported on europe 's southeastern flanks in early january , re-erupted with a vengeance last week , starting in italy and greece but now with almost daily cases in a string of european countries . in germany , authorities wednesday set up the now-standard 10-kilometer -lrb- six-mile -rrb- surveillance zone around the site where the dead wild swans were found on the island of rügen in the baltic sea . hours later hungary confirmed that it had detected the h5-type virus in the bodies of three dead swans in the south of the country . bloc admits it is powerless to stop the disease arriving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nothing can be done to prevent migratory birds landing in europe as the eu scrambles , some underline that there is basically little it can do to prevent the disease arriving .
" we have absolutely no control over the introduction of the virus by migratory birds that are about to start returning from africa to siberia , scandinavia and greenland , " said french food safety agency panelist jean hars .
" it is unavoidable , " he told reporters . until recently , the eu has said it is satisfied that the measures taken are sufficient . but brussels is closely monitoring the situation and if poultry should become infected , it may call for the culling of all birds and eggs on small holdings or farms .
in addition the european commission has proposed speeding up the process of clamping down on new outbreaks , by making arrangements automatic rather than on a case-by-case basis . experts assess " minimum risk " to poultry flocks meanwhile , health experts said wednesday that migrant birds carrying the virus appear to pose only a limited risk to western europe 's poultry flocks . in contrast to asia and africa , where chickens , ducks and geese raised for the pot are generally grown in open fields and farmyards , most of the european union 's poultry spends its life in large , enclosed sheds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized farms stand a good chance of remianing virus-free " migrating birds do not come into contact with fowl in these industrialized farms , so this is reassuring , " said jeanne brugere-picoux , a professor at the alfort veterinary school near paris and a pathologist in bird diseases .
" but precautions still have to be taken .
migrating birds are a risk , although the risk is more specifically for farmyard fowl which live out in the open and for domestic ducks , " she said . julian hughes , head of species conservation at the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- in britain , said the biggest potential source of transmission was in ponds , lakes or wetlands .
" the virus can be transmitted through a variety of ways , " he told reporters . " we know that the virus stays active within feces and in water for several days after it 's been shed from the bird .
but another route which is just as likely is direct contact , through nasal and bodily fluids , through the bill or the nose . ” " ducks and geese congregate in large numbers , thousands of them together .
they all feed together and when they roost at night , they tend to roost together in the middle of the water , so they are in pretty close contact . " spread attributed in part to movement of diseased poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range diseased poultry pose just as much threat as migratory birds hughes said it was quite possible that migrating birds could pick up the virus from infected poultry , rather than the other way round .
and he called for a sense of proportion , noting that outbreaks of bird flu were chiefly caused by the movement of diseased poultry , not wildlife . " the danger is that if everyone talks and concentrates on migratory birds , then bio-security measures get neglected , " he said . trying to stamp out h5n1 in wild birds through culls " is going to be entirely ineffective , because there are millions of birds on the move , " he said .
" but you can do something about bio-security in the poultry sector .

" -lrb- wednesday 's -rrb- decision ... was taken in light of the rapid spread of avian influenza over the past months and the current high risk of the disease spreading further , " said the european commission in a statement . so far , the h5n1 virus - which in its highly pathogenic form can be fatal to humans - has been detected within europe in austria , bulgaria , croatia , germany , greece , italy , romania , slovenia and ukraine . health commissioner marko kyprianou , attending the two days of talks with health experts from eu member states , underlined that there is unlikely to be an early end to the cases of bird flu . " given that the spring migration will begin soon we will review again the situation to see if there 's need for additional methods ...
we should n't be surprised if we have more migratory wild birds with this virus , " he said . " there 's no need to panic , " he warned .
" we have to advise the european public to stay calm ... there 's no reason not to consume chicken . " the potentially lethal h5n1 strain has killed at least 90 people - almost half those who caught it - mostly in southeast asia and china where it first erupted but also in turkey and northern iraq . eu fears transmission of virus into human food chain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission said that the consumption of chicken is not a threat , at the moment the big fear in the eu - which is the world 's third biggest exporter of poultry after the united states and brazil - is that the virus passes from migratory swans to chickens , or other birds in the human food chain . the avian virus , first reported on europe 's southeastern flanks in early january , re-erupted with a vengeance last week , starting in italy and greece but now with almost daily cases in a string of european countries . in germany , authorities wednesday set up the now-standard 10-kilometer -lrb- six-mile -rrb- surveillance zone around the site where the dead wild swans were found on the island of rügen in the baltic sea . hours later hungary confirmed that it had detected the h5-type virus in the bodies of three dead swans in the south of the country . bloc admits it is powerless to stop the disease arriving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nothing can be done to prevent migratory birds landing in europe as the eu scrambles , some underline that there is basically little it can do to prevent the disease arriving .
" we have absolutely no control over the introduction of the virus by migratory birds that are about to start returning from africa to siberia , scandinavia and greenland , " said french food safety agency panelist jean hars .
" it is unavoidable , " he told reporters . until recently , the eu has said it is satisfied that the measures taken are sufficient . but brussels is closely monitoring the situation and if poultry should become infected , it may call for the culling of all birds and eggs on small holdings or farms .
in addition the european commission has proposed speeding up the process of clamping down on new outbreaks , by making arrangements automatic rather than on a case-by-case basis . experts assess " minimum risk " to poultry flocks meanwhile , health experts said wednesday that migrant birds carrying the virus appear to pose only a limited risk to western europe 's poultry flocks . in contrast to asia and africa , where chickens , ducks and geese raised for the pot are generally grown in open fields and farmyards , most of the european union 's poultry spends its life in large , enclosed sheds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized farms stand a good chance of remianing virus-free " migrating birds do not come into contact with fowl in these industrialized farms , so this is reassuring , " said jeanne brugere-picoux , a professor at the alfort veterinary school near paris and a pathologist in bird diseases .
" but precautions still have to be taken .
migrating birds are a risk , although the risk is more specifically for farmyard fowl which live out in the open and for domestic ducks , " she said . julian hughes , head of species conservation at the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- in britain , said the biggest potential source of transmission was in ponds , lakes or wetlands .
" the virus can be transmitted through a variety of ways , " he told reporters . " we know that the virus stays active within feces and in water for several days after it 's been shed from the bird .
but another route which is just as likely is direct contact , through nasal and bodily fluids , through the bill or the nose . ” " ducks and geese congregate in large numbers , thousands of them together .
they all feed together and when they roost at night , they tend to roost together in the middle of the water , so they are in pretty close contact . " spread attributed in part to movement of diseased poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range diseased poultry pose just as much threat as migratory birds hughes said it was quite possible that migrating birds could pick up the virus from infected poultry , rather than the other way round .
and he called for a sense of proportion , noting that outbreaks of bird flu were chiefly caused by the movement of diseased poultry , not wildlife . " the danger is that if everyone talks and concentrates on migratory birds , then bio-security measures get neglected , " he said . trying to stamp out h5n1 in wild birds through culls " is going to be entirely ineffective , because there are millions of birds on the move , " he said .

could it force the transrapid consortium onto the holding track on the sought-after chinese market ? china is developing a model to compete with the german high-speed magnetic levitation train transrapid .
according to the german newspaper die welt , chinese researchers in shanghai already want to test their own version in july . the chinese model with the name zhui feng -lrb- hunt the wind -rrb- would reach speeds of 500 kilometers an hour -lrb- 310 mph -rrb- and therefore be as fast as the german transrapid . chief engineer zheng from the chengdu aircraft industry cooperation -lrb- cac -rrb- , which is developing the train , said cac was not simply copying transrapid . " the one we 're building is completely different from the german one , " said zheng , who is responsible for design and technology .
" basically , we do n't know that much about the german technology . " he said cac did n't use any german materials or plans . german transrapid has more advantages the only transrapid connection in the world links shanghai and its airport .
china is planning an extension of this connection to the city of hangzhou , 180 kilometers away . transrapid spokesman peter wiegelmann said the german train had a significant advantage compared to the chinese competition .
it has been in commercial use for three years and proven its dependability .
it has transported six million passengers already . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german transrapid consortium is hoping for an order from britain " that 's why we expect opportunities with the transrapid technology , " said wiegelmann .

the transrapid consortium is pushing for speedy construction of the long-awaited airport connection in munich .
the project approval procedure is currently in process . the transrapid consortium also hopes for orders from the united states , britain and the middle east . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , beijing sign high-speed rail deal china said it had signed a cooperation agreement with germany 's transport ministry for joint development of high-speed rail technology .

but come summer , he is hoping belis , his prague-based company , will have more work than ever thanks to a european parliament decision to open the bloc 's service sector . " we can sell swimming pools with our technology to germany but can not install them - that is really slowing us down , " he said , adding that he sold about 60 pools to germans last year .
" we would happily go and install our products for two days or longer and then go back home . " a 394-215 decision by eu lawmakers on thursday will get horn a step closer to having his own employees setting up pools across europe by knocking down nearly all of the national barriers that keep companies from one member state from offering their services in another eu country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horn said his workers want to install pools then go home " a foundation of the eu is the free movement of good and workers , " horn said .
" now we are in the eu , and our goods can move freely , but there still is not any movement in the labor force . " some fears and resistance remain not everyone in europe is happy to see the service sector expand .
on tuesday more than 20,000 people demonstrated against the plan , arguing it would lead to declining standards , lower wages and job losses , especially in the " older " eu member states . " it is not time for opening up services , above all when you have no rules for social harmonization and public services , " said french socialist pervenche beres .
" we ca n't accept the exclusion of social policy and consumer protection from the directive 's scope . " the approved directive requires companies adhere to the host nation 's laws , not their home-country requirements , a provision that previously led to the rejection of similar proposals as a number of eu states feared a flood of cheap migrant workers would undercut local businesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands took to the streets of strasbourg to protest the proposed directive horn , however , said he is prepared to meet each country 's conditions but was being held back by lengthy licensing procedures designed to protect local workers every time he wants to send his employees abroad . only britain , ireland and sweden opened their borders to foreign workers when the eu expanded to 25 members in may 2004 and are profiting from influx of workers while other nations continue to require work permits or have quotas in place to ward off mass migration , according to a eu report . no flood of migrant workers " membership in the eu does not trigger migration , " industry commissioner günter verheugen , the architect of the eu 's enlargement , told the press .
" on the contrary , -lrb- it -rrb- is a strong incentive to stay home and to try to improve living conditions there because there is new hope . " now horn said he is hoping the european commission and member states , which both need to approve the recently passed bill before it becomes binding , will quickly put their support behind the proposal so he can help non-czech 's cool off this summer . " drive there , install the product and come back - that 's the mentality of our employees , " he said .
" they will do that two or three times a month , but no one is interested in leaving their family for half a year at a time - they do n't even want to move to another place in the czech republic for work .

european lawmakers approved a hotly contested plan to open the bloc 's vast service sector thursday .
the plan enjoys the support of the eu 's two largest parties , but some smaller groups are unhappy with the deal . the proposed directive , which the european commission originally put on the table in 2004 , aims to create a european service market free of most administrative and political obstacles currently holding back service providers from setting up shop in other member states .
supporters also hope it will generate much-needed jobs in the 25-nation bloc . " we can now move on to focus on the delivery of real economic benefits for consumers and companies , " said eurodeputy malcom harbour , who worked on the text on behalf of the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , the biggest political group in the parliament . the services sector is responsible for half the economic activity in the eu and 60 percent of its jobs .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said reforms are essential for spurring employment and growth in europe 's long-flagging economy . the directive , which still needs to be approved by the european commission and member states , would cover any service not explicitly excluded or covered by other eu-wide legislation .
catering , advertising , architects , the construction industry , accountants , hairdressing and the computer industry would all be covered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when they finish , these students could offer their services across europe the epp and the socialists , the parliament 's two largest parties , agreed health care and social services such as social housing and childcare would be excluded as well as services like education that are provided directly by the state . in order to reach a compromise before thursday 's vote , the parties watered down the proposal to allow member states to bar service providers for a number of reasons , provided the intervention is non-discriminatory . companies to follow host nation 's laws " what we 've got now is a directive which very clearly will promote opening markets , reduce red tape and facilitate cooperation , " german social democrat evelyne gebhardt told journalists .
" at the same time , i think it takes account of the rights of workers and consumers . " the deal , which passed by a 394-215 margin , will allow companies to provide their services across the eu , but require them to adhere to the labor , health , safety and environmental standards of the host country .
previous versions of the bill , which allowed companies to follow the standards of their home country , met with stiff resistance . the bill 's opponents , including germany , france and austria , fear an influx of cheap labor - epitomized by " polish plumbers " willing to work longer for less pay - would undercut local competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child care is one of the services the compromise would not open changes needed to push competition free market supporters , such as britain and the eu 's new east european member states , have said the directive is necessary to increase competition across the union . the agreed upon proposal , however , is too weak for some proponents .
epp vice-president and hungarian parliamentarian józsef szájer wrote in wednesday 's financial times that he thought a majority for a broader proposal could still be found and called on lawmakers to vote against the compromise . " if the number and extent of excuses for states to control service providers from other member states grows beyond the present situation , the original rationale of the draft directive is lost , " he wrote .
" if the text ends up according to last week 's compromise , it is better to vote against it , than support a directive that creates new obstacles and freezes europe 's services market for 30 more years . " the eu parliament was eager to produce a broad majority so that member states , who are themselves deeply divided on the issue , will not be tempted to veer from its text when it is the governments ' turn to look at the package . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to put service sector reform to the test plans to throw open europe 's vast services sector to tougher competition faces a crunch week as the european parliament prepares to vote on hotly contested new legislation .

" -lrb- wednesday 's -rrb- decision ... was taken in light of the rapid spread of avian influenza over the past months and the current high risk of the disease spreading further , " said the european commission in a statement . so far , the h5n1 virus - which in its highly pathogenic form can be fatal to humans - has been detected within europe in austria , bulgaria , croatia , germany , greece , italy , romania , slovenia and ukraine . health commissioner marko kyprianou , attending the two days of talks with health experts from eu member states , underlined that there is unlikely to be an early end to the cases of bird flu . " given that the spring migration will begin soon we will review again the situation to see if there 's need for additional methods ...
we should n't be surprised if we have more migratory wild birds with this virus , " he said . " there 's no need to panic , " he warned .
" we have to advise the european public to stay calm ... there 's no reason not to consume chicken . " the potentially lethal h5n1 strain has killed at least 90 people - almost half those who caught it - mostly in southeast asia and china where it first erupted but also in turkey and northern iraq . eu fears transmission of virus into human food chain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission said that the consumption of chicken is not a threat , at the moment the big fear in the eu - which is the world 's third biggest exporter of poultry after the united states and brazil - is that the virus passes from migratory swans to chickens , or other birds in the human food chain . the avian virus , first reported on europe 's southeastern flanks in early january , re-erupted with a vengeance last week , starting in italy and greece but now with almost daily cases in a string of european countries . in germany , authorities wednesday set up the now-standard 10-kilometer -lrb- six-mile -rrb- surveillance zone around the site where the dead wild swans were found on the island of rügen in the baltic sea . hours later hungary confirmed that it had detected the h5-type virus in the bodies of three dead swans in the south of the country . bloc admits it is powerless to stop the disease arriving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nothing can be done to prevent migratory birds landing in europe as the eu scrambles , some underline that there is basically little it can do to prevent the disease arriving .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.02.2006 preserving germany 's linguistic heritage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to being bavarian than dressing the part for years , unesco has been appealing to nations across the globe to promote their indigenous languages by filling classrooms with their multi-colored vernacular .
one german state has decided to heed the call . bavaria makes no bones about the importance of its cultural identity , in which local language plays a particularly important role .
it should , therefore , come as little surprise that the sprawling southern state should be the first to launch a targeted initiative to reignite regional passions for its spoken heritage now deemed to be threatened by extinction .
earlier this month , the bavarian culture ministry presented a grand plan to help prevent its dialects from falling prey to linguistic evolution and the long arm of globalization .
the idea is to provide schools , both primary and secondary , with teaching material which would facilitate the integration of local dialects into regular classes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linguistic snobbery should become a thing of the past harald niedermair , a spokesman for the culture ministry , said one of the main aims of the project is to stamp out the stigma which is still attached to being a dialect speaker .
" even today , there are people who view local dialects as an inferior means of communication .
we want to prevent a situation in which pupils are excluded simply because of the way they speak . "
dialect no deficit niedermair said the proposed model , which could incorporate local dialects into subjects as diverse as theater , geography , music and math , promotes the virtue in being able to speak a second language , even if one of them is restricted to a relatively small geographical area .
" we want to support children 's ability for bilingualism , to show that it is something positive rather than a deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how bavarian are they once they start to speak ?
dialectologist bernhard stör agreed it was important to encourage children to speak in dialect , but said the culture ministry 's proposals do n't get to the root of the problem .
" as long as the general public views local dialect as a negative thing , the ministerial guidelines for teachers are nothing short of ridiculous . "
he said that schools ca n't be expected to influence the situation unless 50 percent of teaching is conducted in dialect .
too much too soon stör said dialects have been fighting a losing battle since the 1960s , when it became fashionable for children to tone down their indigenous tongues to remove any obstructions along the path to learning the purer " high german " considered the key to a successful future .
" the general idea back then was that if children were having to learn both their dialect and german , they were being exposed to unnecessary confusion , " stör said .
but that belief has now been proven untrue .
" new research , however , shows that the sooner they start , the easier it is for children to absorb other languages in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich skyline that said , demographic evolution in bavaria has been such over the past decades that there are simply fewer dialect speakers to spread the word .
from the postwar era to the present day , the population of the bavarian capital , munich , has grown from half a million to almost 2.5 million inhabitants , but far from all of them can speak a local dialect .
" only four percent of greater munich residents under the age of 25 have so much as a passive understanding of the old bavarian dialect , " stör said .
although further out of town the numbers are a little higher , unless something is done to reverse the trend , it is only a matter of time before the city mentality reaches the countryside , he said .
too uncool for words " cities are always the linguistic frontrunners , " stör said , adding that the feeling among youngsters in munich is that dialect is simply uncool .
" children have absorbed the mentality of their parents , and often equate dialects with being dumb .
they think that if they want to get anywhere in their professional lives , they can not be seen to be speaking anything other than high german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr bavarian , edmund stoiber ?
and therein lies the catch .

one german state has decided to heed the call . bavaria makes no bones about the importance of its cultural identity , in which local language plays a particularly important role .
it should , therefore , come as little surprise that the sprawling southern state should be the first to launch a targeted initiative to reignite regional passions for its spoken heritage now deemed to be threatened by extinction .
earlier this month , the bavarian culture ministry presented a grand plan to help prevent its dialects from falling prey to linguistic evolution and the long arm of globalization .
the idea is to provide schools , both primary and secondary , with teaching material which would facilitate the integration of local dialects into regular classes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linguistic snobbery should become a thing of the past harald niedermair , a spokesman for the culture ministry , said one of the main aims of the project is to stamp out the stigma which is still attached to being a dialect speaker .
" even today , there are people who view local dialects as an inferior means of communication .
we want to prevent a situation in which pupils are excluded simply because of the way they speak . "
dialect no deficit niedermair said the proposed model , which could incorporate local dialects into subjects as diverse as theater , geography , music and math , promotes the virtue in being able to speak a second language , even if one of them is restricted to a relatively small geographical area .
" we want to support children 's ability for bilingualism , to show that it is something positive rather than a deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how bavarian are they once they start to speak ?
dialectologist bernhard stör agreed it was important to encourage children to speak in dialect , but said the culture ministry 's proposals do n't get to the root of the problem .
" as long as the general public views local dialect as a negative thing , the ministerial guidelines for teachers are nothing short of ridiculous . "
he said that schools ca n't be expected to influence the situation unless 50 percent of teaching is conducted in dialect .
too much too soon stör said dialects have been fighting a losing battle since the 1960s , when it became fashionable for children to tone down their indigenous tongues to remove any obstructions along the path to learning the purer " high german " considered the key to a successful future .
" the general idea back then was that if children were having to learn both their dialect and german , they were being exposed to unnecessary confusion , " stör said .
but that belief has now been proven untrue .
" new research , however , shows that the sooner they start , the easier it is for children to absorb other languages in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich skyline that said , demographic evolution in bavaria has been such over the past decades that there are simply fewer dialect speakers to spread the word .
from the postwar era to the present day , the population of the bavarian capital , munich , has grown from half a million to almost 2.5 million inhabitants , but far from all of them can speak a local dialect .
" only four percent of greater munich residents under the age of 25 have so much as a passive understanding of the old bavarian dialect , " stör said .
although further out of town the numbers are a little higher , unless something is done to reverse the trend , it is only a matter of time before the city mentality reaches the countryside , he said .
too uncool for words " cities are always the linguistic frontrunners , " stör said , adding that the feeling among youngsters in munich is that dialect is simply uncool .
" children have absorbed the mentality of their parents , and often equate dialects with being dumb .
they think that if they want to get anywhere in their professional lives , they can not be seen to be speaking anything other than high german .

" it is a sub-type of h5n1 , which first appeared among poultry in china last year , " seehofer said in a speech carried on german television .
" even with the most rigorous action we can not assume that we will overcome this matter in a few weeks . " " given the worldwide spread of this virus , we are expecting more cases in germany , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer urged citizens to remain calm in the face of the outbreak seehofer 's agriculture ministry issued a ban on keeping poultry out of doors on wednesday , bringing the action forward to feb .
17 after the ministry had changed the date to feb .
20 from march 1 only hours before . the rural northern state of mecklenburg-vorpommern , where the infected swans were found , would be the first area to feel the immediate effect of the ban . the state was left reeling after a further 40 dead swans were found near the area where the first cases were found . seehofer urged the german public to remain calm and reiterated the opinion of health experts by saying that there was no evidence the disease could yet be spread from human to human , although a mutation in the virus could make this possible if someone suffering from human flu contracts the disease . migrating birds mixing with poultry a big risk the minister pointed to a heightened risk of the virus spreading across europe as migrating birds start returning to the continent .
" the return of migrating birds poses a big risk , " he said , adding that the top priority must be given to preventing bird flu spreading to farm animals , especially poultry bred for consumption . " we are dealing with a dangerous animal disease which also has potential danger to humans , " he said .
" the risk of the disease being spread by migrating birds must be regarded as considerably higher than previously .
it is essential that we prevent the disease being transmitted from wild birds to domestic poultry . " outbreaks of bird flu have now been recorded along the main migration routes . seehofer confirmed that a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- protection area had been set up around the island off northern germany where the dead swans were found .
a larger 10-kilometre surveillance zone is also in place around rügen , which lies 50 kilometers from northwestern poland . casual approach to dead swans criticized by politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dead swans remained untouched as state authorities dithered the mecklenburg-vorpommern authorities have been heavily criticized by a number of prominent german politicians for their casual reaction to the discovery of the dead birds . scenes of the dead swans lying over an expanse of beach showed little or no activity from state officials .
there was a distinct lack of anyone attempting to clear away the corpses or examine them in order to find the causes of their deaths . in response to the criticism , mecklenburg-vorpommern state environment and farm minister till backhaus admitted there had been some problems but blamed germany 's federal system for tying the hands of the state . under the federal system , local district councils had responsibility to collect and test dead birds and state authorities had no power to act . backhaus did add that he had been in contact with local councils and expected more rapid action . death toll yet to include eu victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : measures are being taken in europe to prevent the virus affecting the human population bird flu has already killed at least 90 people - almost half those who caught it - mostly in southeast asia and china where it first erupted but also in the asian part of turkey and northern iraq . in europe , the presence of the h5n1 virus has been confirmed in bulgaria , romania , greece , austria , italy , germany and the european part of russia . hungary , croatia , slovenia and ukraine are among countries investigating possible outbreaks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global infections and human cost here is a country-by-country breakdown of confirmed cases of avian flu in humans , as reported by the united nations world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- .

european indie films are top of the shopping lists the movie stars , the gliterring premieres ... it 's the public face of the berlinale film festival .
but behind the scenes , the hard bargaining happens .
this year , the must-have item for distributors is edgy european cinema . for ten days in february , paparazzi and film fans alike take over marlene dietrich platz in downtown berlin .
the reason ?
berlinale - germany ’ s largest international film festival .
with 400 movies , the first of europe 's three major film festivals is bigger than ever , showing everything from hollywood blockbusters to art house debuts from lesser-known artists . but what has grown most in recent years is the berlinale 's european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- .
since competitor mifed stopped operating in milan , italy , last autumn and the american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moved from april to november , the european film market has become one of the most important events on the industry calendar . it 's the only market worldwide which takes place within the framework of a film-festival .
and among the world ’ s biggest international film festivals , the berlinale is unique .
it 's not just for invited guests and professionals , but is also open to the public . in the berlinale 's 30 cinemas , world premieres test a film ’ s potential success with critics and an international audience alike .
on tuesday , iranian director rafi pitts screened his new film " zemestan – it 's winter " which is competing for the berlinale 's golden bear prize this year . " for any film - whether iranian or not - a podium like berlin obviously is beautiful , " pitts said .
" because it helps art exist .
if you work in art house cinema , how else are you going to get people to find out about it ?
how else are you going to give that podium for smaller distributors to be helped and they release it .
so it 's a question to tell the world that the film exists . " the place to pick up quality european indies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european indies are drawing in the crowds at berlinale this year although hollywood blockbusters are also featured in berlin , their distribution and public relations deals were made long ago as part of their financing .
in berlin , the berlinale 's six sections mainly focus on art house cinema . and it 's at the european film market that the independent scene 's new releases are promoted and international distribution rights are negotiated . " this year we have a selection of 625 films coming from i think 48 countries , " said efm-director beki probst .
" we have a lot of american independents ; we are still going on with the straight-from-sundance program .
we have , of course , a lot of european films , also of course german films .
and we do have a lot of films from asia . " the efm is a real chance for independent films to find a wider audience .
edgy german competition-entry " elementary particles " became a market hit last week .
distributor celluloid dreams sold the adaptation of michel houellebecq 's book to distributors in 23 countries – all within 24 hours of the film 's berlinale debut . german films , actors and directors in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german film " elementary particles " has made a big splash " i think that there 's really something spectacular happening with the german cinema at the moment , " enthused beki probst .
such resurgence is good news for the german box office which is sorely in need of a boost .
like most of europe , cinema admissions were down last year in germany to 21.5 million , a slump from the 36.7 million of the previous year . but this year , traders are paying particular attention to new german actors , young directors and their films .
the diversity in style and content has never been broader .

" if we want to promote european films and make sure the 1.5 billion euros spent on supporting european films are used correctly , we should use funding more effectively , " the institute said . european film makers are hoping that the discussions find a way to better support their products and to allow artists to bring their visions to life and to the market place at places like the berlinale . peter zimmermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale applauds german film about rapist a film about a rapist 's attempts to escape his past at the berlinale upholds the film festival 's reputation for dealing with wrenching subjects .

dr. stefanie ritz-timme of the institute for forensic medicine in düsseldorf helped create the software and said it is the first of its kind . scientists and police hope to refine the software enough to be able to scan the massive amounts of image data that investigators routinely confiscate .
the software would automatically filter out images of children from older people , thereby relieving police of having to do the job manually .
the german criminal police office is collaborating with the team of forensic scientists and anthropologists - from germany , italy and lithuania - in the further development of the program .
the european union is also sponsoring the project with one million euros . the program is fast to spot a child bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric scanner identifies facial features the program currently requires just two minutes to classify an image of a face by age .
when the software scans an image databank , it can weed out illegal child pornography from permitted adult pornography found on the internet . for the specialized software to work , facial patterns must first be " logged " into the program .
the research team thus photographed the faces of 600 german , italian and lithuanian children and entered their facial characteristics into the program .
the researchers intend to photograph another 1,650 children and young people to enhance the software 's detection capabilities . different types of software help police trace victims while the computer program 's ability to pinpoint facial characteristics specific to children is new , computer software to hunt down child porn traffickers is not .
in september 2005 , the international criminal police organization interpol announced it would launch a major campaign to identify child sex victims and prosecute abusers with the help of special software . the software is supposed to minutely analyze pornographic material on the internet and spot key background clues .
according to reuters news agency , hamish mcculloch - an interpol official - said police around the world would have access to the technology and image database . " currently , investigations tend to focus on trying to seize computers , forensically examine the hard drive and obtain the evidence to prosecute for possession or distribution -lrb- of child pornography -rrb- , " mcculloch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet pornography is easily accessible but the efforts are often in vain as many countries have n't pushed for identifying and prosecuting child sex abusers .
therefore , the focus must be on identifying the victims , mcculloch said . " once you 've identified the victim , you 've identified the abuser .
the vast majority is identified through the victims , " he said .
interpol has built up a databank of hundreds of thousands of images of child porn victims and as a result has managed to rescue at least several hundred children . analyzing crime scenes leads to finding victims the specialized software , however , not only helps to identify victims , but also crime scenes .
in one famous case , interpol analyzed the photo of a young girl found on a computer in the united states and linked it to four pictures from belgium .
the software was able to determine that the four different children shown separately had been photographed in the same room because it had recognized the wallpaper pattern in the background .
investigators eventually traced the victims and found the abuser . according to the international children 's watchdog agency ecpat , based in bangkok , most child pornography is exchanged for free online .
however , it has also sparked an underground business worth billions of dollars that distributes millions of images of child sex abuse . despite the new detection software , police are hard-pressed to keep up with other technological developments .
digital cameras , web sites and e-mail make it easy for computer users to circulate any images they want . ecpat says half of the images of child abuse sold online come from the united states , and another quarter comes from russia .
the agency is calling for tougher laws that would require internet providers to monitor for sexual photos of children . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vast police probe pursues child porn police across europe swooped down on dozens of locations and arrested more than 20 suspects in a vast operation against an online child pornography network , the largest of its kind coordinated by europol .

dr. stefanie ritz-timme of the institute for forensic medicine in düsseldorf helped create the software and said it is the first of its kind . scientists and police hope to refine the software enough to be able to scan the massive amounts of image data that investigators routinely confiscate .
the software would automatically filter out images of children from older people , thereby relieving police of having to do the job manually .
the german criminal police office is collaborating with the team of forensic scientists and anthropologists - from germany , italy and lithuania - in the further development of the program .
the european union is also sponsoring the project with one million euros . the program is fast to spot a child bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric scanner identifies facial features the program currently requires just two minutes to classify an image of a face by age .
when the software scans an image databank , it can weed out illegal child pornography from permitted adult pornography found on the internet . for the specialized software to work , facial patterns must first be " logged " into the program .
the research team thus photographed the faces of 600 german , italian and lithuanian children and entered their facial characteristics into the program .
the researchers intend to photograph another 1,650 children and young people to enhance the software 's detection capabilities . different types of software help police trace victims while the computer program 's ability to pinpoint facial characteristics specific to children is new , computer software to hunt down child porn traffickers is not .
in september 2005 , the international criminal police organization interpol announced it would launch a major campaign to identify child sex victims and prosecute abusers with the help of special software . the software is supposed to minutely analyze pornographic material on the internet and spot key background clues .
according to reuters news agency , hamish mcculloch - an interpol official - said police around the world would have access to the technology and image database . " currently , investigations tend to focus on trying to seize computers , forensically examine the hard drive and obtain the evidence to prosecute for possession or distribution -lrb- of child pornography -rrb- , " mcculloch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet pornography is easily accessible but the efforts are often in vain as many countries have n't pushed for identifying and prosecuting child sex abusers .
therefore , the focus must be on identifying the victims , mcculloch said . " once you 've identified the victim , you 've identified the abuser .
the vast majority is identified through the victims , " he said .
interpol has built up a databank of hundreds of thousands of images of child porn victims and as a result has managed to rescue at least several hundred children . analyzing crime scenes leads to finding victims the specialized software , however , not only helps to identify victims , but also crime scenes .
in one famous case , interpol analyzed the photo of a young girl found on a computer in the united states and linked it to four pictures from belgium .
the software was able to determine that the four different children shown separately had been photographed in the same room because it had recognized the wallpaper pattern in the background .
investigators eventually traced the victims and found the abuser . according to the international children 's watchdog agency ecpat , based in bangkok , most child pornography is exchanged for free online .
however , it has also sparked an underground business worth billions of dollars that distributes millions of images of child sex abuse . despite the new detection software , police are hard-pressed to keep up with other technological developments .
digital cameras , web sites and e-mail make it easy for computer users to circulate any images they want . ecpat says half of the images of child abuse sold online come from the united states , and another quarter comes from russia .
the agency is calling for tougher laws that would require internet providers to monitor for sexual photos of children . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vast police probe pursues child porn police across europe swooped down on dozens of locations and arrested more than 20 suspects in a vast operation against an online child pornography network , the largest of its kind coordinated by europol .

dr. stefanie ritz-timme of the institute for forensic medicine in düsseldorf helped create the software and said it is the first of its kind . scientists and police hope to refine the software enough to be able to scan the massive amounts of image data that investigators routinely confiscate .
the software would automatically filter out images of children from older people , thereby relieving police of having to do the job manually .
the german criminal police office is collaborating with the team of forensic scientists and anthropologists - from germany , italy and lithuania - in the further development of the program .
the european union is also sponsoring the project with one million euros . the program is fast to spot a child bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric scanner identifies facial features the program currently requires just two minutes to classify an image of a face by age .
when the software scans an image databank , it can weed out illegal child pornography from permitted adult pornography found on the internet . for the specialized software to work , facial patterns must first be " logged " into the program .
the research team thus photographed the faces of 600 german , italian and lithuanian children and entered their facial characteristics into the program .
the researchers intend to photograph another 1,650 children and young people to enhance the software 's detection capabilities . different types of software help police trace victims while the computer program 's ability to pinpoint facial characteristics specific to children is new , computer software to hunt down child porn traffickers is not .
in september 2005 , the international criminal police organization interpol announced it would launch a major campaign to identify child sex victims and prosecute abusers with the help of special software . the software is supposed to minutely analyze pornographic material on the internet and spot key background clues .
according to reuters news agency , hamish mcculloch - an interpol official - said police around the world would have access to the technology and image database . " currently , investigations tend to focus on trying to seize computers , forensically examine the hard drive and obtain the evidence to prosecute for possession or distribution -lrb- of child pornography -rrb- , " mcculloch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet pornography is easily accessible but the efforts are often in vain as many countries have n't pushed for identifying and prosecuting child sex abusers .
therefore , the focus must be on identifying the victims , mcculloch said . " once you 've identified the victim , you 've identified the abuser .
the vast majority is identified through the victims , " he said .
interpol has built up a databank of hundreds of thousands of images of child porn victims and as a result has managed to rescue at least several hundred children . analyzing crime scenes leads to finding victims the specialized software , however , not only helps to identify victims , but also crime scenes .
in one famous case , interpol analyzed the photo of a young girl found on a computer in the united states and linked it to four pictures from belgium .
the software was able to determine that the four different children shown separately had been photographed in the same room because it had recognized the wallpaper pattern in the background .
investigators eventually traced the victims and found the abuser . according to the international children 's watchdog agency ecpat , based in bangkok , most child pornography is exchanged for free online .
however , it has also sparked an underground business worth billions of dollars that distributes millions of images of child sex abuse . despite the new detection software , police are hard-pressed to keep up with other technological developments .
digital cameras , web sites and e-mail make it easy for computer users to circulate any images they want . ecpat says half of the images of child abuse sold online come from the united states , and another quarter comes from russia .
the agency is calling for tougher laws that would require internet providers to monitor for sexual photos of children . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vast police probe pursues child porn police across europe swooped down on dozens of locations and arrested more than 20 suspects in a vast operation against an online child pornography network , the largest of its kind coordinated by europol .

european lawmakers approved a hotly contested plan to open the bloc 's vast service sector thursday .
the plan enjoys the support of the eu 's two largest parties , but some smaller groups are unhappy with the deal . the proposed directive , which the european commission originally put on the table in 2004 , aims to create a european service market free of most administrative and political obstacles currently holding back service providers from setting up shop in other member states .
supporters also hope it will generate much-needed jobs in the 25-nation bloc . " we can now move on to focus on the delivery of real economic benefits for consumers and companies , " said eurodeputy malcom harbour , who worked on the text on behalf of the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , the biggest political group in the parliament . the services sector is responsible for half the economic activity in the eu and 60 percent of its jobs .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said reforms are essential for spurring employment and growth in europe 's long-flagging economy . the directive , which still needs to be approved by the european commission and member states , would cover any service not explicitly excluded or covered by other eu-wide legislation .
catering , advertising , architects , the construction industry , accountants , hairdressing and the computer industry would all be covered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when they finish , these students could offer their services across europe the epp and the socialists , the parliament 's two largest parties , agreed health care and social services such as social housing and childcare would be excluded as well as services like education that are provided directly by the state . in order to reach a compromise before thursday 's vote , the parties watered down the proposal to allow member states to bar service providers for a number of reasons , provided the intervention is non-discriminatory . companies to follow host nation 's laws " what we 've got now is a directive which very clearly will promote opening markets , reduce red tape and facilitate cooperation , " german social democrat evelyne gebhardt told journalists .
" at the same time , i think it takes account of the rights of workers and consumers . " the deal , which passed by a 394-215 margin , will allow companies to provide their services across the eu , but require them to adhere to the labor , health , safety and environmental standards of the host country .
previous versions of the bill , which allowed companies to follow the standards of their home country , met with stiff resistance . the bill 's opponents , including germany , france and austria , fear an influx of cheap labor - epitomized by " polish plumbers " willing to work longer for less pay - would undercut local competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child care is one of the services the compromise would not open changes needed to push competition free market supporters , such as britain and the eu 's new east european member states , have said the directive is necessary to increase competition across the union . the agreed upon proposal , however , is too weak for some proponents .
epp vice-president and hungarian parliamentarian józsef szájer wrote in wednesday 's financial times that he thought a majority for a broader proposal could still be found and called on lawmakers to vote against the compromise . " if the number and extent of excuses for states to control service providers from other member states grows beyond the present situation , the original rationale of the draft directive is lost , " he wrote .
" if the text ends up according to last week 's compromise , it is better to vote against it , than support a directive that creates new obstacles and freezes europe 's services market for 30 more years . " the eu parliament was eager to produce a broad majority so that member states , who are themselves deeply divided on the issue , will not be tempted to veer from its text when it is the governments ' turn to look at the package . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to put service sector reform to the test plans to throw open europe 's vast services sector to tougher competition faces a crunch week as the european parliament prepares to vote on hotly contested new legislation .

the director says he is emphasizing loneliness , not rape , in the picture . " der freie wille , " or " the free will , " is the second entry in this year 's main competition to deal with the issue of rape .
the bosnian picture " grbavica " has also focused on the topic . a 15-minute scene showing a rape in horrifying detail forms the centerpiece of the german movie screened at the berlinale earlier this week . there will be few scenes committed to film this year more harrowing than the assault of a young woman on a windswept beach which explains how the main figure , theo , comes to serve more than nine years in a secure psychiatric unit . film focuses on an individual jürgen vogel , one of germany 's top actors and better known for comic roles , plays the convicted rapist theo .
he attempts to escape from the terrible longing within him and build a life with an unsuspecting girlfriend , nettie , portrayed by sabine timoteo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress sabine timoteo gives the harsh film a gentle side , says the director the plot skips straight to his life after detention , and his meeting with nettie .
she has suffered years of mental abuse from her divorced father . the blossoming relationship between theo and nettie , which is eventually consumed by his past , are the main subject matter of the 163-minute-long movie . " it is not a film about rape , it is about an individual , " director matthias glasner told a press conference after the screening earlier this week .
" i did n't want to show the treatment for a rapist , which is why there are no scenes of the therapy .

dr. stefanie ritz-timme of the institute for forensic medicine in düsseldorf helped create the software and said it is the first of its kind . scientists and police hope to refine the software enough to be able to scan the massive amounts of image data that investigators routinely confiscate .
the software would automatically filter out images of children from older people , thereby relieving police of having to do the job manually .
the german criminal police office is collaborating with the team of forensic scientists and anthropologists - from germany , italy and lithuania - in the further development of the program .
the european union is also sponsoring the project with one million euros . the program is fast to spot a child bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric scanner identifies facial features the program currently requires just two minutes to classify an image of a face by age .
when the software scans an image databank , it can weed out illegal child pornography from permitted adult pornography found on the internet . for the specialized software to work , facial patterns must first be " logged " into the program .
the research team thus photographed the faces of 600 german , italian and lithuanian children and entered their facial characteristics into the program .
the researchers intend to photograph another 1,650 children and young people to enhance the software 's detection capabilities . different types of software help police trace victims while the computer program 's ability to pinpoint facial characteristics specific to children is new , computer software to hunt down child porn traffickers is not .
in september 2005 , the international criminal police organization interpol announced it would launch a major campaign to identify child sex victims and prosecute abusers with the help of special software . the software is supposed to minutely analyze pornographic material on the internet and spot key background clues .
according to reuters news agency , hamish mcculloch - an interpol official - said police around the world would have access to the technology and image database . " currently , investigations tend to focus on trying to seize computers , forensically examine the hard drive and obtain the evidence to prosecute for possession or distribution -lrb- of child pornography -rrb- , " mcculloch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet pornography is easily accessible but the efforts are often in vain as many countries have n't pushed for identifying and prosecuting child sex abusers .
therefore , the focus must be on identifying the victims , mcculloch said . " once you 've identified the victim , you 've identified the abuser .
the vast majority is identified through the victims , " he said .
interpol has built up a databank of hundreds of thousands of images of child porn victims and as a result has managed to rescue at least several hundred children . analyzing crime scenes leads to finding victims the specialized software , however , not only helps to identify victims , but also crime scenes .
in one famous case , interpol analyzed the photo of a young girl found on a computer in the united states and linked it to four pictures from belgium .
the software was able to determine that the four different children shown separately had been photographed in the same room because it had recognized the wallpaper pattern in the background .
investigators eventually traced the victims and found the abuser . according to the international children 's watchdog agency ecpat , based in bangkok , most child pornography is exchanged for free online .
however , it has also sparked an underground business worth billions of dollars that distributes millions of images of child sex abuse . despite the new detection software , police are hard-pressed to keep up with other technological developments .
digital cameras , web sites and e-mail make it easy for computer users to circulate any images they want . ecpat says half of the images of child abuse sold online come from the united states , and another quarter comes from russia .
the agency is calling for tougher laws that would require internet providers to monitor for sexual photos of children . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vast police probe pursues child porn police across europe swooped down on dozens of locations and arrested more than 20 suspects in a vast operation against an online child pornography network , the largest of its kind coordinated by europol .

the researchers intend to photograph another 1,650 children and young people to enhance the software 's detection capabilities . different types of software help police trace victims while the computer program 's ability to pinpoint facial characteristics specific to children is new , computer software to hunt down child porn traffickers is not .
in september 2005 , the international criminal police organization interpol announced it would launch a major campaign to identify child sex victims and prosecute abusers with the help of special software . the software is supposed to minutely analyze pornographic material on the internet and spot key background clues .
according to reuters news agency , hamish mcculloch - an interpol official - said police around the world would have access to the technology and image database . " currently , investigations tend to focus on trying to seize computers , forensically examine the hard drive and obtain the evidence to prosecute for possession or distribution -lrb- of child pornography -rrb- , " mcculloch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet pornography is easily accessible but the efforts are often in vain as many countries have n't pushed for identifying and prosecuting child sex abusers .
therefore , the focus must be on identifying the victims , mcculloch said . " once you 've identified the victim , you 've identified the abuser .
the vast majority is identified through the victims , " he said .
interpol has built up a databank of hundreds of thousands of images of child porn victims and as a result has managed to rescue at least several hundred children . analyzing crime scenes leads to finding victims the specialized software , however , not only helps to identify victims , but also crime scenes .
in one famous case , interpol analyzed the photo of a young girl found on a computer in the united states and linked it to four pictures from belgium .
the software was able to determine that the four different children shown separately had been photographed in the same room because it had recognized the wallpaper pattern in the background .
investigators eventually traced the victims and found the abuser . according to the international children 's watchdog agency ecpat , based in bangkok , most child pornography is exchanged for free online .
however , it has also sparked an underground business worth billions of dollars that distributes millions of images of child sex abuse . despite the new detection software , police are hard-pressed to keep up with other technological developments .
digital cameras , web sites and e-mail make it easy for computer users to circulate any images they want . ecpat says half of the images of child abuse sold online come from the united states , and another quarter comes from russia .
the agency is calling for tougher laws that would require internet providers to monitor for sexual photos of children . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vast police probe pursues child porn police across europe swooped down on dozens of locations and arrested more than 20 suspects in a vast operation against an online child pornography network , the largest of its kind coordinated by europol .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note " love never goes out of fashion " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.02.2006 european films the must-have item at berlinale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " dark , gloomy , german ... we 'll take it ! "
european indie films are top of the shopping lists the movie stars , the gliterring premieres ... it 's the public face of the berlinale film festival .
but behind the scenes , the hard bargaining happens .
this year , the must-have item for distributors is edgy european cinema . for ten days in february , paparazzi and film fans alike take over marlene dietrich platz in downtown berlin .
the reason ?
berlinale - germany ’ s largest international film festival .
with 400 movies , the first of europe 's three major film festivals is bigger than ever , showing everything from hollywood blockbusters to art house debuts from lesser-known artists . but what has grown most in recent years is the berlinale 's european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- .
since competitor mifed stopped operating in milan , italy , last autumn and the american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moved from april to november , the european film market has become one of the most important events on the industry calendar . it 's the only market worldwide which takes place within the framework of a film-festival .
and among the world ’ s biggest international film festivals , the berlinale is unique .
it 's not just for invited guests and professionals , but is also open to the public . in the berlinale 's 30 cinemas , world premieres test a film ’ s potential success with critics and an international audience alike .
on tuesday , iranian director rafi pitts screened his new film " zemestan – it 's winter " which is competing for the berlinale 's golden bear prize this year . " for any film - whether iranian or not - a podium like berlin obviously is beautiful , " pitts said .
" because it helps art exist .
if you work in art house cinema , how else are you going to get people to find out about it ?
how else are you going to give that podium for smaller distributors to be helped and they release it .
so it 's a question to tell the world that the film exists . " the place to pick up quality european indies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european indies are drawing in the crowds at berlinale this year although hollywood blockbusters are also featured in berlin , their distribution and public relations deals were made long ago as part of their financing .
in berlin , the berlinale 's six sections mainly focus on art house cinema . and it 's at the european film market that the independent scene 's new releases are promoted and international distribution rights are negotiated . " this year we have a selection of 625 films coming from i think 48 countries , " said efm-director beki probst .
" we have a lot of american independents ; we are still going on with the straight-from-sundance program .
we have , of course , a lot of european films , also of course german films .
and we do have a lot of films from asia . " the efm is a real chance for independent films to find a wider audience .
edgy german competition-entry " elementary particles " became a market hit last week .
distributor celluloid dreams sold the adaptation of michel houellebecq 's book to distributors in 23 countries – all within 24 hours of the film 's berlinale debut . german films , actors and directors in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german film " elementary particles " has made a big splash " i think that there 's really something spectacular happening with the german cinema at the moment , " enthused beki probst .
such resurgence is good news for the german box office which is sorely in need of a boost .
like most of europe , cinema admissions were down last year in germany to 21.5 million , a slump from the 36.7 million of the previous year . but this year , traders are paying particular attention to new german actors , young directors and their films .
the diversity in style and content has never been broader .
this year 's berlinale is showcasing 55 local films in all , including four in the festival 's main competition . europe looks to the future with funding initiative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of european films will hopefully boost ticket sales in 2006 with more than 700 films now being produced each year in europe , a new think tank was launched at the european film market this week by the danish film institute .
" if we want to promote european films and make sure the 1.5 billion euros spent on supporting european films are used correctly , we should use funding more effectively , " the institute said . european film makers are hoping that the discussions find a way to better support their products and to allow artists to bring their visions to life and to the market place at places like the berlinale . peter zimmermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale applauds german film about rapist a film about a rapist 's attempts to escape his past at the berlinale upholds the film festival 's reputation for dealing with wrenching subjects .

" -lrb- wednesday 's -rrb- decision ... was taken in light of the rapid spread of avian influenza over the past months and the current high risk of the disease spreading further , " said the european commission in a statement . so far , the h5n1 virus - which in its highly pathogenic form can be fatal to humans - has been detected within europe in austria , bulgaria , croatia , germany , greece , italy , romania , slovenia and ukraine . health commissioner marko kyprianou , attending the two days of talks with health experts from eu member states , underlined that there is unlikely to be an early end to the cases of bird flu . " given that the spring migration will begin soon we will review again the situation to see if there 's need for additional methods ...
we should n't be surprised if we have more migratory wild birds with this virus , " he said . " there 's no need to panic , " he warned .
" we have to advise the european public to stay calm ... there 's no reason not to consume chicken . " the potentially lethal h5n1 strain has killed at least 90 people - almost half those who caught it - mostly in southeast asia and china where it first erupted but also in turkey and northern iraq . eu fears transmission of virus into human food chain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission said that the consumption of chicken is not a threat , at the moment the big fear in the eu - which is the world 's third biggest exporter of poultry after the united states and brazil - is that the virus passes from migratory swans to chickens , or other birds in the human food chain . the avian virus , first reported on europe 's southeastern flanks in early january , re-erupted with a vengeance last week , starting in italy and greece but now with almost daily cases in a string of european countries . in germany , authorities wednesday set up the now-standard 10-kilometer -lrb- six-mile -rrb- surveillance zone around the site where the dead wild swans were found on the island of rügen in the baltic sea . hours later hungary confirmed that it had detected the h5-type virus in the bodies of three dead swans in the south of the country . bloc admits it is powerless to stop the disease arriving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nothing can be done to prevent migratory birds landing in europe as the eu scrambles , some underline that there is basically little it can do to prevent the disease arriving .
" we have absolutely no control over the introduction of the virus by migratory birds that are about to start returning from africa to siberia , scandinavia and greenland , " said french food safety agency panelist jean hars .
" it is unavoidable , " he told reporters . until recently , the eu has said it is satisfied that the measures taken are sufficient . but brussels is closely monitoring the situation and if poultry should become infected , it may call for the culling of all birds and eggs on small holdings or farms .
in addition the european commission has proposed speeding up the process of clamping down on new outbreaks , by making arrangements automatic rather than on a case-by-case basis . experts assess " minimum risk " to poultry flocks meanwhile , health experts said wednesday that migrant birds carrying the virus appear to pose only a limited risk to western europe 's poultry flocks . in contrast to asia and africa , where chickens , ducks and geese raised for the pot are generally grown in open fields and farmyards , most of the european union 's poultry spends its life in large , enclosed sheds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized farms stand a good chance of remianing virus-free " migrating birds do not come into contact with fowl in these industrialized farms , so this is reassuring , " said jeanne brugere-picoux , a professor at the alfort veterinary school near paris and a pathologist in bird diseases .
" but precautions still have to be taken .
migrating birds are a risk , although the risk is more specifically for farmyard fowl which live out in the open and for domestic ducks , " she said . julian hughes , head of species conservation at the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- in britain , said the biggest potential source of transmission was in ponds , lakes or wetlands .
" the virus can be transmitted through a variety of ways , " he told reporters . " we know that the virus stays active within feces and in water for several days after it 's been shed from the bird .
but another route which is just as likely is direct contact , through nasal and bodily fluids , through the bill or the nose . ” " ducks and geese congregate in large numbers , thousands of them together .
they all feed together and when they roost at night , they tend to roost together in the middle of the water , so they are in pretty close contact . " spread attributed in part to movement of diseased poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range diseased poultry pose just as much threat as migratory birds hughes said it was quite possible that migrating birds could pick up the virus from infected poultry , rather than the other way round .
and he called for a sense of proportion , noting that outbreaks of bird flu were chiefly caused by the movement of diseased poultry , not wildlife . " the danger is that if everyone talks and concentrates on migratory birds , then bio-security measures get neglected , " he said . trying to stamp out h5n1 in wild birds through culls " is going to be entirely ineffective , because there are millions of birds on the move , " he said .

" -lrb- wednesday 's -rrb- decision ... was taken in light of the rapid spread of avian influenza over the past months and the current high risk of the disease spreading further , " said the european commission in a statement . so far , the h5n1 virus - which in its highly pathogenic form can be fatal to humans - has been detected within europe in austria , bulgaria , croatia , germany , greece , italy , romania , slovenia and ukraine . health commissioner marko kyprianou , attending the two days of talks with health experts from eu member states , underlined that there is unlikely to be an early end to the cases of bird flu . " given that the spring migration will begin soon we will review again the situation to see if there 's need for additional methods ...
we should n't be surprised if we have more migratory wild birds with this virus , " he said . " there 's no need to panic , " he warned .
" we have to advise the european public to stay calm ... there 's no reason not to consume chicken . " the potentially lethal h5n1 strain has killed at least 90 people - almost half those who caught it - mostly in southeast asia and china where it first erupted but also in turkey and northern iraq . eu fears transmission of virus into human food chain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission said that the consumption of chicken is not a threat , at the moment the big fear in the eu - which is the world 's third biggest exporter of poultry after the united states and brazil - is that the virus passes from migratory swans to chickens , or other birds in the human food chain . the avian virus , first reported on europe 's southeastern flanks in early january , re-erupted with a vengeance last week , starting in italy and greece but now with almost daily cases in a string of european countries . in germany , authorities wednesday set up the now-standard 10-kilometer -lrb- six-mile -rrb- surveillance zone around the site where the dead wild swans were found on the island of rügen in the baltic sea . hours later hungary confirmed that it had detected the h5-type virus in the bodies of three dead swans in the south of the country . bloc admits it is powerless to stop the disease arriving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nothing can be done to prevent migratory birds landing in europe as the eu scrambles , some underline that there is basically little it can do to prevent the disease arriving .
" we have absolutely no control over the introduction of the virus by migratory birds that are about to start returning from africa to siberia , scandinavia and greenland , " said french food safety agency panelist jean hars .
" it is unavoidable , " he told reporters . until recently , the eu has said it is satisfied that the measures taken are sufficient . but brussels is closely monitoring the situation and if poultry should become infected , it may call for the culling of all birds and eggs on small holdings or farms .
in addition the european commission has proposed speeding up the process of clamping down on new outbreaks , by making arrangements automatic rather than on a case-by-case basis . experts assess " minimum risk " to poultry flocks meanwhile , health experts said wednesday that migrant birds carrying the virus appear to pose only a limited risk to western europe 's poultry flocks . in contrast to asia and africa , where chickens , ducks and geese raised for the pot are generally grown in open fields and farmyards , most of the european union 's poultry spends its life in large , enclosed sheds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized farms stand a good chance of remianing virus-free " migrating birds do not come into contact with fowl in these industrialized farms , so this is reassuring , " said jeanne brugere-picoux , a professor at the alfort veterinary school near paris and a pathologist in bird diseases .
" but precautions still have to be taken .
migrating birds are a risk , although the risk is more specifically for farmyard fowl which live out in the open and for domestic ducks , " she said . julian hughes , head of species conservation at the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- in britain , said the biggest potential source of transmission was in ponds , lakes or wetlands .
" the virus can be transmitted through a variety of ways , " he told reporters . " we know that the virus stays active within feces and in water for several days after it 's been shed from the bird .
but another route which is just as likely is direct contact , through nasal and bodily fluids , through the bill or the nose . ” " ducks and geese congregate in large numbers , thousands of them together .
they all feed together and when they roost at night , they tend to roost together in the middle of the water , so they are in pretty close contact . " spread attributed in part to movement of diseased poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range diseased poultry pose just as much threat as migratory birds hughes said it was quite possible that migrating birds could pick up the virus from infected poultry , rather than the other way round .
and he called for a sense of proportion , noting that outbreaks of bird flu were chiefly caused by the movement of diseased poultry , not wildlife . " the danger is that if everyone talks and concentrates on migratory birds , then bio-security measures get neglected , " he said . trying to stamp out h5n1 in wild birds through culls " is going to be entirely ineffective , because there are millions of birds on the move , " he said .

one german state has decided to heed the call . bavaria makes no bones about the importance of its cultural identity , in which local language plays a particularly important role .
it should , therefore , come as little surprise that the sprawling southern state should be the first to launch a targeted initiative to reignite regional passions for its spoken heritage now deemed to be threatened by extinction .
earlier this month , the bavarian culture ministry presented a grand plan to help prevent its dialects from falling prey to linguistic evolution and the long arm of globalization .
the idea is to provide schools , both primary and secondary , with teaching material which would facilitate the integration of local dialects into regular classes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linguistic snobbery should become a thing of the past harald niedermair , a spokesman for the culture ministry , said one of the main aims of the project is to stamp out the stigma which is still attached to being a dialect speaker .
" even today , there are people who view local dialects as an inferior means of communication .
we want to prevent a situation in which pupils are excluded simply because of the way they speak . "
dialect no deficit niedermair said the proposed model , which could incorporate local dialects into subjects as diverse as theater , geography , music and math , promotes the virtue in being able to speak a second language , even if one of them is restricted to a relatively small geographical area .
" we want to support children 's ability for bilingualism , to show that it is something positive rather than a deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how bavarian are they once they start to speak ?
dialectologist bernhard stör agreed it was important to encourage children to speak in dialect , but said the culture ministry 's proposals do n't get to the root of the problem .
" as long as the general public views local dialect as a negative thing , the ministerial guidelines for teachers are nothing short of ridiculous . "
he said that schools ca n't be expected to influence the situation unless 50 percent of teaching is conducted in dialect .
too much too soon stör said dialects have been fighting a losing battle since the 1960s , when it became fashionable for children to tone down their indigenous tongues to remove any obstructions along the path to learning the purer " high german " considered the key to a successful future .
" the general idea back then was that if children were having to learn both their dialect and german , they were being exposed to unnecessary confusion , " stör said .
but that belief has now been proven untrue .
" new research , however , shows that the sooner they start , the easier it is for children to absorb other languages in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich skyline that said , demographic evolution in bavaria has been such over the past decades that there are simply fewer dialect speakers to spread the word .
from the postwar era to the present day , the population of the bavarian capital , munich , has grown from half a million to almost 2.5 million inhabitants , but far from all of them can speak a local dialect .
" only four percent of greater munich residents under the age of 25 have so much as a passive understanding of the old bavarian dialect , " stör said .
although further out of town the numbers are a little higher , unless something is done to reverse the trend , it is only a matter of time before the city mentality reaches the countryside , he said .
too uncool for words " cities are always the linguistic frontrunners , " stör said , adding that the feeling among youngsters in munich is that dialect is simply uncool .
" children have absorbed the mentality of their parents , and often equate dialects with being dumb .
they think that if they want to get anywhere in their professional lives , they can not be seen to be speaking anything other than high german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr bavarian , edmund stoiber ?
and therein lies the catch .
for , as things stand , it is easier to get a job in numerous branches , including tourism and media , if you do n't bring a thick accent along to the interview .
stör said the responsibility for changing that lies with those in the public eye .
he cited franz beckenbauer and edmund stoiber as personalities who could , simply by using their mother tongue , convince bavarians that they do n't have to give up on their linguistic heritage to stand a chance of leading a successful professional life inside or outside bavaria 's borders . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese etiquette lessons for germany china 's economic boom has triggered a burgeoning travel industry .

one german state has decided to heed the call . bavaria makes no bones about the importance of its cultural identity , in which local language plays a particularly important role .
it should , therefore , come as little surprise that the sprawling southern state should be the first to launch a targeted initiative to reignite regional passions for its spoken heritage now deemed to be threatened by extinction .
earlier this month , the bavarian culture ministry presented a grand plan to help prevent its dialects from falling prey to linguistic evolution and the long arm of globalization .
the idea is to provide schools , both primary and secondary , with teaching material which would facilitate the integration of local dialects into regular classes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linguistic snobbery should become a thing of the past harald niedermair , a spokesman for the culture ministry , said one of the main aims of the project is to stamp out the stigma which is still attached to being a dialect speaker .
" even today , there are people who view local dialects as an inferior means of communication .
we want to prevent a situation in which pupils are excluded simply because of the way they speak . "
dialect no deficit niedermair said the proposed model , which could incorporate local dialects into subjects as diverse as theater , geography , music and math , promotes the virtue in being able to speak a second language , even if one of them is restricted to a relatively small geographical area .
" we want to support children 's ability for bilingualism , to show that it is something positive rather than a deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how bavarian are they once they start to speak ?
dialectologist bernhard stör agreed it was important to encourage children to speak in dialect , but said the culture ministry 's proposals do n't get to the root of the problem .
" as long as the general public views local dialect as a negative thing , the ministerial guidelines for teachers are nothing short of ridiculous . "
he said that schools ca n't be expected to influence the situation unless 50 percent of teaching is conducted in dialect .
too much too soon stör said dialects have been fighting a losing battle since the 1960s , when it became fashionable for children to tone down their indigenous tongues to remove any obstructions along the path to learning the purer " high german " considered the key to a successful future .
" the general idea back then was that if children were having to learn both their dialect and german , they were being exposed to unnecessary confusion , " stör said .
but that belief has now been proven untrue .
" new research , however , shows that the sooner they start , the easier it is for children to absorb other languages in the future . "

but come summer , he is hoping belis , his prague-based company , will have more work than ever thanks to a european parliament decision to open the bloc 's service sector . " we can sell swimming pools with our technology to germany but can not install them - that is really slowing us down , " he said , adding that he sold about 60 pools to germans last year .
" we would happily go and install our products for two days or longer and then go back home . " a 394-215 decision by eu lawmakers on thursday will get horn a step closer to having his own employees setting up pools across europe by knocking down nearly all of the national barriers that keep companies from one member state from offering their services in another eu country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horn said his workers want to install pools then go home " a foundation of the eu is the free movement of good and workers , " horn said .
" now we are in the eu , and our goods can move freely , but there still is not any movement in the labor force . " some fears and resistance remain not everyone in europe is happy to see the service sector expand .
on tuesday more than 20,000 people demonstrated against the plan , arguing it would lead to declining standards , lower wages and job losses , especially in the " older " eu member states . " it is not time for opening up services , above all when you have no rules for social harmonization and public services , " said french socialist pervenche beres .
" we ca n't accept the exclusion of social policy and consumer protection from the directive 's scope . " the approved directive requires companies adhere to the host nation 's laws , not their home-country requirements , a provision that previously led to the rejection of similar proposals as a number of eu states feared a flood of cheap migrant workers would undercut local businesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands took to the streets of strasbourg to protest the proposed directive horn , however , said he is prepared to meet each country 's conditions but was being held back by lengthy licensing procedures designed to protect local workers every time he wants to send his employees abroad . only britain , ireland and sweden opened their borders to foreign workers when the eu expanded to 25 members in may 2004 and are profiting from influx of workers while other nations continue to require work permits or have quotas in place to ward off mass migration , according to a eu report . no flood of migrant workers " membership in the eu does not trigger migration , " industry commissioner günter verheugen , the architect of the eu 's enlargement , told the press .
" on the contrary , -lrb- it -rrb- is a strong incentive to stay home and to try to improve living conditions there because there is new hope . " now horn said he is hoping the european commission and member states , which both need to approve the recently passed bill before it becomes binding , will quickly put their support behind the proposal so he can help non-czech 's cool off this summer . " drive there , install the product and come back - that 's the mentality of our employees , " he said .
" they will do that two or three times a month , but no one is interested in leaving their family for half a year at a time - they do n't even want to move to another place in the czech republic for work .

one german state has decided to heed the call . bavaria makes no bones about the importance of its cultural identity , in which local language plays a particularly important role .
it should , therefore , come as little surprise that the sprawling southern state should be the first to launch a targeted initiative to reignite regional passions for its spoken heritage now deemed to be threatened by extinction .
earlier this month , the bavarian culture ministry presented a grand plan to help prevent its dialects from falling prey to linguistic evolution and the long arm of globalization .
the idea is to provide schools , both primary and secondary , with teaching material which would facilitate the integration of local dialects into regular classes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linguistic snobbery should become a thing of the past harald niedermair , a spokesman for the culture ministry , said one of the main aims of the project is to stamp out the stigma which is still attached to being a dialect speaker .
" even today , there are people who view local dialects as an inferior means of communication .
we want to prevent a situation in which pupils are excluded simply because of the way they speak . "
dialect no deficit niedermair said the proposed model , which could incorporate local dialects into subjects as diverse as theater , geography , music and math , promotes the virtue in being able to speak a second language , even if one of them is restricted to a relatively small geographical area .
" we want to support children 's ability for bilingualism , to show that it is something positive rather than a deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how bavarian are they once they start to speak ?
dialectologist bernhard stör agreed it was important to encourage children to speak in dialect , but said the culture ministry 's proposals do n't get to the root of the problem .
" as long as the general public views local dialect as a negative thing , the ministerial guidelines for teachers are nothing short of ridiculous . "
he said that schools ca n't be expected to influence the situation unless 50 percent of teaching is conducted in dialect .
too much too soon stör said dialects have been fighting a losing battle since the 1960s , when it became fashionable for children to tone down their indigenous tongues to remove any obstructions along the path to learning the purer " high german " considered the key to a successful future .
" the general idea back then was that if children were having to learn both their dialect and german , they were being exposed to unnecessary confusion , " stör said .
but that belief has now been proven untrue .
" new research , however , shows that the sooner they start , the easier it is for children to absorb other languages in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich skyline that said , demographic evolution in bavaria has been such over the past decades that there are simply fewer dialect speakers to spread the word .
from the postwar era to the present day , the population of the bavarian capital , munich , has grown from half a million to almost 2.5 million inhabitants , but far from all of them can speak a local dialect .
" only four percent of greater munich residents under the age of 25 have so much as a passive understanding of the old bavarian dialect , " stör said .
although further out of town the numbers are a little higher , unless something is done to reverse the trend , it is only a matter of time before the city mentality reaches the countryside , he said .
too uncool for words " cities are always the linguistic frontrunners , " stör said , adding that the feeling among youngsters in munich is that dialect is simply uncool .
" children have absorbed the mentality of their parents , and often equate dialects with being dumb .
they think that if they want to get anywhere in their professional lives , they can not be seen to be speaking anything other than high german .

and therein lies the catch .
for , as things stand , it is easier to get a job in numerous branches , including tourism and media , if you do n't bring a thick accent along to the interview .
stör said the responsibility for changing that lies with those in the public eye .
he cited franz beckenbauer and edmund stoiber as personalities who could , simply by using their mother tongue , convince bavarians that they do n't have to give up on their linguistic heritage to stand a chance of leading a successful professional life inside or outside bavaria 's borders . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese etiquette lessons for germany china 's economic boom has triggered a burgeoning travel industry .

one german state has decided to heed the call . bavaria makes no bones about the importance of its cultural identity , in which local language plays a particularly important role .
it should , therefore , come as little surprise that the sprawling southern state should be the first to launch a targeted initiative to reignite regional passions for its spoken heritage now deemed to be threatened by extinction .
earlier this month , the bavarian culture ministry presented a grand plan to help prevent its dialects from falling prey to linguistic evolution and the long arm of globalization .
the idea is to provide schools , both primary and secondary , with teaching material which would facilitate the integration of local dialects into regular classes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linguistic snobbery should become a thing of the past harald niedermair , a spokesman for the culture ministry , said one of the main aims of the project is to stamp out the stigma which is still attached to being a dialect speaker .
" even today , there are people who view local dialects as an inferior means of communication .
we want to prevent a situation in which pupils are excluded simply because of the way they speak . "
dialect no deficit niedermair said the proposed model , which could incorporate local dialects into subjects as diverse as theater , geography , music and math , promotes the virtue in being able to speak a second language , even if one of them is restricted to a relatively small geographical area .
" we want to support children 's ability for bilingualism , to show that it is something positive rather than a deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how bavarian are they once they start to speak ?
dialectologist bernhard stör agreed it was important to encourage children to speak in dialect , but said the culture ministry 's proposals do n't get to the root of the problem .
" as long as the general public views local dialect as a negative thing , the ministerial guidelines for teachers are nothing short of ridiculous . "

but come summer , he is hoping belis , his prague-based company , will have more work than ever thanks to a european parliament decision to open the bloc 's service sector . " we can sell swimming pools with our technology to germany but can not install them - that is really slowing us down , " he said , adding that he sold about 60 pools to germans last year .
" we would happily go and install our products for two days or longer and then go back home . " a 394-215 decision by eu lawmakers on thursday will get horn a step closer to having his own employees setting up pools across europe by knocking down nearly all of the national barriers that keep companies from one member state from offering their services in another eu country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horn said his workers want to install pools then go home " a foundation of the eu is the free movement of good and workers , " horn said .
" now we are in the eu , and our goods can move freely , but there still is not any movement in the labor force . " some fears and resistance remain not everyone in europe is happy to see the service sector expand .
on tuesday more than 20,000 people demonstrated against the plan , arguing it would lead to declining standards , lower wages and job losses , especially in the " older " eu member states . " it is not time for opening up services , above all when you have no rules for social harmonization and public services , " said french socialist pervenche beres .
" we ca n't accept the exclusion of social policy and consumer protection from the directive 's scope . " the approved directive requires companies adhere to the host nation 's laws , not their home-country requirements , a provision that previously led to the rejection of similar proposals as a number of eu states feared a flood of cheap migrant workers would undercut local businesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands took to the streets of strasbourg to protest the proposed directive horn , however , said he is prepared to meet each country 's conditions but was being held back by lengthy licensing procedures designed to protect local workers every time he wants to send his employees abroad . only britain , ireland and sweden opened their borders to foreign workers when the eu expanded to 25 members in may 2004 and are profiting from influx of workers while other nations continue to require work permits or have quotas in place to ward off mass migration , according to a eu report . no flood of migrant workers " membership in the eu does not trigger migration , " industry commissioner günter verheugen , the architect of the eu 's enlargement , told the press .
" on the contrary , -lrb- it -rrb- is a strong incentive to stay home and to try to improve living conditions there because there is new hope . " now horn said he is hoping the european commission and member states , which both need to approve the recently passed bill before it becomes binding , will quickly put their support behind the proposal so he can help non-czech 's cool off this summer . " drive there , install the product and come back - that 's the mentality of our employees , " he said .
" they will do that two or three times a month , but no one is interested in leaving their family for half a year at a time - they do n't even want to move to another place in the czech republic for work .

"
european indie films are top of the shopping lists the movie stars , the gliterring premieres ... it 's the public face of the berlinale film festival .
but behind the scenes , the hard bargaining happens .
this year , the must-have item for distributors is edgy european cinema . for ten days in february , paparazzi and film fans alike take over marlene dietrich platz in downtown berlin .
the reason ?
berlinale - germany ’ s largest international film festival .
with 400 movies , the first of europe 's three major film festivals is bigger than ever , showing everything from hollywood blockbusters to art house debuts from lesser-known artists . but what has grown most in recent years is the berlinale 's european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- .
since competitor mifed stopped operating in milan , italy , last autumn and the american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moved from april to november , the european film market has become one of the most important events on the industry calendar . it 's the only market worldwide which takes place within the framework of a film-festival .
and among the world ’ s biggest international film festivals , the berlinale is unique .
it 's not just for invited guests and professionals , but is also open to the public . in the berlinale 's 30 cinemas , world premieres test a film ’ s potential success with critics and an international audience alike .
on tuesday , iranian director rafi pitts screened his new film " zemestan – it 's winter " which is competing for the berlinale 's golden bear prize this year . " for any film - whether iranian or not - a podium like berlin obviously is beautiful , " pitts said .
" because it helps art exist .
if you work in art house cinema , how else are you going to get people to find out about it ?
how else are you going to give that podium for smaller distributors to be helped and they release it .
so it 's a question to tell the world that the film exists . " the place to pick up quality european indies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european indies are drawing in the crowds at berlinale this year although hollywood blockbusters are also featured in berlin , their distribution and public relations deals were made long ago as part of their financing .
in berlin , the berlinale 's six sections mainly focus on art house cinema . and it 's at the european film market that the independent scene 's new releases are promoted and international distribution rights are negotiated . " this year we have a selection of 625 films coming from i think 48 countries , " said efm-director beki probst .
" we have a lot of american independents ; we are still going on with the straight-from-sundance program .
we have , of course , a lot of european films , also of course german films .
and we do have a lot of films from asia . " the efm is a real chance for independent films to find a wider audience .
edgy german competition-entry " elementary particles " became a market hit last week .
distributor celluloid dreams sold the adaptation of michel houellebecq 's book to distributors in 23 countries – all within 24 hours of the film 's berlinale debut . german films , actors and directors in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german film " elementary particles " has made a big splash " i think that there 's really something spectacular happening with the german cinema at the moment , " enthused beki probst .
such resurgence is good news for the german box office which is sorely in need of a boost .
like most of europe , cinema admissions were down last year in germany to 21.5 million , a slump from the 36.7 million of the previous year . but this year , traders are paying particular attention to new german actors , young directors and their films .
the diversity in style and content has never been broader .
this year 's berlinale is showcasing 55 local films in all , including four in the festival 's main competition . europe looks to the future with funding initiative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of european films will hopefully boost ticket sales in 2006 with more than 700 films now being produced each year in europe , a new think tank was launched at the european film market this week by the danish film institute .
" if we want to promote european films and make sure the 1.5 billion euros spent on supporting european films are used correctly , we should use funding more effectively , " the institute said . european film makers are hoping that the discussions find a way to better support their products and to allow artists to bring their visions to life and to the market place at places like the berlinale . peter zimmermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale applauds german film about rapist a film about a rapist 's attempts to escape his past at the berlinale upholds the film festival 's reputation for dealing with wrenching subjects .

" it is a sub-type of h5n1 , which first appeared among poultry in china last year , " seehofer said in a speech carried on german television .
" even with the most rigorous action we can not assume that we will overcome this matter in a few weeks . " " given the worldwide spread of this virus , we are expecting more cases in germany , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer urged citizens to remain calm in the face of the outbreak seehofer 's agriculture ministry issued a ban on keeping poultry out of doors on wednesday , bringing the action forward to feb .
17 after the ministry had changed the date to feb .

european lawmakers approved a hotly contested plan to open the bloc 's vast service sector thursday .
the plan enjoys the support of the eu 's two largest parties , but some smaller groups are unhappy with the deal . the proposed directive , which the european commission originally put on the table in 2004 , aims to create a european service market free of most administrative and political obstacles currently holding back service providers from setting up shop in other member states .
supporters also hope it will generate much-needed jobs in the 25-nation bloc . " we can now move on to focus on the delivery of real economic benefits for consumers and companies , " said eurodeputy malcom harbour , who worked on the text on behalf of the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , the biggest political group in the parliament . the services sector is responsible for half the economic activity in the eu and 60 percent of its jobs .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said reforms are essential for spurring employment and growth in europe 's long-flagging economy . the directive , which still needs to be approved by the european commission and member states , would cover any service not explicitly excluded or covered by other eu-wide legislation .

european lawmakers approved a hotly contested plan to open the bloc 's vast service sector thursday .
the plan enjoys the support of the eu 's two largest parties , but some smaller groups are unhappy with the deal . the proposed directive , which the european commission originally put on the table in 2004 , aims to create a european service market free of most administrative and political obstacles currently holding back service providers from setting up shop in other member states .
supporters also hope it will generate much-needed jobs in the 25-nation bloc . " we can now move on to focus on the delivery of real economic benefits for consumers and companies , " said eurodeputy malcom harbour , who worked on the text on behalf of the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , the biggest political group in the parliament . the services sector is responsible for half the economic activity in the eu and 60 percent of its jobs .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said reforms are essential for spurring employment and growth in europe 's long-flagging economy . the directive , which still needs to be approved by the european commission and member states , would cover any service not explicitly excluded or covered by other eu-wide legislation .

european lawmakers approved a hotly contested plan to open the bloc 's vast service sector thursday .
the plan enjoys the support of the eu 's two largest parties , but some smaller groups are unhappy with the deal . the proposed directive , which the european commission originally put on the table in 2004 , aims to create a european service market free of most administrative and political obstacles currently holding back service providers from setting up shop in other member states .
supporters also hope it will generate much-needed jobs in the 25-nation bloc . " we can now move on to focus on the delivery of real economic benefits for consumers and companies , " said eurodeputy malcom harbour , who worked on the text on behalf of the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , the biggest political group in the parliament . the services sector is responsible for half the economic activity in the eu and 60 percent of its jobs .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said reforms are essential for spurring employment and growth in europe 's long-flagging economy . the directive , which still needs to be approved by the european commission and member states , would cover any service not explicitly excluded or covered by other eu-wide legislation .
catering , advertising , architects , the construction industry , accountants , hairdressing and the computer industry would all be covered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when they finish , these students could offer their services across europe the epp and the socialists , the parliament 's two largest parties , agreed health care and social services such as social housing and childcare would be excluded as well as services like education that are provided directly by the state . in order to reach a compromise before thursday 's vote , the parties watered down the proposal to allow member states to bar service providers for a number of reasons , provided the intervention is non-discriminatory . companies to follow host nation 's laws " what we 've got now is a directive which very clearly will promote opening markets , reduce red tape and facilitate cooperation , " german social democrat evelyne gebhardt told journalists .
" at the same time , i think it takes account of the rights of workers and consumers . " the deal , which passed by a 394-215 margin , will allow companies to provide their services across the eu , but require them to adhere to the labor , health , safety and environmental standards of the host country .
previous versions of the bill , which allowed companies to follow the standards of their home country , met with stiff resistance . the bill 's opponents , including germany , france and austria , fear an influx of cheap labor - epitomized by " polish plumbers " willing to work longer for less pay - would undercut local competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child care is one of the services the compromise would not open changes needed to push competition free market supporters , such as britain and the eu 's new east european member states , have said the directive is necessary to increase competition across the union . the agreed upon proposal , however , is too weak for some proponents .
epp vice-president and hungarian parliamentarian józsef szájer wrote in wednesday 's financial times that he thought a majority for a broader proposal could still be found and called on lawmakers to vote against the compromise . " if the number and extent of excuses for states to control service providers from other member states grows beyond the present situation , the original rationale of the draft directive is lost , " he wrote .
" if the text ends up according to last week 's compromise , it is better to vote against it , than support a directive that creates new obstacles and freezes europe 's services market for 30 more years . " the eu parliament was eager to produce a broad majority so that member states , who are themselves deeply divided on the issue , will not be tempted to veer from its text when it is the governments ' turn to look at the package . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to put service sector reform to the test plans to throw open europe 's vast services sector to tougher competition faces a crunch week as the european parliament prepares to vote on hotly contested new legislation .

dr. stefanie ritz-timme of the institute for forensic medicine in düsseldorf helped create the software and said it is the first of its kind . scientists and police hope to refine the software enough to be able to scan the massive amounts of image data that investigators routinely confiscate .
the software would automatically filter out images of children from older people , thereby relieving police of having to do the job manually .
the german criminal police office is collaborating with the team of forensic scientists and anthropologists - from germany , italy and lithuania - in the further development of the program .
the european union is also sponsoring the project with one million euros . the program is fast to spot a child bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric scanner identifies facial features the program currently requires just two minutes to classify an image of a face by age .
when the software scans an image databank , it can weed out illegal child pornography from permitted adult pornography found on the internet . for the specialized software to work , facial patterns must first be " logged " into the program .
the research team thus photographed the faces of 600 german , italian and lithuanian children and entered their facial characteristics into the program .
the researchers intend to photograph another 1,650 children and young people to enhance the software 's detection capabilities . different types of software help police trace victims while the computer program 's ability to pinpoint facial characteristics specific to children is new , computer software to hunt down child porn traffickers is not .
in september 2005 , the international criminal police organization interpol announced it would launch a major campaign to identify child sex victims and prosecute abusers with the help of special software . the software is supposed to minutely analyze pornographic material on the internet and spot key background clues .
according to reuters news agency , hamish mcculloch - an interpol official - said police around the world would have access to the technology and image database . " currently , investigations tend to focus on trying to seize computers , forensically examine the hard drive and obtain the evidence to prosecute for possession or distribution -lrb- of child pornography -rrb- , " mcculloch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet pornography is easily accessible but the efforts are often in vain as many countries have n't pushed for identifying and prosecuting child sex abusers .
therefore , the focus must be on identifying the victims , mcculloch said . " once you 've identified the victim , you 've identified the abuser .
the vast majority is identified through the victims , " he said .
interpol has built up a databank of hundreds of thousands of images of child porn victims and as a result has managed to rescue at least several hundred children . analyzing crime scenes leads to finding victims the specialized software , however , not only helps to identify victims , but also crime scenes .
in one famous case , interpol analyzed the photo of a young girl found on a computer in the united states and linked it to four pictures from belgium .
the software was able to determine that the four different children shown separately had been photographed in the same room because it had recognized the wallpaper pattern in the background .
investigators eventually traced the victims and found the abuser . according to the international children 's watchdog agency ecpat , based in bangkok , most child pornography is exchanged for free online .
however , it has also sparked an underground business worth billions of dollars that distributes millions of images of child sex abuse . despite the new detection software , police are hard-pressed to keep up with other technological developments .
digital cameras , web sites and e-mail make it easy for computer users to circulate any images they want . ecpat says half of the images of child abuse sold online come from the united states , and another quarter comes from russia .
the agency is calling for tougher laws that would require internet providers to monitor for sexual photos of children . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vast police probe pursues child porn police across europe swooped down on dozens of locations and arrested more than 20 suspects in a vast operation against an online child pornography network , the largest of its kind coordinated by europol .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note " love never goes out of fashion " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.02.2006 european films the must-have item at berlinale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " dark , gloomy , german ... we 'll take it ! "
european indie films are top of the shopping lists the movie stars , the gliterring premieres ... it 's the public face of the berlinale film festival .
but behind the scenes , the hard bargaining happens .
this year , the must-have item for distributors is edgy european cinema . for ten days in february , paparazzi and film fans alike take over marlene dietrich platz in downtown berlin .
the reason ?
berlinale - germany ’ s largest international film festival .
with 400 movies , the first of europe 's three major film festivals is bigger than ever , showing everything from hollywood blockbusters to art house debuts from lesser-known artists . but what has grown most in recent years is the berlinale 's european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- .
since competitor mifed stopped operating in milan , italy , last autumn and the american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moved from april to november , the european film market has become one of the most important events on the industry calendar . it 's the only market worldwide which takes place within the framework of a film-festival .
and among the world ’ s biggest international film festivals , the berlinale is unique .
it 's not just for invited guests and professionals , but is also open to the public . in the berlinale 's 30 cinemas , world premieres test a film ’ s potential success with critics and an international audience alike .
on tuesday , iranian director rafi pitts screened his new film " zemestan – it 's winter " which is competing for the berlinale 's golden bear prize this year . " for any film - whether iranian or not - a podium like berlin obviously is beautiful , " pitts said .
" because it helps art exist .
if you work in art house cinema , how else are you going to get people to find out about it ?
how else are you going to give that podium for smaller distributors to be helped and they release it .
so it 's a question to tell the world that the film exists . " the place to pick up quality european indies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european indies are drawing in the crowds at berlinale this year although hollywood blockbusters are also featured in berlin , their distribution and public relations deals were made long ago as part of their financing .
in berlin , the berlinale 's six sections mainly focus on art house cinema . and it 's at the european film market that the independent scene 's new releases are promoted and international distribution rights are negotiated . " this year we have a selection of 625 films coming from i think 48 countries , " said efm-director beki probst .
" we have a lot of american independents ; we are still going on with the straight-from-sundance program .
we have , of course , a lot of european films , also of course german films .
and we do have a lot of films from asia . " the efm is a real chance for independent films to find a wider audience .
edgy german competition-entry " elementary particles " became a market hit last week .
distributor celluloid dreams sold the adaptation of michel houellebecq 's book to distributors in 23 countries – all within 24 hours of the film 's berlinale debut . german films , actors and directors in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german film " elementary particles " has made a big splash " i think that there 's really something spectacular happening with the german cinema at the moment , " enthused beki probst .
such resurgence is good news for the german box office which is sorely in need of a boost .

the director says he is emphasizing loneliness , not rape , in the picture . " der freie wille , " or " the free will , " is the second entry in this year 's main competition to deal with the issue of rape .
the bosnian picture " grbavica " has also focused on the topic . a 15-minute scene showing a rape in horrifying detail forms the centerpiece of the german movie screened at the berlinale earlier this week . there will be few scenes committed to film this year more harrowing than the assault of a young woman on a windswept beach which explains how the main figure , theo , comes to serve more than nine years in a secure psychiatric unit . film focuses on an individual jürgen vogel , one of germany 's top actors and better known for comic roles , plays the convicted rapist theo .
he attempts to escape from the terrible longing within him and build a life with an unsuspecting girlfriend , nettie , portrayed by sabine timoteo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress sabine timoteo gives the harsh film a gentle side , says the director the plot skips straight to his life after detention , and his meeting with nettie .
she has suffered years of mental abuse from her divorced father . the blossoming relationship between theo and nettie , which is eventually consumed by his past , are the main subject matter of the 163-minute-long movie . " it is not a film about rape , it is about an individual , " director matthias glasner told a press conference after the screening earlier this week .
" i did n't want to show the treatment for a rapist , which is why there are no scenes of the therapy .
i wanted to show how life is for a rapist , what they feel . " glasner said he had shown the film to a girlfriend who had been raped . " at first , she did n't want to see it .
but when she did , she said it had removed the horror of the experience for her , " glasner said to a howl of objection from one of the assembled journalists . a film which courts controversy the brutality of the rape scenes means the film courts controversy - making it perfect for a festival that prides itself on grappling with issues others wo n't touch .
it relies on timoteo for any gentleness . " i have to say that i felt a lot of resistance to the plot to begin with , " timoteo said .
" my biggest challenge was to let that angst go .

could it force the transrapid consortium onto the holding track on the sought-after chinese market ? china is developing a model to compete with the german high-speed magnetic levitation train transrapid .
according to the german newspaper die welt , chinese researchers in shanghai already want to test their own version in july . the chinese model with the name zhui feng -lrb- hunt the wind -rrb- would reach speeds of 500 kilometers an hour -lrb- 310 mph -rrb- and therefore be as fast as the german transrapid . chief engineer zheng from the chengdu aircraft industry cooperation -lrb- cac -rrb- , which is developing the train , said cac was not simply copying transrapid . " the one we 're building is completely different from the german one , " said zheng , who is responsible for design and technology .
" basically , we do n't know that much about the german technology . " he said cac did n't use any german materials or plans . german transrapid has more advantages the only transrapid connection in the world links shanghai and its airport .
china is planning an extension of this connection to the city of hangzhou , 180 kilometers away . transrapid spokesman peter wiegelmann said the german train had a significant advantage compared to the chinese competition .
it has been in commercial use for three years and proven its dependability .
it has transported six million passengers already . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german transrapid consortium is hoping for an order from britain " that 's why we expect opportunities with the transrapid technology , " said wiegelmann .
the consortium , made up of thyssen , siemens und adtranz , was " optimistic " that it would win the contract for the new route in shanghai . " the most important thing now is munich though " wiegelmann said .
the transrapid consortium is pushing for speedy construction of the long-awaited airport connection in munich .
the project approval procedure is currently in process . the transrapid consortium also hopes for orders from the united states , britain and the middle east . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , beijing sign high-speed rail deal china said it had signed a cooperation agreement with germany 's transport ministry for joint development of high-speed rail technology .

" -lrb- wednesday 's -rrb- decision ... was taken in light of the rapid spread of avian influenza over the past months and the current high risk of the disease spreading further , " said the european commission in a statement . so far , the h5n1 virus - which in its highly pathogenic form can be fatal to humans - has been detected within europe in austria , bulgaria , croatia , germany , greece , italy , romania , slovenia and ukraine . health commissioner marko kyprianou , attending the two days of talks with health experts from eu member states , underlined that there is unlikely to be an early end to the cases of bird flu . " given that the spring migration will begin soon we will review again the situation to see if there 's need for additional methods ...
we should n't be surprised if we have more migratory wild birds with this virus , " he said . " there 's no need to panic , " he warned .
" we have to advise the european public to stay calm ... there 's no reason not to consume chicken . " the potentially lethal h5n1 strain has killed at least 90 people - almost half those who caught it - mostly in southeast asia and china where it first erupted but also in turkey and northern iraq . eu fears transmission of virus into human food chain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission said that the consumption of chicken is not a threat , at the moment the big fear in the eu - which is the world 's third biggest exporter of poultry after the united states and brazil - is that the virus passes from migratory swans to chickens , or other birds in the human food chain . the avian virus , first reported on europe 's southeastern flanks in early january , re-erupted with a vengeance last week , starting in italy and greece but now with almost daily cases in a string of european countries . in germany , authorities wednesday set up the now-standard 10-kilometer -lrb- six-mile -rrb- surveillance zone around the site where the dead wild swans were found on the island of rügen in the baltic sea . hours later hungary confirmed that it had detected the h5-type virus in the bodies of three dead swans in the south of the country . bloc admits it is powerless to stop the disease arriving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nothing can be done to prevent migratory birds landing in europe as the eu scrambles , some underline that there is basically little it can do to prevent the disease arriving .
" we have absolutely no control over the introduction of the virus by migratory birds that are about to start returning from africa to siberia , scandinavia and greenland , " said french food safety agency panelist jean hars .
" it is unavoidable , " he told reporters . until recently , the eu has said it is satisfied that the measures taken are sufficient . but brussels is closely monitoring the situation and if poultry should become infected , it may call for the culling of all birds and eggs on small holdings or farms .
in addition the european commission has proposed speeding up the process of clamping down on new outbreaks , by making arrangements automatic rather than on a case-by-case basis . experts assess " minimum risk " to poultry flocks meanwhile , health experts said wednesday that migrant birds carrying the virus appear to pose only a limited risk to western europe 's poultry flocks . in contrast to asia and africa , where chickens , ducks and geese raised for the pot are generally grown in open fields and farmyards , most of the european union 's poultry spends its life in large , enclosed sheds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized farms stand a good chance of remianing virus-free " migrating birds do not come into contact with fowl in these industrialized farms , so this is reassuring , " said jeanne brugere-picoux , a professor at the alfort veterinary school near paris and a pathologist in bird diseases .
" but precautions still have to be taken .
migrating birds are a risk , although the risk is more specifically for farmyard fowl which live out in the open and for domestic ducks , " she said . julian hughes , head of species conservation at the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- in britain , said the biggest potential source of transmission was in ponds , lakes or wetlands .
" the virus can be transmitted through a variety of ways , " he told reporters . " we know that the virus stays active within feces and in water for several days after it 's been shed from the bird .
but another route which is just as likely is direct contact , through nasal and bodily fluids , through the bill or the nose . ” " ducks and geese congregate in large numbers , thousands of them together .
they all feed together and when they roost at night , they tend to roost together in the middle of the water , so they are in pretty close contact . " spread attributed in part to movement of diseased poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range diseased poultry pose just as much threat as migratory birds hughes said it was quite possible that migrating birds could pick up the virus from infected poultry , rather than the other way round .
and he called for a sense of proportion , noting that outbreaks of bird flu were chiefly caused by the movement of diseased poultry , not wildlife . " the danger is that if everyone talks and concentrates on migratory birds , then bio-security measures get neglected , " he said . trying to stamp out h5n1 in wild birds through culls " is going to be entirely ineffective , because there are millions of birds on the move , " he said .

" -lrb- wednesday 's -rrb- decision ... was taken in light of the rapid spread of avian influenza over the past months and the current high risk of the disease spreading further , " said the european commission in a statement . so far , the h5n1 virus - which in its highly pathogenic form can be fatal to humans - has been detected within europe in austria , bulgaria , croatia , germany , greece , italy , romania , slovenia and ukraine . health commissioner marko kyprianou , attending the two days of talks with health experts from eu member states , underlined that there is unlikely to be an early end to the cases of bird flu . " given that the spring migration will begin soon we will review again the situation to see if there 's need for additional methods ...
we should n't be surprised if we have more migratory wild birds with this virus , " he said . " there 's no need to panic , " he warned .
" we have to advise the european public to stay calm ... there 's no reason not to consume chicken . " the potentially lethal h5n1 strain has killed at least 90 people - almost half those who caught it - mostly in southeast asia and china where it first erupted but also in turkey and northern iraq . eu fears transmission of virus into human food chain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission said that the consumption of chicken is not a threat , at the moment the big fear in the eu - which is the world 's third biggest exporter of poultry after the united states and brazil - is that the virus passes from migratory swans to chickens , or other birds in the human food chain . the avian virus , first reported on europe 's southeastern flanks in early january , re-erupted with a vengeance last week , starting in italy and greece but now with almost daily cases in a string of european countries . in germany , authorities wednesday set up the now-standard 10-kilometer -lrb- six-mile -rrb- surveillance zone around the site where the dead wild swans were found on the island of rügen in the baltic sea . hours later hungary confirmed that it had detected the h5-type virus in the bodies of three dead swans in the south of the country . bloc admits it is powerless to stop the disease arriving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nothing can be done to prevent migratory birds landing in europe as the eu scrambles , some underline that there is basically little it can do to prevent the disease arriving .
" we have absolutely no control over the introduction of the virus by migratory birds that are about to start returning from africa to siberia , scandinavia and greenland , " said french food safety agency panelist jean hars .
" it is unavoidable , " he told reporters . until recently , the eu has said it is satisfied that the measures taken are sufficient . but brussels is closely monitoring the situation and if poultry should become infected , it may call for the culling of all birds and eggs on small holdings or farms .
in addition the european commission has proposed speeding up the process of clamping down on new outbreaks , by making arrangements automatic rather than on a case-by-case basis . experts assess " minimum risk " to poultry flocks meanwhile , health experts said wednesday that migrant birds carrying the virus appear to pose only a limited risk to western europe 's poultry flocks . in contrast to asia and africa , where chickens , ducks and geese raised for the pot are generally grown in open fields and farmyards , most of the european union 's poultry spends its life in large , enclosed sheds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized farms stand a good chance of remianing virus-free " migrating birds do not come into contact with fowl in these industrialized farms , so this is reassuring , " said jeanne brugere-picoux , a professor at the alfort veterinary school near paris and a pathologist in bird diseases .
" but precautions still have to be taken .
migrating birds are a risk , although the risk is more specifically for farmyard fowl which live out in the open and for domestic ducks , " she said . julian hughes , head of species conservation at the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- in britain , said the biggest potential source of transmission was in ponds , lakes or wetlands .
" the virus can be transmitted through a variety of ways , " he told reporters . " we know that the virus stays active within feces and in water for several days after it 's been shed from the bird .
but another route which is just as likely is direct contact , through nasal and bodily fluids , through the bill or the nose . ” " ducks and geese congregate in large numbers , thousands of them together .
they all feed together and when they roost at night , they tend to roost together in the middle of the water , so they are in pretty close contact . " spread attributed in part to movement of diseased poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range diseased poultry pose just as much threat as migratory birds hughes said it was quite possible that migrating birds could pick up the virus from infected poultry , rather than the other way round .
and he called for a sense of proportion , noting that outbreaks of bird flu were chiefly caused by the movement of diseased poultry , not wildlife . " the danger is that if everyone talks and concentrates on migratory birds , then bio-security measures get neglected , " he said . trying to stamp out h5n1 in wild birds through culls " is going to be entirely ineffective , because there are millions of birds on the move , " he said .
" but you can do something about bio-security in the poultry sector .

one german state has decided to heed the call . bavaria makes no bones about the importance of its cultural identity , in which local language plays a particularly important role .
it should , therefore , come as little surprise that the sprawling southern state should be the first to launch a targeted initiative to reignite regional passions for its spoken heritage now deemed to be threatened by extinction .
earlier this month , the bavarian culture ministry presented a grand plan to help prevent its dialects from falling prey to linguistic evolution and the long arm of globalization .
the idea is to provide schools , both primary and secondary , with teaching material which would facilitate the integration of local dialects into regular classes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linguistic snobbery should become a thing of the past harald niedermair , a spokesman for the culture ministry , said one of the main aims of the project is to stamp out the stigma which is still attached to being a dialect speaker .
" even today , there are people who view local dialects as an inferior means of communication .
we want to prevent a situation in which pupils are excluded simply because of the way they speak . "
dialect no deficit niedermair said the proposed model , which could incorporate local dialects into subjects as diverse as theater , geography , music and math , promotes the virtue in being able to speak a second language , even if one of them is restricted to a relatively small geographical area .
" we want to support children 's ability for bilingualism , to show that it is something positive rather than a deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how bavarian are they once they start to speak ?
dialectologist bernhard stör agreed it was important to encourage children to speak in dialect , but said the culture ministry 's proposals do n't get to the root of the problem .
" as long as the general public views local dialect as a negative thing , the ministerial guidelines for teachers are nothing short of ridiculous . "
he said that schools ca n't be expected to influence the situation unless 50 percent of teaching is conducted in dialect .
too much too soon stör said dialects have been fighting a losing battle since the 1960s , when it became fashionable for children to tone down their indigenous tongues to remove any obstructions along the path to learning the purer " high german " considered the key to a successful future .
" the general idea back then was that if children were having to learn both their dialect and german , they were being exposed to unnecessary confusion , " stör said .
but that belief has now been proven untrue .
" new research , however , shows that the sooner they start , the easier it is for children to absorb other languages in the future . "

from the postwar era to the present day , the population of the bavarian capital , munich , has grown from half a million to almost 2.5 million inhabitants , but far from all of them can speak a local dialect .
" only four percent of greater munich residents under the age of 25 have so much as a passive understanding of the old bavarian dialect , " stör said .
although further out of town the numbers are a little higher , unless something is done to reverse the trend , it is only a matter of time before the city mentality reaches the countryside , he said .
too uncool for words " cities are always the linguistic frontrunners , " stör said , adding that the feeling among youngsters in munich is that dialect is simply uncool .
" children have absorbed the mentality of their parents , and often equate dialects with being dumb .
they think that if they want to get anywhere in their professional lives , they can not be seen to be speaking anything other than high german .

could it force the transrapid consortium onto the holding track on the sought-after chinese market ? china is developing a model to compete with the german high-speed magnetic levitation train transrapid .
according to the german newspaper die welt , chinese researchers in shanghai already want to test their own version in july . the chinese model with the name zhui feng -lrb- hunt the wind -rrb- would reach speeds of 500 kilometers an hour -lrb- 310 mph -rrb- and therefore be as fast as the german transrapid . chief engineer zheng from the chengdu aircraft industry cooperation -lrb- cac -rrb- , which is developing the train , said cac was not simply copying transrapid . " the one we 're building is completely different from the german one , " said zheng , who is responsible for design and technology .
" basically , we do n't know that much about the german technology . " he said cac did n't use any german materials or plans . german transrapid has more advantages the only transrapid connection in the world links shanghai and its airport .
china is planning an extension of this connection to the city of hangzhou , 180 kilometers away . transrapid spokesman peter wiegelmann said the german train had a significant advantage compared to the chinese competition .
it has been in commercial use for three years and proven its dependability .
it has transported six million passengers already . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german transrapid consortium is hoping for an order from britain " that 's why we expect opportunities with the transrapid technology , " said wiegelmann .
the consortium , made up of thyssen , siemens und adtranz , was " optimistic " that it would win the contract for the new route in shanghai . " the most important thing now is munich though " wiegelmann said .
the transrapid consortium is pushing for speedy construction of the long-awaited airport connection in munich .
the project approval procedure is currently in process . the transrapid consortium also hopes for orders from the united states , britain and the middle east . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , beijing sign high-speed rail deal china said it had signed a cooperation agreement with germany 's transport ministry for joint development of high-speed rail technology .

" -lrb- wednesday 's -rrb- decision ... was taken in light of the rapid spread of avian influenza over the past months and the current high risk of the disease spreading further , " said the european commission in a statement . so far , the h5n1 virus - which in its highly pathogenic form can be fatal to humans - has been detected within europe in austria , bulgaria , croatia , germany , greece , italy , romania , slovenia and ukraine . health commissioner marko kyprianou , attending the two days of talks with health experts from eu member states , underlined that there is unlikely to be an early end to the cases of bird flu . " given that the spring migration will begin soon we will review again the situation to see if there 's need for additional methods ...
we should n't be surprised if we have more migratory wild birds with this virus , " he said . " there 's no need to panic , " he warned .
" we have to advise the european public to stay calm ... there 's no reason not to consume chicken . " the potentially lethal h5n1 strain has killed at least 90 people - almost half those who caught it - mostly in southeast asia and china where it first erupted but also in turkey and northern iraq . eu fears transmission of virus into human food chain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission said that the consumption of chicken is not a threat , at the moment the big fear in the eu - which is the world 's third biggest exporter of poultry after the united states and brazil - is that the virus passes from migratory swans to chickens , or other birds in the human food chain . the avian virus , first reported on europe 's southeastern flanks in early january , re-erupted with a vengeance last week , starting in italy and greece but now with almost daily cases in a string of european countries . in germany , authorities wednesday set up the now-standard 10-kilometer -lrb- six-mile -rrb- surveillance zone around the site where the dead wild swans were found on the island of rügen in the baltic sea . hours later hungary confirmed that it had detected the h5-type virus in the bodies of three dead swans in the south of the country . bloc admits it is powerless to stop the disease arriving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nothing can be done to prevent migratory birds landing in europe as the eu scrambles , some underline that there is basically little it can do to prevent the disease arriving .
" we have absolutely no control over the introduction of the virus by migratory birds that are about to start returning from africa to siberia , scandinavia and greenland , " said french food safety agency panelist jean hars .
" it is unavoidable , " he told reporters . until recently , the eu has said it is satisfied that the measures taken are sufficient . but brussels is closely monitoring the situation and if poultry should become infected , it may call for the culling of all birds and eggs on small holdings or farms .
in addition the european commission has proposed speeding up the process of clamping down on new outbreaks , by making arrangements automatic rather than on a case-by-case basis . experts assess " minimum risk " to poultry flocks meanwhile , health experts said wednesday that migrant birds carrying the virus appear to pose only a limited risk to western europe 's poultry flocks . in contrast to asia and africa , where chickens , ducks and geese raised for the pot are generally grown in open fields and farmyards , most of the european union 's poultry spends its life in large , enclosed sheds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized farms stand a good chance of remianing virus-free " migrating birds do not come into contact with fowl in these industrialized farms , so this is reassuring , " said jeanne brugere-picoux , a professor at the alfort veterinary school near paris and a pathologist in bird diseases .
" but precautions still have to be taken .
migrating birds are a risk , although the risk is more specifically for farmyard fowl which live out in the open and for domestic ducks , " she said . julian hughes , head of species conservation at the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- in britain , said the biggest potential source of transmission was in ponds , lakes or wetlands .
" the virus can be transmitted through a variety of ways , " he told reporters . " we know that the virus stays active within feces and in water for several days after it 's been shed from the bird .
but another route which is just as likely is direct contact , through nasal and bodily fluids , through the bill or the nose . ” " ducks and geese congregate in large numbers , thousands of them together .
they all feed together and when they roost at night , they tend to roost together in the middle of the water , so they are in pretty close contact . " spread attributed in part to movement of diseased poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range diseased poultry pose just as much threat as migratory birds hughes said it was quite possible that migrating birds could pick up the virus from infected poultry , rather than the other way round .
and he called for a sense of proportion , noting that outbreaks of bird flu were chiefly caused by the movement of diseased poultry , not wildlife . " the danger is that if everyone talks and concentrates on migratory birds , then bio-security measures get neglected , " he said . trying to stamp out h5n1 in wild birds through culls " is going to be entirely ineffective , because there are millions of birds on the move , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.02.2006 preserving germany 's linguistic heritage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to being bavarian than dressing the part for years , unesco has been appealing to nations across the globe to promote their indigenous languages by filling classrooms with their multi-colored vernacular .
one german state has decided to heed the call . bavaria makes no bones about the importance of its cultural identity , in which local language plays a particularly important role .
it should , therefore , come as little surprise that the sprawling southern state should be the first to launch a targeted initiative to reignite regional passions for its spoken heritage now deemed to be threatened by extinction .
earlier this month , the bavarian culture ministry presented a grand plan to help prevent its dialects from falling prey to linguistic evolution and the long arm of globalization .
the idea is to provide schools , both primary and secondary , with teaching material which would facilitate the integration of local dialects into regular classes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linguistic snobbery should become a thing of the past harald niedermair , a spokesman for the culture ministry , said one of the main aims of the project is to stamp out the stigma which is still attached to being a dialect speaker .
" even today , there are people who view local dialects as an inferior means of communication .
we want to prevent a situation in which pupils are excluded simply because of the way they speak . "
dialect no deficit niedermair said the proposed model , which could incorporate local dialects into subjects as diverse as theater , geography , music and math , promotes the virtue in being able to speak a second language , even if one of them is restricted to a relatively small geographical area .
" we want to support children 's ability for bilingualism , to show that it is something positive rather than a deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how bavarian are they once they start to speak ?
dialectologist bernhard stör agreed it was important to encourage children to speak in dialect , but said the culture ministry 's proposals do n't get to the root of the problem .
" as long as the general public views local dialect as a negative thing , the ministerial guidelines for teachers are nothing short of ridiculous . "
he said that schools ca n't be expected to influence the situation unless 50 percent of teaching is conducted in dialect .
too much too soon stör said dialects have been fighting a losing battle since the 1960s , when it became fashionable for children to tone down their indigenous tongues to remove any obstructions along the path to learning the purer " high german " considered the key to a successful future .
" the general idea back then was that if children were having to learn both their dialect and german , they were being exposed to unnecessary confusion , " stör said .
but that belief has now been proven untrue .
" new research , however , shows that the sooner they start , the easier it is for children to absorb other languages in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich skyline that said , demographic evolution in bavaria has been such over the past decades that there are simply fewer dialect speakers to spread the word .
from the postwar era to the present day , the population of the bavarian capital , munich , has grown from half a million to almost 2.5 million inhabitants , but far from all of them can speak a local dialect .
" only four percent of greater munich residents under the age of 25 have so much as a passive understanding of the old bavarian dialect , " stör said .
although further out of town the numbers are a little higher , unless something is done to reverse the trend , it is only a matter of time before the city mentality reaches the countryside , he said .
too uncool for words " cities are always the linguistic frontrunners , " stör said , adding that the feeling among youngsters in munich is that dialect is simply uncool .
" children have absorbed the mentality of their parents , and often equate dialects with being dumb .
they think that if they want to get anywhere in their professional lives , they can not be seen to be speaking anything other than high german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr bavarian , edmund stoiber ?
and therein lies the catch .
for , as things stand , it is easier to get a job in numerous branches , including tourism and media , if you do n't bring a thick accent along to the interview .
stör said the responsibility for changing that lies with those in the public eye .
he cited franz beckenbauer and edmund stoiber as personalities who could , simply by using their mother tongue , convince bavarians that they do n't have to give up on their linguistic heritage to stand a chance of leading a successful professional life inside or outside bavaria 's borders . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese etiquette lessons for germany china 's economic boom has triggered a burgeoning travel industry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.02.2006 preserving germany 's linguistic heritage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to being bavarian than dressing the part for years , unesco has been appealing to nations across the globe to promote their indigenous languages by filling classrooms with their multi-colored vernacular .
one german state has decided to heed the call . bavaria makes no bones about the importance of its cultural identity , in which local language plays a particularly important role .
it should , therefore , come as little surprise that the sprawling southern state should be the first to launch a targeted initiative to reignite regional passions for its spoken heritage now deemed to be threatened by extinction .
earlier this month , the bavarian culture ministry presented a grand plan to help prevent its dialects from falling prey to linguistic evolution and the long arm of globalization .
the idea is to provide schools , both primary and secondary , with teaching material which would facilitate the integration of local dialects into regular classes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linguistic snobbery should become a thing of the past harald niedermair , a spokesman for the culture ministry , said one of the main aims of the project is to stamp out the stigma which is still attached to being a dialect speaker .
" even today , there are people who view local dialects as an inferior means of communication .
we want to prevent a situation in which pupils are excluded simply because of the way they speak . "
dialect no deficit niedermair said the proposed model , which could incorporate local dialects into subjects as diverse as theater , geography , music and math , promotes the virtue in being able to speak a second language , even if one of them is restricted to a relatively small geographical area .
" we want to support children 's ability for bilingualism , to show that it is something positive rather than a deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how bavarian are they once they start to speak ?
dialectologist bernhard stör agreed it was important to encourage children to speak in dialect , but said the culture ministry 's proposals do n't get to the root of the problem .
" as long as the general public views local dialect as a negative thing , the ministerial guidelines for teachers are nothing short of ridiculous . "
he said that schools ca n't be expected to influence the situation unless 50 percent of teaching is conducted in dialect .
too much too soon stör said dialects have been fighting a losing battle since the 1960s , when it became fashionable for children to tone down their indigenous tongues to remove any obstructions along the path to learning the purer " high german " considered the key to a successful future .
" the general idea back then was that if children were having to learn both their dialect and german , they were being exposed to unnecessary confusion , " stör said .
but that belief has now been proven untrue .
" new research , however , shows that the sooner they start , the easier it is for children to absorb other languages in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich skyline that said , demographic evolution in bavaria has been such over the past decades that there are simply fewer dialect speakers to spread the word .
from the postwar era to the present day , the population of the bavarian capital , munich , has grown from half a million to almost 2.5 million inhabitants , but far from all of them can speak a local dialect .
" only four percent of greater munich residents under the age of 25 have so much as a passive understanding of the old bavarian dialect , " stör said .
although further out of town the numbers are a little higher , unless something is done to reverse the trend , it is only a matter of time before the city mentality reaches the countryside , he said .
too uncool for words " cities are always the linguistic frontrunners , " stör said , adding that the feeling among youngsters in munich is that dialect is simply uncool .
" children have absorbed the mentality of their parents , and often equate dialects with being dumb .
they think that if they want to get anywhere in their professional lives , they can not be seen to be speaking anything other than high german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr bavarian , edmund stoiber ?
and therein lies the catch .
for , as things stand , it is easier to get a job in numerous branches , including tourism and media , if you do n't bring a thick accent along to the interview .
stör said the responsibility for changing that lies with those in the public eye .
he cited franz beckenbauer and edmund stoiber as personalities who could , simply by using their mother tongue , convince bavarians that they do n't have to give up on their linguistic heritage to stand a chance of leading a successful professional life inside or outside bavaria 's borders . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese etiquette lessons for germany china 's economic boom has triggered a burgeoning travel industry .

could it force the transrapid consortium onto the holding track on the sought-after chinese market ? china is developing a model to compete with the german high-speed magnetic levitation train transrapid .
according to the german newspaper die welt , chinese researchers in shanghai already want to test their own version in july . the chinese model with the name zhui feng -lrb- hunt the wind -rrb- would reach speeds of 500 kilometers an hour -lrb- 310 mph -rrb- and therefore be as fast as the german transrapid . chief engineer zheng from the chengdu aircraft industry cooperation -lrb- cac -rrb- , which is developing the train , said cac was not simply copying transrapid . " the one we 're building is completely different from the german one , " said zheng , who is responsible for design and technology .
" basically , we do n't know that much about the german technology . " he said cac did n't use any german materials or plans . german transrapid has more advantages the only transrapid connection in the world links shanghai and its airport .
china is planning an extension of this connection to the city of hangzhou , 180 kilometers away . transrapid spokesman peter wiegelmann said the german train had a significant advantage compared to the chinese competition .
it has been in commercial use for three years and proven its dependability .
it has transported six million passengers already . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german transrapid consortium is hoping for an order from britain " that 's why we expect opportunities with the transrapid technology , " said wiegelmann .
the consortium , made up of thyssen , siemens und adtranz , was " optimistic " that it would win the contract for the new route in shanghai . " the most important thing now is munich though " wiegelmann said .
the transrapid consortium is pushing for speedy construction of the long-awaited airport connection in munich .
the project approval procedure is currently in process . the transrapid consortium also hopes for orders from the united states , britain and the middle east . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , beijing sign high-speed rail deal china said it had signed a cooperation agreement with germany 's transport ministry for joint development of high-speed rail technology .

" it is a sub-type of h5n1 , which first appeared among poultry in china last year , " seehofer said in a speech carried on german television .
" even with the most rigorous action we can not assume that we will overcome this matter in a few weeks . " " given the worldwide spread of this virus , we are expecting more cases in germany , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer urged citizens to remain calm in the face of the outbreak seehofer 's agriculture ministry issued a ban on keeping poultry out of doors on wednesday , bringing the action forward to feb .
17 after the ministry had changed the date to feb .
20 from march 1 only hours before . the rural northern state of mecklenburg-vorpommern , where the infected swans were found , would be the first area to feel the immediate effect of the ban . the state was left reeling after a further 40 dead swans were found near the area where the first cases were found . seehofer urged the german public to remain calm and reiterated the opinion of health experts by saying that there was no evidence the disease could yet be spread from human to human , although a mutation in the virus could make this possible if someone suffering from human flu contracts the disease . migrating birds mixing with poultry a big risk the minister pointed to a heightened risk of the virus spreading across europe as migrating birds start returning to the continent .
" the return of migrating birds poses a big risk , " he said , adding that the top priority must be given to preventing bird flu spreading to farm animals , especially poultry bred for consumption . " we are dealing with a dangerous animal disease which also has potential danger to humans , " he said .
" the risk of the disease being spread by migrating birds must be regarded as considerably higher than previously .
it is essential that we prevent the disease being transmitted from wild birds to domestic poultry . " outbreaks of bird flu have now been recorded along the main migration routes . seehofer confirmed that a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- protection area had been set up around the island off northern germany where the dead swans were found .
a larger 10-kilometre surveillance zone is also in place around rügen , which lies 50 kilometers from northwestern poland . casual approach to dead swans criticized by politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dead swans remained untouched as state authorities dithered the mecklenburg-vorpommern authorities have been heavily criticized by a number of prominent german politicians for their casual reaction to the discovery of the dead birds . scenes of the dead swans lying over an expanse of beach showed little or no activity from state officials .
there was a distinct lack of anyone attempting to clear away the corpses or examine them in order to find the causes of their deaths . in response to the criticism , mecklenburg-vorpommern state environment and farm minister till backhaus admitted there had been some problems but blamed germany 's federal system for tying the hands of the state . under the federal system , local district councils had responsibility to collect and test dead birds and state authorities had no power to act . backhaus did add that he had been in contact with local councils and expected more rapid action . death toll yet to include eu victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : measures are being taken in europe to prevent the virus affecting the human population bird flu has already killed at least 90 people - almost half those who caught it - mostly in southeast asia and china where it first erupted but also in the asian part of turkey and northern iraq . in europe , the presence of the h5n1 virus has been confirmed in bulgaria , romania , greece , austria , italy , germany and the european part of russia . hungary , croatia , slovenia and ukraine are among countries investigating possible outbreaks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global infections and human cost here is a country-by-country breakdown of confirmed cases of avian flu in humans , as reported by the united nations world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- .

one german state has decided to heed the call . bavaria makes no bones about the importance of its cultural identity , in which local language plays a particularly important role .
it should , therefore , come as little surprise that the sprawling southern state should be the first to launch a targeted initiative to reignite regional passions for its spoken heritage now deemed to be threatened by extinction .
earlier this month , the bavarian culture ministry presented a grand plan to help prevent its dialects from falling prey to linguistic evolution and the long arm of globalization .
the idea is to provide schools , both primary and secondary , with teaching material which would facilitate the integration of local dialects into regular classes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linguistic snobbery should become a thing of the past harald niedermair , a spokesman for the culture ministry , said one of the main aims of the project is to stamp out the stigma which is still attached to being a dialect speaker .
" even today , there are people who view local dialects as an inferior means of communication .
we want to prevent a situation in which pupils are excluded simply because of the way they speak . "
dialect no deficit niedermair said the proposed model , which could incorporate local dialects into subjects as diverse as theater , geography , music and math , promotes the virtue in being able to speak a second language , even if one of them is restricted to a relatively small geographical area .
" we want to support children 's ability for bilingualism , to show that it is something positive rather than a deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how bavarian are they once they start to speak ?
dialectologist bernhard stör agreed it was important to encourage children to speak in dialect , but said the culture ministry 's proposals do n't get to the root of the problem .
" as long as the general public views local dialect as a negative thing , the ministerial guidelines for teachers are nothing short of ridiculous . "
he said that schools ca n't be expected to influence the situation unless 50 percent of teaching is conducted in dialect .
too much too soon stör said dialects have been fighting a losing battle since the 1960s , when it became fashionable for children to tone down their indigenous tongues to remove any obstructions along the path to learning the purer " high german " considered the key to a successful future .
" the general idea back then was that if children were having to learn both their dialect and german , they were being exposed to unnecessary confusion , " stör said .
but that belief has now been proven untrue .
" new research , however , shows that the sooner they start , the easier it is for children to absorb other languages in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich skyline that said , demographic evolution in bavaria has been such over the past decades that there are simply fewer dialect speakers to spread the word .
from the postwar era to the present day , the population of the bavarian capital , munich , has grown from half a million to almost 2.5 million inhabitants , but far from all of them can speak a local dialect .
" only four percent of greater munich residents under the age of 25 have so much as a passive understanding of the old bavarian dialect , " stör said .
although further out of town the numbers are a little higher , unless something is done to reverse the trend , it is only a matter of time before the city mentality reaches the countryside , he said .
too uncool for words " cities are always the linguistic frontrunners , " stör said , adding that the feeling among youngsters in munich is that dialect is simply uncool .
" children have absorbed the mentality of their parents , and often equate dialects with being dumb .
they think that if they want to get anywhere in their professional lives , they can not be seen to be speaking anything other than high german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr bavarian , edmund stoiber ?
and therein lies the catch .
for , as things stand , it is easier to get a job in numerous branches , including tourism and media , if you do n't bring a thick accent along to the interview .
stör said the responsibility for changing that lies with those in the public eye .
he cited franz beckenbauer and edmund stoiber as personalities who could , simply by using their mother tongue , convince bavarians that they do n't have to give up on their linguistic heritage to stand a chance of leading a successful professional life inside or outside bavaria 's borders . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese etiquette lessons for germany china 's economic boom has triggered a burgeoning travel industry .

one german state has decided to heed the call . bavaria makes no bones about the importance of its cultural identity , in which local language plays a particularly important role .
it should , therefore , come as little surprise that the sprawling southern state should be the first to launch a targeted initiative to reignite regional passions for its spoken heritage now deemed to be threatened by extinction .
earlier this month , the bavarian culture ministry presented a grand plan to help prevent its dialects from falling prey to linguistic evolution and the long arm of globalization .
the idea is to provide schools , both primary and secondary , with teaching material which would facilitate the integration of local dialects into regular classes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linguistic snobbery should become a thing of the past harald niedermair , a spokesman for the culture ministry , said one of the main aims of the project is to stamp out the stigma which is still attached to being a dialect speaker .
" even today , there are people who view local dialects as an inferior means of communication .
we want to prevent a situation in which pupils are excluded simply because of the way they speak . "
dialect no deficit niedermair said the proposed model , which could incorporate local dialects into subjects as diverse as theater , geography , music and math , promotes the virtue in being able to speak a second language , even if one of them is restricted to a relatively small geographical area .
" we want to support children 's ability for bilingualism , to show that it is something positive rather than a deficit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how bavarian are they once they start to speak ?
dialectologist bernhard stör agreed it was important to encourage children to speak in dialect , but said the culture ministry 's proposals do n't get to the root of the problem .
" as long as the general public views local dialect as a negative thing , the ministerial guidelines for teachers are nothing short of ridiculous . "
he said that schools ca n't be expected to influence the situation unless 50 percent of teaching is conducted in dialect .
too much too soon stör said dialects have been fighting a losing battle since the 1960s , when it became fashionable for children to tone down their indigenous tongues to remove any obstructions along the path to learning the purer " high german " considered the key to a successful future .
" the general idea back then was that if children were having to learn both their dialect and german , they were being exposed to unnecessary confusion , " stör said .
but that belief has now been proven untrue .
" new research , however , shows that the sooner they start , the easier it is for children to absorb other languages in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich skyline that said , demographic evolution in bavaria has been such over the past decades that there are simply fewer dialect speakers to spread the word .
from the postwar era to the present day , the population of the bavarian capital , munich , has grown from half a million to almost 2.5 million inhabitants , but far from all of them can speak a local dialect .
" only four percent of greater munich residents under the age of 25 have so much as a passive understanding of the old bavarian dialect , " stör said .
although further out of town the numbers are a little higher , unless something is done to reverse the trend , it is only a matter of time before the city mentality reaches the countryside , he said .
too uncool for words " cities are always the linguistic frontrunners , " stör said , adding that the feeling among youngsters in munich is that dialect is simply uncool .
" children have absorbed the mentality of their parents , and often equate dialects with being dumb .
they think that if they want to get anywhere in their professional lives , they can not be seen to be speaking anything other than high german .

for , as things stand , it is easier to get a job in numerous branches , including tourism and media , if you do n't bring a thick accent along to the interview .
stör said the responsibility for changing that lies with those in the public eye .
he cited franz beckenbauer and edmund stoiber as personalities who could , simply by using their mother tongue , convince bavarians that they do n't have to give up on their linguistic heritage to stand a chance of leading a successful professional life inside or outside bavaria 's borders . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese etiquette lessons for germany china 's economic boom has triggered a burgeoning travel industry .

" -lrb- wednesday 's -rrb- decision ... was taken in light of the rapid spread of avian influenza over the past months and the current high risk of the disease spreading further , " said the european commission in a statement . so far , the h5n1 virus - which in its highly pathogenic form can be fatal to humans - has been detected within europe in austria , bulgaria , croatia , germany , greece , italy , romania , slovenia and ukraine . health commissioner marko kyprianou , attending the two days of talks with health experts from eu member states , underlined that there is unlikely to be an early end to the cases of bird flu . " given that the spring migration will begin soon we will review again the situation to see if there 's need for additional methods ...
we should n't be surprised if we have more migratory wild birds with this virus , " he said . " there 's no need to panic , " he warned .
" we have to advise the european public to stay calm ... there 's no reason not to consume chicken . " the potentially lethal h5n1 strain has killed at least 90 people - almost half those who caught it - mostly in southeast asia and china where it first erupted but also in turkey and northern iraq . eu fears transmission of virus into human food chain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission said that the consumption of chicken is not a threat , at the moment the big fear in the eu - which is the world 's third biggest exporter of poultry after the united states and brazil - is that the virus passes from migratory swans to chickens , or other birds in the human food chain . the avian virus , first reported on europe 's southeastern flanks in early january , re-erupted with a vengeance last week , starting in italy and greece but now with almost daily cases in a string of european countries . in germany , authorities wednesday set up the now-standard 10-kilometer -lrb- six-mile -rrb- surveillance zone around the site where the dead wild swans were found on the island of rügen in the baltic sea . hours later hungary confirmed that it had detected the h5-type virus in the bodies of three dead swans in the south of the country . bloc admits it is powerless to stop the disease arriving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nothing can be done to prevent migratory birds landing in europe as the eu scrambles , some underline that there is basically little it can do to prevent the disease arriving .
" we have absolutely no control over the introduction of the virus by migratory birds that are about to start returning from africa to siberia , scandinavia and greenland , " said french food safety agency panelist jean hars .
" it is unavoidable , " he told reporters . until recently , the eu has said it is satisfied that the measures taken are sufficient . but brussels is closely monitoring the situation and if poultry should become infected , it may call for the culling of all birds and eggs on small holdings or farms .
in addition the european commission has proposed speeding up the process of clamping down on new outbreaks , by making arrangements automatic rather than on a case-by-case basis . experts assess " minimum risk " to poultry flocks meanwhile , health experts said wednesday that migrant birds carrying the virus appear to pose only a limited risk to western europe 's poultry flocks . in contrast to asia and africa , where chickens , ducks and geese raised for the pot are generally grown in open fields and farmyards , most of the european union 's poultry spends its life in large , enclosed sheds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized farms stand a good chance of remianing virus-free " migrating birds do not come into contact with fowl in these industrialized farms , so this is reassuring , " said jeanne brugere-picoux , a professor at the alfort veterinary school near paris and a pathologist in bird diseases .
" but precautions still have to be taken .
migrating birds are a risk , although the risk is more specifically for farmyard fowl which live out in the open and for domestic ducks , " she said . julian hughes , head of species conservation at the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- in britain , said the biggest potential source of transmission was in ponds , lakes or wetlands .
" the virus can be transmitted through a variety of ways , " he told reporters . " we know that the virus stays active within feces and in water for several days after it 's been shed from the bird .
but another route which is just as likely is direct contact , through nasal and bodily fluids , through the bill or the nose . ” " ducks and geese congregate in large numbers , thousands of them together .
they all feed together and when they roost at night , they tend to roost together in the middle of the water , so they are in pretty close contact . " spread attributed in part to movement of diseased poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range diseased poultry pose just as much threat as migratory birds hughes said it was quite possible that migrating birds could pick up the virus from infected poultry , rather than the other way round .
and he called for a sense of proportion , noting that outbreaks of bird flu were chiefly caused by the movement of diseased poultry , not wildlife . " the danger is that if everyone talks and concentrates on migratory birds , then bio-security measures get neglected , " he said . trying to stamp out h5n1 in wild birds through culls " is going to be entirely ineffective , because there are millions of birds on the move , " he said .

" -lrb- wednesday 's -rrb- decision ... was taken in light of the rapid spread of avian influenza over the past months and the current high risk of the disease spreading further , " said the european commission in a statement . so far , the h5n1 virus - which in its highly pathogenic form can be fatal to humans - has been detected within europe in austria , bulgaria , croatia , germany , greece , italy , romania , slovenia and ukraine . health commissioner marko kyprianou , attending the two days of talks with health experts from eu member states , underlined that there is unlikely to be an early end to the cases of bird flu . " given that the spring migration will begin soon we will review again the situation to see if there 's need for additional methods ...
we should n't be surprised if we have more migratory wild birds with this virus , " he said . " there 's no need to panic , " he warned .
" we have to advise the european public to stay calm ... there 's no reason not to consume chicken . " the potentially lethal h5n1 strain has killed at least 90 people - almost half those who caught it - mostly in southeast asia and china where it first erupted but also in turkey and northern iraq . eu fears transmission of virus into human food chain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission said that the consumption of chicken is not a threat , at the moment the big fear in the eu - which is the world 's third biggest exporter of poultry after the united states and brazil - is that the virus passes from migratory swans to chickens , or other birds in the human food chain . the avian virus , first reported on europe 's southeastern flanks in early january , re-erupted with a vengeance last week , starting in italy and greece but now with almost daily cases in a string of european countries . in germany , authorities wednesday set up the now-standard 10-kilometer -lrb- six-mile -rrb- surveillance zone around the site where the dead wild swans were found on the island of rügen in the baltic sea . hours later hungary confirmed that it had detected the h5-type virus in the bodies of three dead swans in the south of the country . bloc admits it is powerless to stop the disease arriving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nothing can be done to prevent migratory birds landing in europe as the eu scrambles , some underline that there is basically little it can do to prevent the disease arriving .
" we have absolutely no control over the introduction of the virus by migratory birds that are about to start returning from africa to siberia , scandinavia and greenland , " said french food safety agency panelist jean hars .
" it is unavoidable , " he told reporters . until recently , the eu has said it is satisfied that the measures taken are sufficient . but brussels is closely monitoring the situation and if poultry should become infected , it may call for the culling of all birds and eggs on small holdings or farms .
in addition the european commission has proposed speeding up the process of clamping down on new outbreaks , by making arrangements automatic rather than on a case-by-case basis . experts assess " minimum risk " to poultry flocks meanwhile , health experts said wednesday that migrant birds carrying the virus appear to pose only a limited risk to western europe 's poultry flocks . in contrast to asia and africa , where chickens , ducks and geese raised for the pot are generally grown in open fields and farmyards , most of the european union 's poultry spends its life in large , enclosed sheds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized farms stand a good chance of remianing virus-free " migrating birds do not come into contact with fowl in these industrialized farms , so this is reassuring , " said jeanne brugere-picoux , a professor at the alfort veterinary school near paris and a pathologist in bird diseases .
" but precautions still have to be taken .
migrating birds are a risk , although the risk is more specifically for farmyard fowl which live out in the open and for domestic ducks , " she said . julian hughes , head of species conservation at the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- in britain , said the biggest potential source of transmission was in ponds , lakes or wetlands .
" the virus can be transmitted through a variety of ways , " he told reporters . " we know that the virus stays active within feces and in water for several days after it 's been shed from the bird .
but another route which is just as likely is direct contact , through nasal and bodily fluids , through the bill or the nose . ” " ducks and geese congregate in large numbers , thousands of them together .
they all feed together and when they roost at night , they tend to roost together in the middle of the water , so they are in pretty close contact . " spread attributed in part to movement of diseased poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free-range diseased poultry pose just as much threat as migratory birds hughes said it was quite possible that migrating birds could pick up the virus from infected poultry , rather than the other way round .
and he called for a sense of proportion , noting that outbreaks of bird flu were chiefly caused by the movement of diseased poultry , not wildlife . " the danger is that if everyone talks and concentrates on migratory birds , then bio-security measures get neglected , " he said . trying to stamp out h5n1 in wild birds through culls " is going to be entirely ineffective , because there are millions of birds on the move , " he said .
" but you can do something about bio-security in the poultry sector .

the plan enjoys the support of the eu 's two largest parties , but some smaller groups are unhappy with the deal . the proposed directive , which the european commission originally put on the table in 2004 , aims to create a european service market free of most administrative and political obstacles currently holding back service providers from setting up shop in other member states .
supporters also hope it will generate much-needed jobs in the 25-nation bloc . " we can now move on to focus on the delivery of real economic benefits for consumers and companies , " said eurodeputy malcom harbour , who worked on the text on behalf of the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , the biggest political group in the parliament . the services sector is responsible for half the economic activity in the eu and 60 percent of its jobs .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said reforms are essential for spurring employment and growth in europe 's long-flagging economy . the directive , which still needs to be approved by the european commission and member states , would cover any service not explicitly excluded or covered by other eu-wide legislation .
catering , advertising , architects , the construction industry , accountants , hairdressing and the computer industry would all be covered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when they finish , these students could offer their services across europe the epp and the socialists , the parliament 's two largest parties , agreed health care and social services such as social housing and childcare would be excluded as well as services like education that are provided directly by the state . in order to reach a compromise before thursday 's vote , the parties watered down the proposal to allow member states to bar service providers for a number of reasons , provided the intervention is non-discriminatory . companies to follow host nation 's laws " what we 've got now is a directive which very clearly will promote opening markets , reduce red tape and facilitate cooperation , " german social democrat evelyne gebhardt told journalists .
" at the same time , i think it takes account of the rights of workers and consumers . " the deal , which passed by a 394-215 margin , will allow companies to provide their services across the eu , but require them to adhere to the labor , health , safety and environmental standards of the host country .
previous versions of the bill , which allowed companies to follow the standards of their home country , met with stiff resistance . the bill 's opponents , including germany , france and austria , fear an influx of cheap labor - epitomized by " polish plumbers " willing to work longer for less pay - would undercut local competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child care is one of the services the compromise would not open changes needed to push competition free market supporters , such as britain and the eu 's new east european member states , have said the directive is necessary to increase competition across the union . the agreed upon proposal , however , is too weak for some proponents .
epp vice-president and hungarian parliamentarian józsef szájer wrote in wednesday 's financial times that he thought a majority for a broader proposal could still be found and called on lawmakers to vote against the compromise . " if the number and extent of excuses for states to control service providers from other member states grows beyond the present situation , the original rationale of the draft directive is lost , " he wrote .
" if the text ends up according to last week 's compromise , it is better to vote against it , than support a directive that creates new obstacles and freezes europe 's services market for 30 more years . " the eu parliament was eager to produce a broad majority so that member states , who are themselves deeply divided on the issue , will not be tempted to veer from its text when it is the governments ' turn to look at the package . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to put service sector reform to the test plans to throw open europe 's vast services sector to tougher competition faces a crunch week as the european parliament prepares to vote on hotly contested new legislation .

" the surprise inspections of the airline were part of a eu commission investigation into suspected cooperation since year 2000 involving " routes within europe as well as to countries outside the european union , " sas said . serious charges airlines were suspected of reaching agreements regarding surcharges to offset external cost increases , it said . these were high fuel prices , costs for additional security measures in the wake of the sept .

dr. stefanie ritz-timme of the institute for forensic medicine in düsseldorf helped create the software and said it is the first of its kind . scientists and police hope to refine the software enough to be able to scan the massive amounts of image data that investigators routinely confiscate .
the software would automatically filter out images of children from older people , thereby relieving police of having to do the job manually .
the german criminal police office is collaborating with the team of forensic scientists and anthropologists - from germany , italy and lithuania - in the further development of the program .
the european union is also sponsoring the project with one million euros . the program is fast to spot a child bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric scanner identifies facial features the program currently requires just two minutes to classify an image of a face by age .
when the software scans an image databank , it can weed out illegal child pornography from permitted adult pornography found on the internet . for the specialized software to work , facial patterns must first be " logged " into the program .
the research team thus photographed the faces of 600 german , italian and lithuanian children and entered their facial characteristics into the program .
the researchers intend to photograph another 1,650 children and young people to enhance the software 's detection capabilities . different types of software help police trace victims while the computer program 's ability to pinpoint facial characteristics specific to children is new , computer software to hunt down child porn traffickers is not .
in september 2005 , the international criminal police organization interpol announced it would launch a major campaign to identify child sex victims and prosecute abusers with the help of special software . the software is supposed to minutely analyze pornographic material on the internet and spot key background clues .
according to reuters news agency , hamish mcculloch - an interpol official - said police around the world would have access to the technology and image database . " currently , investigations tend to focus on trying to seize computers , forensically examine the hard drive and obtain the evidence to prosecute for possession or distribution -lrb- of child pornography -rrb- , " mcculloch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet pornography is easily accessible but the efforts are often in vain as many countries have n't pushed for identifying and prosecuting child sex abusers .
therefore , the focus must be on identifying the victims , mcculloch said . " once you 've identified the victim , you 've identified the abuser .
the vast majority is identified through the victims , " he said .
interpol has built up a databank of hundreds of thousands of images of child porn victims and as a result has managed to rescue at least several hundred children . analyzing crime scenes leads to finding victims the specialized software , however , not only helps to identify victims , but also crime scenes .
in one famous case , interpol analyzed the photo of a young girl found on a computer in the united states and linked it to four pictures from belgium .
the software was able to determine that the four different children shown separately had been photographed in the same room because it had recognized the wallpaper pattern in the background .
investigators eventually traced the victims and found the abuser . according to the international children 's watchdog agency ecpat , based in bangkok , most child pornography is exchanged for free online .
however , it has also sparked an underground business worth billions of dollars that distributes millions of images of child sex abuse . despite the new detection software , police are hard-pressed to keep up with other technological developments .
digital cameras , web sites and e-mail make it easy for computer users to circulate any images they want . ecpat says half of the images of child abuse sold online come from the united states , and another quarter comes from russia .
the agency is calling for tougher laws that would require internet providers to monitor for sexual photos of children . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vast police probe pursues child porn police across europe swooped down on dozens of locations and arrested more than 20 suspects in a vast operation against an online child pornography network , the largest of its kind coordinated by europol .

in september 2005 , the international criminal police organization interpol announced it would launch a major campaign to identify child sex victims and prosecute abusers with the help of special software . the software is supposed to minutely analyze pornographic material on the internet and spot key background clues .
according to reuters news agency , hamish mcculloch - an interpol official - said police around the world would have access to the technology and image database .

the vast majority is identified through the victims , " he said .
interpol has built up a databank of hundreds of thousands of images of child porn victims and as a result has managed to rescue at least several hundred children . analyzing crime scenes leads to finding victims the specialized software , however , not only helps to identify victims , but also crime scenes .
in one famous case , interpol analyzed the photo of a young girl found on a computer in the united states and linked it to four pictures from belgium .
the software was able to determine that the four different children shown separately had been photographed in the same room because it had recognized the wallpaper pattern in the background .
investigators eventually traced the victims and found the abuser . according to the international children 's watchdog agency ecpat , based in bangkok , most child pornography is exchanged for free online .
however , it has also sparked an underground business worth billions of dollars that distributes millions of images of child sex abuse . despite the new detection software , police are hard-pressed to keep up with other technological developments .
digital cameras , web sites and e-mail make it easy for computer users to circulate any images they want . ecpat says half of the images of child abuse sold online come from the united states , and another quarter comes from russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note " love never goes out of fashion " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.02.2006 european films the must-have item at berlinale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " dark , gloomy , german ... we 'll take it ! "
european indie films are top of the shopping lists the movie stars , the gliterring premieres ... it 's the public face of the berlinale film festival .
but behind the scenes , the hard bargaining happens .
this year , the must-have item for distributors is edgy european cinema . for ten days in february , paparazzi and film fans alike take over marlene dietrich platz in downtown berlin .
the reason ?
berlinale - germany ’ s largest international film festival .
with 400 movies , the first of europe 's three major film festivals is bigger than ever , showing everything from hollywood blockbusters to art house debuts from lesser-known artists . but what has grown most in recent years is the berlinale 's european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- .
since competitor mifed stopped operating in milan , italy , last autumn and the american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moved from april to november , the european film market has become one of the most important events on the industry calendar . it 's the only market worldwide which takes place within the framework of a film-festival .
and among the world ’ s biggest international film festivals , the berlinale is unique .
it 's not just for invited guests and professionals , but is also open to the public . in the berlinale 's 30 cinemas , world premieres test a film ’ s potential success with critics and an international audience alike .
on tuesday , iranian director rafi pitts screened his new film " zemestan – it 's winter " which is competing for the berlinale 's golden bear prize this year . " for any film - whether iranian or not - a podium like berlin obviously is beautiful , " pitts said .
" because it helps art exist .
if you work in art house cinema , how else are you going to get people to find out about it ?
how else are you going to give that podium for smaller distributors to be helped and they release it .
so it 's a question to tell the world that the film exists . " the place to pick up quality european indies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european indies are drawing in the crowds at berlinale this year although hollywood blockbusters are also featured in berlin , their distribution and public relations deals were made long ago as part of their financing .
in berlin , the berlinale 's six sections mainly focus on art house cinema . and it 's at the european film market that the independent scene 's new releases are promoted and international distribution rights are negotiated . " this year we have a selection of 625 films coming from i think 48 countries , " said efm-director beki probst .
" we have a lot of american independents ; we are still going on with the straight-from-sundance program .
we have , of course , a lot of european films , also of course german films .
and we do have a lot of films from asia . " the efm is a real chance for independent films to find a wider audience .
edgy german competition-entry " elementary particles " became a market hit last week .
distributor celluloid dreams sold the adaptation of michel houellebecq 's book to distributors in 23 countries – all within 24 hours of the film 's berlinale debut . german films , actors and directors in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german film " elementary particles " has made a big splash " i think that there 's really something spectacular happening with the german cinema at the moment , " enthused beki probst .
such resurgence is good news for the german box office which is sorely in need of a boost .

"
european indie films are top of the shopping lists the movie stars , the gliterring premieres ... it 's the public face of the berlinale film festival .
but behind the scenes , the hard bargaining happens .
this year , the must-have item for distributors is edgy european cinema . for ten days in february , paparazzi and film fans alike take over marlene dietrich platz in downtown berlin .
the reason ?
berlinale - germany ’ s largest international film festival .
with 400 movies , the first of europe 's three major film festivals is bigger than ever , showing everything from hollywood blockbusters to art house debuts from lesser-known artists . but what has grown most in recent years is the berlinale 's european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- .
since competitor mifed stopped operating in milan , italy , last autumn and the american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moved from april to november , the european film market has become one of the most important events on the industry calendar . it 's the only market worldwide which takes place within the framework of a film-festival .
and among the world ’ s biggest international film festivals , the berlinale is unique .
it 's not just for invited guests and professionals , but is also open to the public . in the berlinale 's 30 cinemas , world premieres test a film ’ s potential success with critics and an international audience alike .
on tuesday , iranian director rafi pitts screened his new film " zemestan – it 's winter " which is competing for the berlinale 's golden bear prize this year . " for any film - whether iranian or not - a podium like berlin obviously is beautiful , " pitts said .
" because it helps art exist .
if you work in art house cinema , how else are you going to get people to find out about it ?
how else are you going to give that podium for smaller distributors to be helped and they release it .
so it 's a question to tell the world that the film exists . " the place to pick up quality european indies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european indies are drawing in the crowds at berlinale this year although hollywood blockbusters are also featured in berlin , their distribution and public relations deals were made long ago as part of their financing .

there was a distinct lack of anyone attempting to clear away the corpses or examine them in order to find the causes of their deaths . in response to the criticism , mecklenburg-vorpommern state environment and farm minister till backhaus admitted there had been some problems but blamed germany 's federal system for tying the hands of the state . under the federal system , local district councils had responsibility to collect and test dead birds and state authorities had no power to act . backhaus did add that he had been in contact with local councils and expected more rapid action . death toll yet to include eu victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : measures are being taken in europe to prevent the virus affecting the human population bird flu has already killed at least 90 people - almost half those who caught it - mostly in southeast asia and china where it first erupted but also in the asian part of turkey and northern iraq . in europe , the presence of the h5n1 virus has been confirmed in bulgaria , romania , greece , austria , italy , germany and the european part of russia . hungary , croatia , slovenia and ukraine are among countries investigating possible outbreaks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global infections and human cost here is a country-by-country breakdown of confirmed cases of avian flu in humans , as reported by the united nations world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- .

dr. stefanie ritz-timme of the institute for forensic medicine in düsseldorf helped create the software and said it is the first of its kind . scientists and police hope to refine the software enough to be able to scan the massive amounts of image data that investigators routinely confiscate .
the software would automatically filter out images of children from older people , thereby relieving police of having to do the job manually .
the german criminal police office is collaborating with the team of forensic scientists and anthropologists - from germany , italy and lithuania - in the further development of the program .
the european union is also sponsoring the project with one million euros . the program is fast to spot a child bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric scanner identifies facial features the program currently requires just two minutes to classify an image of a face by age .
when the software scans an image databank , it can weed out illegal child pornography from permitted adult pornography found on the internet . for the specialized software to work , facial patterns must first be " logged " into the program .
the research team thus photographed the faces of 600 german , italian and lithuanian children and entered their facial characteristics into the program .
the researchers intend to photograph another 1,650 children and young people to enhance the software 's detection capabilities . different types of software help police trace victims while the computer program 's ability to pinpoint facial characteristics specific to children is new , computer software to hunt down child porn traffickers is not .
in september 2005 , the international criminal police organization interpol announced it would launch a major campaign to identify child sex victims and prosecute abusers with the help of special software . the software is supposed to minutely analyze pornographic material on the internet and spot key background clues .
according to reuters news agency , hamish mcculloch - an interpol official - said police around the world would have access to the technology and image database . " currently , investigations tend to focus on trying to seize computers , forensically examine the hard drive and obtain the evidence to prosecute for possession or distribution -lrb- of child pornography -rrb- , " mcculloch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet pornography is easily accessible but the efforts are often in vain as many countries have n't pushed for identifying and prosecuting child sex abusers .
therefore , the focus must be on identifying the victims , mcculloch said . " once you 've identified the victim , you 've identified the abuser .
the vast majority is identified through the victims , " he said .
interpol has built up a databank of hundreds of thousands of images of child porn victims and as a result has managed to rescue at least several hundred children . analyzing crime scenes leads to finding victims the specialized software , however , not only helps to identify victims , but also crime scenes .
in one famous case , interpol analyzed the photo of a young girl found on a computer in the united states and linked it to four pictures from belgium .
the software was able to determine that the four different children shown separately had been photographed in the same room because it had recognized the wallpaper pattern in the background .
investigators eventually traced the victims and found the abuser . according to the international children 's watchdog agency ecpat , based in bangkok , most child pornography is exchanged for free online .
however , it has also sparked an underground business worth billions of dollars that distributes millions of images of child sex abuse . despite the new detection software , police are hard-pressed to keep up with other technological developments .
digital cameras , web sites and e-mail make it easy for computer users to circulate any images they want . ecpat says half of the images of child abuse sold online come from the united states , and another quarter comes from russia .
the agency is calling for tougher laws that would require internet providers to monitor for sexual photos of children . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vast police probe pursues child porn police across europe swooped down on dozens of locations and arrested more than 20 suspects in a vast operation against an online child pornography network , the largest of its kind coordinated by europol .

european lawmakers approved a hotly contested plan to open the bloc 's vast service sector thursday .
the plan enjoys the support of the eu 's two largest parties , but some smaller groups are unhappy with the deal . the proposed directive , which the european commission originally put on the table in 2004 , aims to create a european service market free of most administrative and political obstacles currently holding back service providers from setting up shop in other member states .
supporters also hope it will generate much-needed jobs in the 25-nation bloc . " we can now move on to focus on the delivery of real economic benefits for consumers and companies , " said eurodeputy malcom harbour , who worked on the text on behalf of the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , the biggest political group in the parliament . the services sector is responsible for half the economic activity in the eu and 60 percent of its jobs .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said reforms are essential for spurring employment and growth in europe 's long-flagging economy . the directive , which still needs to be approved by the european commission and member states , would cover any service not explicitly excluded or covered by other eu-wide legislation .
catering , advertising , architects , the construction industry , accountants , hairdressing and the computer industry would all be covered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when they finish , these students could offer their services across europe the epp and the socialists , the parliament 's two largest parties , agreed health care and social services such as social housing and childcare would be excluded as well as services like education that are provided directly by the state . in order to reach a compromise before thursday 's vote , the parties watered down the proposal to allow member states to bar service providers for a number of reasons , provided the intervention is non-discriminatory . companies to follow host nation 's laws " what we 've got now is a directive which very clearly will promote opening markets , reduce red tape and facilitate cooperation , " german social democrat evelyne gebhardt told journalists .
" at the same time , i think it takes account of the rights of workers and consumers . " the deal , which passed by a 394-215 margin , will allow companies to provide their services across the eu , but require them to adhere to the labor , health , safety and environmental standards of the host country .
previous versions of the bill , which allowed companies to follow the standards of their home country , met with stiff resistance . the bill 's opponents , including germany , france and austria , fear an influx of cheap labor - epitomized by " polish plumbers " willing to work longer for less pay - would undercut local competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child care is one of the services the compromise would not open changes needed to push competition free market supporters , such as britain and the eu 's new east european member states , have said the directive is necessary to increase competition across the union . the agreed upon proposal , however , is too weak for some proponents .
epp vice-president and hungarian parliamentarian józsef szájer wrote in wednesday 's financial times that he thought a majority for a broader proposal could still be found and called on lawmakers to vote against the compromise . " if the number and extent of excuses for states to control service providers from other member states grows beyond the present situation , the original rationale of the draft directive is lost , " he wrote .
" if the text ends up according to last week 's compromise , it is better to vote against it , than support a directive that creates new obstacles and freezes europe 's services market for 30 more years . " the eu parliament was eager to produce a broad majority so that member states , who are themselves deeply divided on the issue , will not be tempted to veer from its text when it is the governments ' turn to look at the package . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to put service sector reform to the test plans to throw open europe 's vast services sector to tougher competition faces a crunch week as the european parliament prepares to vote on hotly contested new legislation .

but come summer , he is hoping belis , his prague-based company , will have more work than ever thanks to a european parliament decision to open the bloc 's service sector . " we can sell swimming pools with our technology to germany but can not install them - that is really slowing us down , " he said , adding that he sold about 60 pools to germans last year .
" we would happily go and install our products for two days or longer and then go back home . " a 394-215 decision by eu lawmakers on thursday will get horn a step closer to having his own employees setting up pools across europe by knocking down nearly all of the national barriers that keep companies from one member state from offering their services in another eu country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horn said his workers want to install pools then go home " a foundation of the eu is the free movement of good and workers , " horn said .
" now we are in the eu , and our goods can move freely , but there still is not any movement in the labor force . " some fears and resistance remain not everyone in europe is happy to see the service sector expand .
on tuesday more than 20,000 people demonstrated against the plan , arguing it would lead to declining standards , lower wages and job losses , especially in the " older " eu member states . " it is not time for opening up services , above all when you have no rules for social harmonization and public services , " said french socialist pervenche beres .
" we ca n't accept the exclusion of social policy and consumer protection from the directive 's scope . " the approved directive requires companies adhere to the host nation 's laws , not their home-country requirements , a provision that previously led to the rejection of similar proposals as a number of eu states feared a flood of cheap migrant workers would undercut local businesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands took to the streets of strasbourg to protest the proposed directive horn , however , said he is prepared to meet each country 's conditions but was being held back by lengthy licensing procedures designed to protect local workers every time he wants to send his employees abroad . only britain , ireland and sweden opened their borders to foreign workers when the eu expanded to 25 members in may 2004 and are profiting from influx of workers while other nations continue to require work permits or have quotas in place to ward off mass migration , according to a eu report . no flood of migrant workers " membership in the eu does not trigger migration , " industry commissioner günter verheugen , the architect of the eu 's enlargement , told the press .
" on the contrary , -lrb- it -rrb- is a strong incentive to stay home and to try to improve living conditions there because there is new hope . " now horn said he is hoping the european commission and member states , which both need to approve the recently passed bill before it becomes binding , will quickly put their support behind the proposal so he can help non-czech 's cool off this summer .

european lawmakers approved a hotly contested plan to open the bloc 's vast service sector thursday .
the plan enjoys the support of the eu 's two largest parties , but some smaller groups are unhappy with the deal . the proposed directive , which the european commission originally put on the table in 2004 , aims to create a european service market free of most administrative and political obstacles currently holding back service providers from setting up shop in other member states .
supporters also hope it will generate much-needed jobs in the 25-nation bloc . " we can now move on to focus on the delivery of real economic benefits for consumers and companies , " said eurodeputy malcom harbour , who worked on the text on behalf of the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , the biggest political group in the parliament . the services sector is responsible for half the economic activity in the eu and 60 percent of its jobs .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said reforms are essential for spurring employment and growth in europe 's long-flagging economy . the directive , which still needs to be approved by the european commission and member states , would cover any service not explicitly excluded or covered by other eu-wide legislation .

european lawmakers approved a hotly contested plan to open the bloc 's vast service sector thursday .
the plan enjoys the support of the eu 's two largest parties , but some smaller groups are unhappy with the deal . the proposed directive , which the european commission originally put on the table in 2004 , aims to create a european service market free of most administrative and political obstacles currently holding back service providers from setting up shop in other member states .
supporters also hope it will generate much-needed jobs in the 25-nation bloc . " we can now move on to focus on the delivery of real economic benefits for consumers and companies , " said eurodeputy malcom harbour , who worked on the text on behalf of the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , the biggest political group in the parliament . the services sector is responsible for half the economic activity in the eu and 60 percent of its jobs .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said reforms are essential for spurring employment and growth in europe 's long-flagging economy . the directive , which still needs to be approved by the european commission and member states , would cover any service not explicitly excluded or covered by other eu-wide legislation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note " love never goes out of fashion " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.02.2006 european films the must-have item at berlinale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " dark , gloomy , german ... we 'll take it ! "
european indie films are top of the shopping lists the movie stars , the gliterring premieres ... it 's the public face of the berlinale film festival .
but behind the scenes , the hard bargaining happens .
this year , the must-have item for distributors is edgy european cinema . for ten days in february , paparazzi and film fans alike take over marlene dietrich platz in downtown berlin .
the reason ?
berlinale - germany ’ s largest international film festival .
with 400 movies , the first of europe 's three major film festivals is bigger than ever , showing everything from hollywood blockbusters to art house debuts from lesser-known artists . but what has grown most in recent years is the berlinale 's european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- .
since competitor mifed stopped operating in milan , italy , last autumn and the american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moved from april to november , the european film market has become one of the most important events on the industry calendar . it 's the only market worldwide which takes place within the framework of a film-festival .
and among the world ’ s biggest international film festivals , the berlinale is unique .
it 's not just for invited guests and professionals , but is also open to the public . in the berlinale 's 30 cinemas , world premieres test a film ’ s potential success with critics and an international audience alike .
on tuesday , iranian director rafi pitts screened his new film " zemestan – it 's winter " which is competing for the berlinale 's golden bear prize this year . " for any film - whether iranian or not - a podium like berlin obviously is beautiful , " pitts said .
" because it helps art exist .
if you work in art house cinema , how else are you going to get people to find out about it ?
how else are you going to give that podium for smaller distributors to be helped and they release it .
so it 's a question to tell the world that the film exists . " the place to pick up quality european indies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european indies are drawing in the crowds at berlinale this year although hollywood blockbusters are also featured in berlin , their distribution and public relations deals were made long ago as part of their financing .
in berlin , the berlinale 's six sections mainly focus on art house cinema . and it 's at the european film market that the independent scene 's new releases are promoted and international distribution rights are negotiated . " this year we have a selection of 625 films coming from i think 48 countries , " said efm-director beki probst .
" we have a lot of american independents ; we are still going on with the straight-from-sundance program .
we have , of course , a lot of european films , also of course german films .
and we do have a lot of films from asia . " the efm is a real chance for independent films to find a wider audience .
edgy german competition-entry " elementary particles " became a market hit last week .
distributor celluloid dreams sold the adaptation of michel houellebecq 's book to distributors in 23 countries – all within 24 hours of the film 's berlinale debut . german films , actors and directors in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german film " elementary particles " has made a big splash " i think that there 's really something spectacular happening with the german cinema at the moment , " enthused beki probst .
such resurgence is good news for the german box office which is sorely in need of a boost .
like most of europe , cinema admissions were down last year in germany to 21.5 million , a slump from the 36.7 million of the previous year . but this year , traders are paying particular attention to new german actors , young directors and their films .
the diversity in style and content has never been broader .
this year 's berlinale is showcasing 55 local films in all , including four in the festival 's main competition . europe looks to the future with funding initiative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of european films will hopefully boost ticket sales in 2006 with more than 700 films now being produced each year in europe , a new think tank was launched at the european film market this week by the danish film institute .
" if we want to promote european films and make sure the 1.5 billion euros spent on supporting european films are used correctly , we should use funding more effectively , " the institute said . european film makers are hoping that the discussions find a way to better support their products and to allow artists to bring their visions to life and to the market place at places like the berlinale . peter zimmermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale applauds german film about rapist a film about a rapist 's attempts to escape his past at the berlinale upholds the film festival 's reputation for dealing with wrenching subjects .
the director says he is emphasizing loneliness , not rape , in the picture .

dr. stefanie ritz-timme of the institute for forensic medicine in düsseldorf helped create the software and said it is the first of its kind . scientists and police hope to refine the software enough to be able to scan the massive amounts of image data that investigators routinely confiscate .
the software would automatically filter out images of children from older people , thereby relieving police of having to do the job manually .
the german criminal police office is collaborating with the team of forensic scientists and anthropologists - from germany , italy and lithuania - in the further development of the program .
the european union is also sponsoring the project with one million euros . the program is fast to spot a child bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric scanner identifies facial features the program currently requires just two minutes to classify an image of a face by age .
when the software scans an image databank , it can weed out illegal child pornography from permitted adult pornography found on the internet . for the specialized software to work , facial patterns must first be " logged " into the program .
the research team thus photographed the faces of 600 german , italian and lithuanian children and entered their facial characteristics into the program .
the researchers intend to photograph another 1,650 children and young people to enhance the software 's detection capabilities . different types of software help police trace victims while the computer program 's ability to pinpoint facial characteristics specific to children is new , computer software to hunt down child porn traffickers is not .
in september 2005 , the international criminal police organization interpol announced it would launch a major campaign to identify child sex victims and prosecute abusers with the help of special software . the software is supposed to minutely analyze pornographic material on the internet and spot key background clues .
according to reuters news agency , hamish mcculloch - an interpol official - said police around the world would have access to the technology and image database . " currently , investigations tend to focus on trying to seize computers , forensically examine the hard drive and obtain the evidence to prosecute for possession or distribution -lrb- of child pornography -rrb- , " mcculloch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet pornography is easily accessible but the efforts are often in vain as many countries have n't pushed for identifying and prosecuting child sex abusers .
therefore , the focus must be on identifying the victims , mcculloch said . " once you 've identified the victim , you 've identified the abuser .
the vast majority is identified through the victims , " he said .
interpol has built up a databank of hundreds of thousands of images of child porn victims and as a result has managed to rescue at least several hundred children . analyzing crime scenes leads to finding victims the specialized software , however , not only helps to identify victims , but also crime scenes .
in one famous case , interpol analyzed the photo of a young girl found on a computer in the united states and linked it to four pictures from belgium .
the software was able to determine that the four different children shown separately had been photographed in the same room because it had recognized the wallpaper pattern in the background .
investigators eventually traced the victims and found the abuser . according to the international children 's watchdog agency ecpat , based in bangkok , most child pornography is exchanged for free online .
however , it has also sparked an underground business worth billions of dollars that distributes millions of images of child sex abuse . despite the new detection software , police are hard-pressed to keep up with other technological developments .
digital cameras , web sites and e-mail make it easy for computer users to circulate any images they want . ecpat says half of the images of child abuse sold online come from the united states , and another quarter comes from russia .
the agency is calling for tougher laws that would require internet providers to monitor for sexual photos of children . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vast police probe pursues child porn police across europe swooped down on dozens of locations and arrested more than 20 suspects in a vast operation against an online child pornography network , the largest of its kind coordinated by europol .

dr. stefanie ritz-timme of the institute for forensic medicine in düsseldorf helped create the software and said it is the first of its kind . scientists and police hope to refine the software enough to be able to scan the massive amounts of image data that investigators routinely confiscate .
the software would automatically filter out images of children from older people , thereby relieving police of having to do the job manually .
the german criminal police office is collaborating with the team of forensic scientists and anthropologists - from germany , italy and lithuania - in the further development of the program .
the european union is also sponsoring the project with one million euros . the program is fast to spot a child bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric scanner identifies facial features the program currently requires just two minutes to classify an image of a face by age .
when the software scans an image databank , it can weed out illegal child pornography from permitted adult pornography found on the internet . for the specialized software to work , facial patterns must first be " logged " into the program .
the research team thus photographed the faces of 600 german , italian and lithuanian children and entered their facial characteristics into the program .
the researchers intend to photograph another 1,650 children and young people to enhance the software 's detection capabilities . different types of software help police trace victims while the computer program 's ability to pinpoint facial characteristics specific to children is new , computer software to hunt down child porn traffickers is not .
in september 2005 , the international criminal police organization interpol announced it would launch a major campaign to identify child sex victims and prosecute abusers with the help of special software . the software is supposed to minutely analyze pornographic material on the internet and spot key background clues .
according to reuters news agency , hamish mcculloch - an interpol official - said police around the world would have access to the technology and image database . " currently , investigations tend to focus on trying to seize computers , forensically examine the hard drive and obtain the evidence to prosecute for possession or distribution -lrb- of child pornography -rrb- , " mcculloch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet pornography is easily accessible but the efforts are often in vain as many countries have n't pushed for identifying and prosecuting child sex abusers .
therefore , the focus must be on identifying the victims , mcculloch said . " once you 've identified the victim , you 've identified the abuser .
the vast majority is identified through the victims , " he said .
interpol has built up a databank of hundreds of thousands of images of child porn victims and as a result has managed to rescue at least several hundred children . analyzing crime scenes leads to finding victims the specialized software , however , not only helps to identify victims , but also crime scenes .
in one famous case , interpol analyzed the photo of a young girl found on a computer in the united states and linked it to four pictures from belgium .
the software was able to determine that the four different children shown separately had been photographed in the same room because it had recognized the wallpaper pattern in the background .
investigators eventually traced the victims and found the abuser . according to the international children 's watchdog agency ecpat , based in bangkok , most child pornography is exchanged for free online .
however , it has also sparked an underground business worth billions of dollars that distributes millions of images of child sex abuse . despite the new detection software , police are hard-pressed to keep up with other technological developments .
digital cameras , web sites and e-mail make it easy for computer users to circulate any images they want . ecpat says half of the images of child abuse sold online come from the united states , and another quarter comes from russia .
the agency is calling for tougher laws that would require internet providers to monitor for sexual photos of children . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vast police probe pursues child porn police across europe swooped down on dozens of locations and arrested more than 20 suspects in a vast operation against an online child pornography network , the largest of its kind coordinated by europol .

" it is a sub-type of h5n1 , which first appeared among poultry in china last year , " seehofer said in a speech carried on german television .
" even with the most rigorous action we can not assume that we will overcome this matter in a few weeks . " " given the worldwide spread of this virus , we are expecting more cases in germany , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer urged citizens to remain calm in the face of the outbreak seehofer 's agriculture ministry issued a ban on keeping poultry out of doors on wednesday , bringing the action forward to feb .
17 after the ministry had changed the date to feb .
20 from march 1 only hours before . the rural northern state of mecklenburg-vorpommern , where the infected swans were found , would be the first area to feel the immediate effect of the ban . the state was left reeling after a further 40 dead swans were found near the area where the first cases were found . seehofer urged the german public to remain calm and reiterated the opinion of health experts by saying that there was no evidence the disease could yet be spread from human to human , although a mutation in the virus could make this possible if someone suffering from human flu contracts the disease . migrating birds mixing with poultry a big risk the minister pointed to a heightened risk of the virus spreading across europe as migrating birds start returning to the continent .
" the return of migrating birds poses a big risk , " he said , adding that the top priority must be given to preventing bird flu spreading to farm animals , especially poultry bred for consumption . " we are dealing with a dangerous animal disease which also has potential danger to humans , " he said .
" the risk of the disease being spread by migrating birds must be regarded as considerably higher than previously .
it is essential that we prevent the disease being transmitted from wild birds to domestic poultry . " outbreaks of bird flu have now been recorded along the main migration routes . seehofer confirmed that a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- protection area had been set up around the island off northern germany where the dead swans were found .
a larger 10-kilometre surveillance zone is also in place around rügen , which lies 50 kilometers from northwestern poland . casual approach to dead swans criticized by politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dead swans remained untouched as state authorities dithered the mecklenburg-vorpommern authorities have been heavily criticized by a number of prominent german politicians for their casual reaction to the discovery of the dead birds . scenes of the dead swans lying over an expanse of beach showed little or no activity from state officials .
there was a distinct lack of anyone attempting to clear away the corpses or examine them in order to find the causes of their deaths . in response to the criticism , mecklenburg-vorpommern state environment and farm minister till backhaus admitted there had been some problems but blamed germany 's federal system for tying the hands of the state . under the federal system , local district councils had responsibility to collect and test dead birds and state authorities had no power to act . backhaus did add that he had been in contact with local councils and expected more rapid action . death toll yet to include eu victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : measures are being taken in europe to prevent the virus affecting the human population bird flu has already killed at least 90 people - almost half those who caught it - mostly in southeast asia and china where it first erupted but also in the asian part of turkey and northern iraq . in europe , the presence of the h5n1 virus has been confirmed in bulgaria , romania , greece , austria , italy , germany and the european part of russia . hungary , croatia , slovenia and ukraine are among countries investigating possible outbreaks . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global infections and human cost here is a country-by-country breakdown of confirmed cases of avian flu in humans , as reported by the united nations world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- .

" it is a sub-type of h5n1 , which first appeared among poultry in china last year , " seehofer said in a speech carried on german television .

"
european indie films are top of the shopping lists the movie stars , the gliterring premieres ... it 's the public face of the berlinale film festival .
but behind the scenes , the hard bargaining happens .
this year , the must-have item for distributors is edgy european cinema . for ten days in february , paparazzi and film fans alike take over marlene dietrich platz in downtown berlin .
the reason ?
berlinale - germany ’ s largest international film festival .
with 400 movies , the first of europe 's three major film festivals is bigger than ever , showing everything from hollywood blockbusters to art house debuts from lesser-known artists . but what has grown most in recent years is the berlinale 's european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- .
since competitor mifed stopped operating in milan , italy , last autumn and the american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moved from april to november , the european film market has become one of the most important events on the industry calendar . it 's the only market worldwide which takes place within the framework of a film-festival .
and among the world ’ s biggest international film festivals , the berlinale is unique .
it 's not just for invited guests and professionals , but is also open to the public . in the berlinale 's 30 cinemas , world premieres test a film ’ s potential success with critics and an international audience alike .
on tuesday , iranian director rafi pitts screened his new film " zemestan – it 's winter " which is competing for the berlinale 's golden bear prize this year . " for any film - whether iranian or not - a podium like berlin obviously is beautiful , " pitts said .
" because it helps art exist .
if you work in art house cinema , how else are you going to get people to find out about it ?
how else are you going to give that podium for smaller distributors to be helped and they release it .
so it 's a question to tell the world that the film exists . " the place to pick up quality european indies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european indies are drawing in the crowds at berlinale this year although hollywood blockbusters are also featured in berlin , their distribution and public relations deals were made long ago as part of their financing .
in berlin , the berlinale 's six sections mainly focus on art house cinema . and it 's at the european film market that the independent scene 's new releases are promoted and international distribution rights are negotiated . " this year we have a selection of 625 films coming from i think 48 countries , " said efm-director beki probst .
" we have a lot of american independents ; we are still going on with the straight-from-sundance program .
we have , of course , a lot of european films , also of course german films .
and we do have a lot of films from asia . " the efm is a real chance for independent films to find a wider audience .
edgy german competition-entry " elementary particles " became a market hit last week .
distributor celluloid dreams sold the adaptation of michel houellebecq 's book to distributors in 23 countries – all within 24 hours of the film 's berlinale debut . german films , actors and directors in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german film " elementary particles " has made a big splash " i think that there 's really something spectacular happening with the german cinema at the moment , " enthused beki probst .
such resurgence is good news for the german box office which is sorely in need of a boost .
like most of europe , cinema admissions were down last year in germany to 21.5 million , a slump from the 36.7 million of the previous year . but this year , traders are paying particular attention to new german actors , young directors and their films .
the diversity in style and content has never been broader .
this year 's berlinale is showcasing 55 local films in all , including four in the festival 's main competition . europe looks to the future with funding initiative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of european films will hopefully boost ticket sales in 2006 with more than 700 films now being produced each year in europe , a new think tank was launched at the european film market this week by the danish film institute .
" if we want to promote european films and make sure the 1.5 billion euros spent on supporting european films are used correctly , we should use funding more effectively , " the institute said . european film makers are hoping that the discussions find a way to better support their products and to allow artists to bring their visions to life and to the market place at places like the berlinale . peter zimmermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : berlinale applauds german film about rapist a film about a rapist 's attempts to escape his past at the berlinale upholds the film festival 's reputation for dealing with wrenching subjects .

the monthly reuters tankan survey of leading companies had a reading of 34 from manufacturers in february , up from 33 in january and december 's 32 figure .
confidence was highest in the car and wider transport equipment sector .
however , non-manufacturing firms were not as upbeat , with their confidence reading dropping to 17 in february from 22 in january .
corporate insight sentiment was worst among the real estate , construction , and retailing sectors .

did you give a goat ?
they were the surprise hit of the christmas shopping season - but now it turns out that giving a goat may not be such a great idea after all .
sick of trawling round the high street for presents which end up in the charity shop , thousands of people decided to buy a goat instead , for a family in the developing world .
" no ifs or butts , " said oxfam " a goat is a great gift . "
what you told breakfast it smells of hypocrisy when world land trust criticises another organisation about ethical gifts .
the organisation offers consumers the opportunity to buy rainforest rob daly , london the problem is the human management of the situation .
as usual , goats are blamed as they are usually the last animals able to graze land which has been degraded by other animals such as cattle and sheep .
amanda benson read more viewers ' comments on our your say page but now it turns out that the animals may not be so good after all .
renowned for their ability to eat almost anything , goats can have a devastating effect on the environment , according to another charity , the world land trust .
it 's saying that the animals may well be a short term fixed for hard-pressed villages - but in the long run , they 'll make matters even worse .
this morning on breakfast we debated the rights and wrongs of giving a goat .
we talked to john burton , chief executive of the world land trust - and oxfam 's international director , caroline nursey .
each works closely with environmental projects in the developing world - but they have very different views on how to help .

the move is set to end an effective nationwide ban on the drug , ru486 .
current health minister tony abbott is a staunch roman catholic who has not allowed the use of the drug .
future requests from doctors to prescribe the drug will now be decided by a regulatory body , the therapeutic goods administration -lrb- tga -rrb- .
the tga already regulates the use of other drugs and medical devices .
the house of representatives approved the measure on thursday .
no vote was actually taken , because it was clear that the majority of mps supported the change .
australia 's senate had already voted to take control of the drug away from the government .
the bbc 's sydney correspondent , phil mercer , says mps put party politics aside and were allowed a rare conscience vote .
their decision followed a passionate , and at times , heated debate .
supporters of ru486 argued that it was a cheaper and less invasive method of abortion than surgery .
thursday 's vote was " a winner for australian women and their families , and also a winner for the house of representatives , " said senator lyn allison , one of the bill 's co-authors .
but critics of the drug , which is already in use in 35 countries to terminate a pregnancy of up to 49 days , say it is unsafe and an elected official should be in charge of it .
mr abbott said it was an " unutterable shame " that there were up to 100,000 abortions a year in australia and that some women saw this as " a badge of liberation " .
contrasting views the issue split prime minister john howard and his heir-apparent , peter costello .
mr howard voiced his opposition to the bill , saying it was the duty of parliament to take responsibility for making difficult decisions for the country .
but mr costello voted to remove the power of the health minister , after telling parliament how he had to decide whether to abort an unborn child as his wife lay ill and unconscious in hospital , 18 years ago .
" the choice i made was to continue both the treatment and the pregnancy .
by the grace of god , both survived , " he said .
" i have no doubt that the law should not have prevented such a choice - that the law should allow a choice , whether physical or mental health of the woman is at risk , " mr costello said .
