program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.12.2006 dinner for one : a german new year 's eve ritual großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miss sophie and butler , james have been regaling german audiences for years a classic tv sketch of a senile british woman and her drunk butler at her 90th birthday party thrills millions of germans every new year 's eve . millions of germans and other continental europeans will settle down in front of their tv sets on new year 's eve for what has become an annual ritual - the airing of an aged british comedy sketch starring a long-dead music-hall comedy called " dinner for one . " the 15-minute sketch , acted by freddie frinton and may warden , will also be televised by every other major regional public-tv channel in germany and by a scattering of commercial networks . the black-and-white british slapstick sketch , totally unknown in the english-speaking world , has become the highest-rated tv show in german history , and has spawned fan clubs and a cult following of viewers who stage parties to recreate the sketch at home . in a nation not exactly known for its ribaldry and thigh-slapping humor , the new year 's eve showing of " dinner for one " never fails to bring down the house .
there are viewers who have memorized every gesture , every line of the english-only sketch . same procedure … the mere mention of the tag-line , " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " will break the ice with the sternest of stern-faced germans .
mention that line , regardless of the situation , and be prepared for the german to reply with , " same procedure as every year , james , " and then collapse into hysterical laughter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks are an annual german tradition it is a phenomenon that has become ritualized into tradition .
" the dinner for one " sketch was originally performed in the 1920s in british music halls . in the early 1960s , a german television producer had caught the stage act in blackpool and invited frinton to fly back to hamburg with him to tape the sketch for a one-time broadcast in 1963 . studio employees and in-house secretaries served as the live audience for the sketch about a butler who gets riotously drunk while serving food and drinks to his employer , miss sophie , and her guests on her 90th birthday . the running joke is that she sits alone at the table because she has outlived all her male guests who were her former lovers .
butler james assumes the role of each ' guest ' in order to toast miss sophie with champagne , wine , port and so on throughout the meal .
before each toast , he asks plaintively : " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " to which she responds , " the same procedure as every year , james . " the " same procedure " line is repeated one final time after dinner as butler james escorts miss sophie upstairs to bed , with frinton leering knowingly at the audience and affirming , " i 'll do me very best ! " the highest ratings the sketch was used as a new year 's eve filler on ndr television in hamburg in the early 1970s and it quickly became a regular part of german new year 's eve celebrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : butler james has wowed german viewers since 1963 over the years somehow , it has become a cult classic in germany - to the extent that it is shown on dozens of regional channels at some point over new year and ndr shows it six or seven times during new year 's eve . " it usually has the highest rating of any program shown during the year , " says jürgen meier-beer , ndr 's head of entertainment .
" we have an average market share in our area of 8 percent .
' dinner for one ' gets us up to 20 to 30 percent every time .
we reckon that one in every two viewers in our area will watch it at some point on new year 's eve . " in recent years , it has also been shown in austria , switzerland , denmark and other countries . ironically , frinton died long before his sketch made him a household name across central europe . getting in on the joke many germans are shocked to learn that the rest of the world is ignorant of this pearl of british humor . english-speaking visitors to germany are invariably flummoxed by continual references to this obscure sketch .
in a bid to make casual conversation , a german might ask , " what do you think of ' dinner for one ' ? " " ' dinner for one ' what , " is often the reply . " you know - ' dinner for one ' - ' james , miss sophie , same procedure as every year ? " '
and then they break into an uncontrolled fit of giggles . a silly moment of merriment also , germans are amazed that few people in britain under the age of 50 know who frinton was .
in fact , frinton was a master at playing comic drunks and had a huge following on british television in the 1950s . he was a bit past his prime when he taped the german version of his popular sketch .
viewed for the first time , the sketch seems dated and stale , an impression not helped by the fact that it was shot in black and white , and recorded on videotape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate hosts a showy new year 's party but what germans love about " dinner for one " is the fact that it is a silly moment of merriment that has become enshrined in the nation 's psyche .
people remember seeing it when they were young and with people who are no longer present , and they remember new year 's eves gone by . the sketch , of course , improves from repeated viewing , not unlike the rocky horror picture show .
and on new year 's eve , of course , many viewers have been raising their glasses in toasts all evening already and are as smashed as frinton 's character in the sketch .
that makes it easy for millions to slur the lines right along with the inebriated butler . never shown in britain what many people in germany do n't realize is that the sketch has never been shown in either britain or the us , though it has had a few showings on australian cable tv . but then , there are those german-language figures who are unknown in germany .
when a german asks what you think of " dinner for one , " one can respond by asking what they think of " the sound of music . " then the shoe will be on the other foot .
one can even launch into a rendition of the song , " edelweiss . "

" the 15-minute sketch , acted by freddie frinton and may warden , will also be televised by every other major regional public-tv channel in germany and by a scattering of commercial networks . the black-and-white british slapstick sketch , totally unknown in the english-speaking world , has become the highest-rated tv show in german history , and has spawned fan clubs and a cult following of viewers who stage parties to recreate the sketch at home . in a nation not exactly known for its ribaldry and thigh-slapping humor , the new year 's eve showing of " dinner for one " never fails to bring down the house .
there are viewers who have memorized every gesture , every line of the english-only sketch . same procedure … the mere mention of the tag-line , " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " will break the ice with the sternest of stern-faced germans .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks are an annual german tradition it is a phenomenon that has become ritualized into tradition .
" the dinner for one " sketch was originally performed in the 1920s in british music halls . in the early 1960s , a german television producer had caught the stage act in blackpool and invited frinton to fly back to hamburg with him to tape the sketch for a one-time broadcast in 1963 . studio employees and in-house secretaries served as the live audience for the sketch about a butler who gets riotously drunk while serving food and drinks to his employer , miss sophie , and her guests on her 90th birthday . the running joke is that she sits alone at the table because she has outlived all her male guests who were her former lovers .

" it usually has the highest rating of any program shown during the year , " says jürgen meier-beer , ndr 's head of entertainment .
" we have an average market share in our area of 8 percent .

and then they break into an uncontrolled fit of giggles . a silly moment of merriment also , germans are amazed that few people in britain under the age of 50 know who frinton was .
in fact , frinton was a master at playing comic drunks and had a huge following on british television in the 1950s . he was a bit past his prime when he taped the german version of his popular sketch .

" the 15-minute sketch , acted by freddie frinton and may warden , will also be televised by every other major regional public-tv channel in germany and by a scattering of commercial networks . the black-and-white british slapstick sketch , totally unknown in the english-speaking world , has become the highest-rated tv show in german history , and has spawned fan clubs and a cult following of viewers who stage parties to recreate the sketch at home . in a nation not exactly known for its ribaldry and thigh-slapping humor , the new year 's eve showing of " dinner for one " never fails to bring down the house .
there are viewers who have memorized every gesture , every line of the english-only sketch . same procedure … the mere mention of the tag-line , " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " will break the ice with the sternest of stern-faced germans .
mention that line , regardless of the situation , and be prepared for the german to reply with , " same procedure as every year , james , " and then collapse into hysterical laughter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks are an annual german tradition it is a phenomenon that has become ritualized into tradition .
" the dinner for one " sketch was originally performed in the 1920s in british music halls . in the early 1960s , a german television producer had caught the stage act in blackpool and invited frinton to fly back to hamburg with him to tape the sketch for a one-time broadcast in 1963 . studio employees and in-house secretaries served as the live audience for the sketch about a butler who gets riotously drunk while serving food and drinks to his employer , miss sophie , and her guests on her 90th birthday . the running joke is that she sits alone at the table because she has outlived all her male guests who were her former lovers .
butler james assumes the role of each ' guest ' in order to toast miss sophie with champagne , wine , port and so on throughout the meal .
before each toast , he asks plaintively : " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " to which she responds , " the same procedure as every year , james . " the " same procedure " line is repeated one final time after dinner as butler james escorts miss sophie upstairs to bed , with frinton leering knowingly at the audience and affirming , " i 'll do me very best ! " the highest ratings the sketch was used as a new year 's eve filler on ndr television in hamburg in the early 1970s and it quickly became a regular part of german new year 's eve celebrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : butler james has wowed german viewers since 1963 over the years somehow , it has become a cult classic in germany - to the extent that it is shown on dozens of regional channels at some point over new year and ndr shows it six or seven times during new year 's eve . " it usually has the highest rating of any program shown during the year , " says jürgen meier-beer , ndr 's head of entertainment .
" we have an average market share in our area of 8 percent .
' dinner for one ' gets us up to 20 to 30 percent every time .
we reckon that one in every two viewers in our area will watch it at some point on new year 's eve . " in recent years , it has also been shown in austria , switzerland , denmark and other countries . ironically , frinton died long before his sketch made him a household name across central europe . getting in on the joke many germans are shocked to learn that the rest of the world is ignorant of this pearl of british humor . english-speaking visitors to germany are invariably flummoxed by continual references to this obscure sketch .
in a bid to make casual conversation , a german might ask , " what do you think of ' dinner for one ' ? " " ' dinner for one ' what , " is often the reply . " you know - ' dinner for one ' - ' james , miss sophie , same procedure as every year ? " '
and then they break into an uncontrolled fit of giggles . a silly moment of merriment also , germans are amazed that few people in britain under the age of 50 know who frinton was .
in fact , frinton was a master at playing comic drunks and had a huge following on british television in the 1950s . he was a bit past his prime when he taped the german version of his popular sketch .
viewed for the first time , the sketch seems dated and stale , an impression not helped by the fact that it was shot in black and white , and recorded on videotape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate hosts a showy new year 's party but what germans love about " dinner for one " is the fact that it is a silly moment of merriment that has become enshrined in the nation 's psyche .
people remember seeing it when they were young and with people who are no longer present , and they remember new year 's eves gone by . the sketch , of course , improves from repeated viewing , not unlike the rocky horror picture show .
and on new year 's eve , of course , many viewers have been raising their glasses in toasts all evening already and are as smashed as frinton 's character in the sketch .
that makes it easy for millions to slur the lines right along with the inebriated butler . never shown in britain what many people in germany do n't realize is that the sketch has never been shown in either britain or the us , though it has had a few showings on australian cable tv . but then , there are those german-language figures who are unknown in germany .
when a german asks what you think of " dinner for one , " one can respond by asking what they think of " the sound of music . " then the shoe will be on the other foot .
one can even launch into a rendition of the song , " edelweiss . "

" the 15-minute sketch , acted by freddie frinton and may warden , will also be televised by every other major regional public-tv channel in germany and by a scattering of commercial networks . the black-and-white british slapstick sketch , totally unknown in the english-speaking world , has become the highest-rated tv show in german history , and has spawned fan clubs and a cult following of viewers who stage parties to recreate the sketch at home . in a nation not exactly known for its ribaldry and thigh-slapping humor , the new year 's eve showing of " dinner for one " never fails to bring down the house .
there are viewers who have memorized every gesture , every line of the english-only sketch . same procedure … the mere mention of the tag-line , " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " will break the ice with the sternest of stern-faced germans .
mention that line , regardless of the situation , and be prepared for the german to reply with , " same procedure as every year , james , " and then collapse into hysterical laughter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks are an annual german tradition it is a phenomenon that has become ritualized into tradition .
" the dinner for one " sketch was originally performed in the 1920s in british music halls . in the early 1960s , a german television producer had caught the stage act in blackpool and invited frinton to fly back to hamburg with him to tape the sketch for a one-time broadcast in 1963 . studio employees and in-house secretaries served as the live audience for the sketch about a butler who gets riotously drunk while serving food and drinks to his employer , miss sophie , and her guests on her 90th birthday . the running joke is that she sits alone at the table because she has outlived all her male guests who were her former lovers .
butler james assumes the role of each ' guest ' in order to toast miss sophie with champagne , wine , port and so on throughout the meal .
before each toast , he asks plaintively : " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " to which she responds , " the same procedure as every year , james . " the " same procedure " line is repeated one final time after dinner as butler james escorts miss sophie upstairs to bed , with frinton leering knowingly at the audience and affirming , " i 'll do me very best ! " the highest ratings the sketch was used as a new year 's eve filler on ndr television in hamburg in the early 1970s and it quickly became a regular part of german new year 's eve celebrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : butler james has wowed german viewers since 1963 over the years somehow , it has become a cult classic in germany - to the extent that it is shown on dozens of regional channels at some point over new year and ndr shows it six or seven times during new year 's eve . " it usually has the highest rating of any program shown during the year , " says jürgen meier-beer , ndr 's head of entertainment .
" we have an average market share in our area of 8 percent .
' dinner for one ' gets us up to 20 to 30 percent every time .
we reckon that one in every two viewers in our area will watch it at some point on new year 's eve . " in recent years , it has also been shown in austria , switzerland , denmark and other countries . ironically , frinton died long before his sketch made him a household name across central europe . getting in on the joke many germans are shocked to learn that the rest of the world is ignorant of this pearl of british humor . english-speaking visitors to germany are invariably flummoxed by continual references to this obscure sketch .
in a bid to make casual conversation , a german might ask , " what do you think of ' dinner for one ' ? " " ' dinner for one ' what , " is often the reply . " you know - ' dinner for one ' - ' james , miss sophie , same procedure as every year ? " '
and then they break into an uncontrolled fit of giggles . a silly moment of merriment also , germans are amazed that few people in britain under the age of 50 know who frinton was .
in fact , frinton was a master at playing comic drunks and had a huge following on british television in the 1950s . he was a bit past his prime when he taped the german version of his popular sketch .
viewed for the first time , the sketch seems dated and stale , an impression not helped by the fact that it was shot in black and white , and recorded on videotape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate hosts a showy new year 's party but what germans love about " dinner for one " is the fact that it is a silly moment of merriment that has become enshrined in the nation 's psyche .
people remember seeing it when they were young and with people who are no longer present , and they remember new year 's eves gone by . the sketch , of course , improves from repeated viewing , not unlike the rocky horror picture show .
and on new year 's eve , of course , many viewers have been raising their glasses in toasts all evening already and are as smashed as frinton 's character in the sketch .
that makes it easy for millions to slur the lines right along with the inebriated butler . never shown in britain what many people in germany do n't realize is that the sketch has never been shown in either britain or the us , though it has had a few showings on australian cable tv . but then , there are those german-language figures who are unknown in germany .
when a german asks what you think of " dinner for one , " one can respond by asking what they think of " the sound of music . " then the shoe will be on the other foot .
one can even launch into a rendition of the song , " edelweiss . "

butler james assumes the role of each ' guest ' in order to toast miss sophie with champagne , wine , port and so on throughout the meal .
before each toast , he asks plaintively : " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " to which she responds , " the same procedure as every year , james . " the " same procedure " line is repeated one final time after dinner as butler james escorts miss sophie upstairs to bed , with frinton leering knowingly at the audience and affirming , " i 'll do me very best ! " the highest ratings the sketch was used as a new year 's eve filler on ndr television in hamburg in the early 1970s and it quickly became a regular part of german new year 's eve celebrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : butler james has wowed german viewers since 1963 over the years somehow , it has become a cult classic in germany - to the extent that it is shown on dozens of regional channels at some point over new year and ndr shows it six or seven times during new year 's eve . " it usually has the highest rating of any program shown during the year , " says jürgen meier-beer , ndr 's head of entertainment .
" we have an average market share in our area of 8 percent .
' dinner for one ' gets us up to 20 to 30 percent every time .
we reckon that one in every two viewers in our area will watch it at some point on new year 's eve . " in recent years , it has also been shown in austria , switzerland , denmark and other countries . ironically , frinton died long before his sketch made him a household name across central europe . getting in on the joke many germans are shocked to learn that the rest of the world is ignorant of this pearl of british humor . english-speaking visitors to germany are invariably flummoxed by continual references to this obscure sketch .
in a bid to make casual conversation , a german might ask , " what do you think of ' dinner for one ' ? " " ' dinner for one ' what , " is often the reply . " you know - ' dinner for one ' - ' james , miss sophie , same procedure as every year ? " '
and then they break into an uncontrolled fit of giggles . a silly moment of merriment also , germans are amazed that few people in britain under the age of 50 know who frinton was .
in fact , frinton was a master at playing comic drunks and had a huge following on british television in the 1950s . he was a bit past his prime when he taped the german version of his popular sketch .
viewed for the first time , the sketch seems dated and stale , an impression not helped by the fact that it was shot in black and white , and recorded on videotape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate hosts a showy new year 's party but what germans love about " dinner for one " is the fact that it is a silly moment of merriment that has become enshrined in the nation 's psyche .
people remember seeing it when they were young and with people who are no longer present , and they remember new year 's eves gone by . the sketch , of course , improves from repeated viewing , not unlike the rocky horror picture show .
and on new year 's eve , of course , many viewers have been raising their glasses in toasts all evening already and are as smashed as frinton 's character in the sketch .
that makes it easy for millions to slur the lines right along with the inebriated butler . never shown in britain what many people in germany do n't realize is that the sketch has never been shown in either britain or the us , though it has had a few showings on australian cable tv . but then , there are those german-language figures who are unknown in germany .
when a german asks what you think of " dinner for one , " one can respond by asking what they think of " the sound of music . " then the shoe will be on the other foot .
one can even launch into a rendition of the song , " edelweiss . "

" the 15-minute sketch , acted by freddie frinton and may warden , will also be televised by every other major regional public-tv channel in germany and by a scattering of commercial networks . the black-and-white british slapstick sketch , totally unknown in the english-speaking world , has become the highest-rated tv show in german history , and has spawned fan clubs and a cult following of viewers who stage parties to recreate the sketch at home . in a nation not exactly known for its ribaldry and thigh-slapping humor , the new year 's eve showing of " dinner for one " never fails to bring down the house .
there are viewers who have memorized every gesture , every line of the english-only sketch . same procedure … the mere mention of the tag-line , " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " will break the ice with the sternest of stern-faced germans .
mention that line , regardless of the situation , and be prepared for the german to reply with , " same procedure as every year , james , " and then collapse into hysterical laughter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks are an annual german tradition it is a phenomenon that has become ritualized into tradition .
" the dinner for one " sketch was originally performed in the 1920s in british music halls . in the early 1960s , a german television producer had caught the stage act in blackpool and invited frinton to fly back to hamburg with him to tape the sketch for a one-time broadcast in 1963 . studio employees and in-house secretaries served as the live audience for the sketch about a butler who gets riotously drunk while serving food and drinks to his employer , miss sophie , and her guests on her 90th birthday . the running joke is that she sits alone at the table because she has outlived all her male guests who were her former lovers .
butler james assumes the role of each ' guest ' in order to toast miss sophie with champagne , wine , port and so on throughout the meal .
before each toast , he asks plaintively : " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " to which she responds , " the same procedure as every year , james . " the " same procedure " line is repeated one final time after dinner as butler james escorts miss sophie upstairs to bed , with frinton leering knowingly at the audience and affirming , " i 'll do me very best ! " the highest ratings the sketch was used as a new year 's eve filler on ndr television in hamburg in the early 1970s and it quickly became a regular part of german new year 's eve celebrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : butler james has wowed german viewers since 1963 over the years somehow , it has become a cult classic in germany - to the extent that it is shown on dozens of regional channels at some point over new year and ndr shows it six or seven times during new year 's eve . " it usually has the highest rating of any program shown during the year , " says jürgen meier-beer , ndr 's head of entertainment .
" we have an average market share in our area of 8 percent .
' dinner for one ' gets us up to 20 to 30 percent every time .
we reckon that one in every two viewers in our area will watch it at some point on new year 's eve . " in recent years , it has also been shown in austria , switzerland , denmark and other countries . ironically , frinton died long before his sketch made him a household name across central europe . getting in on the joke many germans are shocked to learn that the rest of the world is ignorant of this pearl of british humor . english-speaking visitors to germany are invariably flummoxed by continual references to this obscure sketch .
in a bid to make casual conversation , a german might ask , " what do you think of ' dinner for one ' ? " " ' dinner for one ' what , " is often the reply . " you know - ' dinner for one ' - ' james , miss sophie , same procedure as every year ? " '
and then they break into an uncontrolled fit of giggles . a silly moment of merriment also , germans are amazed that few people in britain under the age of 50 know who frinton was .
in fact , frinton was a master at playing comic drunks and had a huge following on british television in the 1950s . he was a bit past his prime when he taped the german version of his popular sketch .
viewed for the first time , the sketch seems dated and stale , an impression not helped by the fact that it was shot in black and white , and recorded on videotape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate hosts a showy new year 's party but what germans love about " dinner for one " is the fact that it is a silly moment of merriment that has become enshrined in the nation 's psyche .
people remember seeing it when they were young and with people who are no longer present , and they remember new year 's eves gone by . the sketch , of course , improves from repeated viewing , not unlike the rocky horror picture show .
and on new year 's eve , of course , many viewers have been raising their glasses in toasts all evening already and are as smashed as frinton 's character in the sketch .
that makes it easy for millions to slur the lines right along with the inebriated butler . never shown in britain what many people in germany do n't realize is that the sketch has never been shown in either britain or the us , though it has had a few showings on australian cable tv . but then , there are those german-language figures who are unknown in germany .
when a german asks what you think of " dinner for one , " one can respond by asking what they think of " the sound of music . " then the shoe will be on the other foot .

" the 15-minute sketch , acted by freddie frinton and may warden , will also be televised by every other major regional public-tv channel in germany and by a scattering of commercial networks . the black-and-white british slapstick sketch , totally unknown in the english-speaking world , has become the highest-rated tv show in german history , and has spawned fan clubs and a cult following of viewers who stage parties to recreate the sketch at home . in a nation not exactly known for its ribaldry and thigh-slapping humor , the new year 's eve showing of " dinner for one " never fails to bring down the house .
there are viewers who have memorized every gesture , every line of the english-only sketch . same procedure … the mere mention of the tag-line , " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " will break the ice with the sternest of stern-faced germans .
mention that line , regardless of the situation , and be prepared for the german to reply with , " same procedure as every year , james , " and then collapse into hysterical laughter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks are an annual german tradition it is a phenomenon that has become ritualized into tradition .
" the dinner for one " sketch was originally performed in the 1920s in british music halls . in the early 1960s , a german television producer had caught the stage act in blackpool and invited frinton to fly back to hamburg with him to tape the sketch for a one-time broadcast in 1963 . studio employees and in-house secretaries served as the live audience for the sketch about a butler who gets riotously drunk while serving food and drinks to his employer , miss sophie , and her guests on her 90th birthday . the running joke is that she sits alone at the table because she has outlived all her male guests who were her former lovers .
butler james assumes the role of each ' guest ' in order to toast miss sophie with champagne , wine , port and so on throughout the meal .
before each toast , he asks plaintively : " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " to which she responds , " the same procedure as every year , james . " the " same procedure " line is repeated one final time after dinner as butler james escorts miss sophie upstairs to bed , with frinton leering knowingly at the audience and affirming , " i 'll do me very best ! " the highest ratings the sketch was used as a new year 's eve filler on ndr television in hamburg in the early 1970s and it quickly became a regular part of german new year 's eve celebrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : butler james has wowed german viewers since 1963 over the years somehow , it has become a cult classic in germany - to the extent that it is shown on dozens of regional channels at some point over new year and ndr shows it six or seven times during new year 's eve . " it usually has the highest rating of any program shown during the year , " says jürgen meier-beer , ndr 's head of entertainment .
" we have an average market share in our area of 8 percent .
' dinner for one ' gets us up to 20 to 30 percent every time .
we reckon that one in every two viewers in our area will watch it at some point on new year 's eve . " in recent years , it has also been shown in austria , switzerland , denmark and other countries . ironically , frinton died long before his sketch made him a household name across central europe . getting in on the joke many germans are shocked to learn that the rest of the world is ignorant of this pearl of british humor . english-speaking visitors to germany are invariably flummoxed by continual references to this obscure sketch .
in a bid to make casual conversation , a german might ask , " what do you think of ' dinner for one ' ? " " ' dinner for one ' what , " is often the reply . " you know - ' dinner for one ' - ' james , miss sophie , same procedure as every year ? " '
and then they break into an uncontrolled fit of giggles . a silly moment of merriment also , germans are amazed that few people in britain under the age of 50 know who frinton was .
in fact , frinton was a master at playing comic drunks and had a huge following on british television in the 1950s . he was a bit past his prime when he taped the german version of his popular sketch .
viewed for the first time , the sketch seems dated and stale , an impression not helped by the fact that it was shot in black and white , and recorded on videotape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate hosts a showy new year 's party but what germans love about " dinner for one " is the fact that it is a silly moment of merriment that has become enshrined in the nation 's psyche .
people remember seeing it when they were young and with people who are no longer present , and they remember new year 's eves gone by . the sketch , of course , improves from repeated viewing , not unlike the rocky horror picture show .
and on new year 's eve , of course , many viewers have been raising their glasses in toasts all evening already and are as smashed as frinton 's character in the sketch .
that makes it easy for millions to slur the lines right along with the inebriated butler . never shown in britain what many people in germany do n't realize is that the sketch has never been shown in either britain or the us , though it has had a few showings on australian cable tv . but then , there are those german-language figures who are unknown in germany .
when a german asks what you think of " dinner for one , " one can respond by asking what they think of " the sound of music . " then the shoe will be on the other foot .
one can even launch into a rendition of the song , " edelweiss . "

besides , eu headquarters in brussels will be keeping a close eye on whether the two nations abide by their pledges to crack down on corruption and organized crime . meanwhile , in a clearer success story , all is ready for eu member slovenia to become on january 1 the first former communist state to adopt the union 's common currency , the euro , officials said in ljubljana . big new year 's bash in romania , bulgaria thousands of revelers were expected to flock to a gigantic rock and pop concert on alexander battenberg square in the bulgarian capital , sofia .
the show will be interrupted for speeches by president georgi parvanov , prime minister sergei stanichev and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
but the partying is expected to continue long into the night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a romanian worker checks the eu stars as the country perpares for eu celebrations a pyramid of light will illuminate the sky above sofia , its five rays emanating from the city 's orthodox cathedral , its armenian church , a synagogue , a church and a mosque . in bucharest , european parliament president josep borrel and other dignitaries including foreign ministers from germany , bulgaria , denmark and hungary are to meet with romanian president traian basescu and prime minister calin tariceanu for a countdown until midnight , and adhesion to the eu . the latest euro barometer poll published in december shows that at the eve of accession 63 percent of all bulgarians and 69 percent of all romanians think their eastern european states will largely benefit from eu membership .
this is above the european norm where the average approval of membership hovers around 54 percent . together with greece , the two newcomers will be the only balkan nations in europe 's rich club , and will play a key role as representatives of a region ravaged by the wars in the former yugoslavia . eu 's poorest members political analyst ivan krastev of the sofia-based centre for liberal strategies told afp that " with the accession of bulgaria and romania the region will receive a clear message that enlargement is not dead . " eu leaders agreed december 15 in brussels to put the lid on further enlargement of the bloc .
the decision has major repercussions for eu hopefuls in the balkans such as croatia , which is at the front of the queue and expected to join by 2010 . bulgaria and romania will be europe 's poorest members with gross domestic product per capita barely reaching one third of the european average , eurostat statistics show . the two will contribute only one percent to the eu 's gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian women from the mohammedan ethnic minority , also called pomaks the gap between bulgaria and romania and the current eu members has raised fears of a sharp rise in prices after january 1 in the newcomers where average monthly salaries are about 200 euros -lrb- $ 260 -rrb- . perhaps due to people fearing instant inflation , bulgaria this month saw a 30 percent rise in purchases compared to the usual end of year holiday spending spree .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.12.2006 dinner for one : a german new year 's eve ritual großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miss sophie and butler , james have been regaling german audiences for years a classic tv sketch of a senile british woman and her drunk butler at her 90th birthday party thrills millions of germans every new year 's eve . millions of germans and other continental europeans will settle down in front of their tv sets on new year 's eve for what has become an annual ritual - the airing of an aged british comedy sketch starring a long-dead music-hall comedy called " dinner for one . " the 15-minute sketch , acted by freddie frinton and may warden , will also be televised by every other major regional public-tv channel in germany and by a scattering of commercial networks . the black-and-white british slapstick sketch , totally unknown in the english-speaking world , has become the highest-rated tv show in german history , and has spawned fan clubs and a cult following of viewers who stage parties to recreate the sketch at home . in a nation not exactly known for its ribaldry and thigh-slapping humor , the new year 's eve showing of " dinner for one " never fails to bring down the house .
there are viewers who have memorized every gesture , every line of the english-only sketch . same procedure … the mere mention of the tag-line , " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " will break the ice with the sternest of stern-faced germans .
mention that line , regardless of the situation , and be prepared for the german to reply with , " same procedure as every year , james , " and then collapse into hysterical laughter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks are an annual german tradition it is a phenomenon that has become ritualized into tradition .
" the dinner for one " sketch was originally performed in the 1920s in british music halls . in the early 1960s , a german television producer had caught the stage act in blackpool and invited frinton to fly back to hamburg with him to tape the sketch for a one-time broadcast in 1963 . studio employees and in-house secretaries served as the live audience for the sketch about a butler who gets riotously drunk while serving food and drinks to his employer , miss sophie , and her guests on her 90th birthday . the running joke is that she sits alone at the table because she has outlived all her male guests who were her former lovers .
butler james assumes the role of each ' guest ' in order to toast miss sophie with champagne , wine , port and so on throughout the meal .
before each toast , he asks plaintively : " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " to which she responds , " the same procedure as every year , james . " the " same procedure " line is repeated one final time after dinner as butler james escorts miss sophie upstairs to bed , with frinton leering knowingly at the audience and affirming , " i 'll do me very best ! " the highest ratings the sketch was used as a new year 's eve filler on ndr television in hamburg in the early 1970s and it quickly became a regular part of german new year 's eve celebrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : butler james has wowed german viewers since 1963 over the years somehow , it has become a cult classic in germany - to the extent that it is shown on dozens of regional channels at some point over new year and ndr shows it six or seven times during new year 's eve . " it usually has the highest rating of any program shown during the year , " says jürgen meier-beer , ndr 's head of entertainment .
" we have an average market share in our area of 8 percent .
' dinner for one ' gets us up to 20 to 30 percent every time .
we reckon that one in every two viewers in our area will watch it at some point on new year 's eve . " in recent years , it has also been shown in austria , switzerland , denmark and other countries . ironically , frinton died long before his sketch made him a household name across central europe . getting in on the joke many germans are shocked to learn that the rest of the world is ignorant of this pearl of british humor . english-speaking visitors to germany are invariably flummoxed by continual references to this obscure sketch .
in a bid to make casual conversation , a german might ask , " what do you think of ' dinner for one ' ? " " ' dinner for one ' what , " is often the reply . " you know - ' dinner for one ' - ' james , miss sophie , same procedure as every year ? " '
and then they break into an uncontrolled fit of giggles . a silly moment of merriment also , germans are amazed that few people in britain under the age of 50 know who frinton was .
in fact , frinton was a master at playing comic drunks and had a huge following on british television in the 1950s . he was a bit past his prime when he taped the german version of his popular sketch .
viewed for the first time , the sketch seems dated and stale , an impression not helped by the fact that it was shot in black and white , and recorded on videotape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate hosts a showy new year 's party but what germans love about " dinner for one " is the fact that it is a silly moment of merriment that has become enshrined in the nation 's psyche .
people remember seeing it when they were young and with people who are no longer present , and they remember new year 's eves gone by . the sketch , of course , improves from repeated viewing , not unlike the rocky horror picture show .
and on new year 's eve , of course , many viewers have been raising their glasses in toasts all evening already and are as smashed as frinton 's character in the sketch .
that makes it easy for millions to slur the lines right along with the inebriated butler . never shown in britain what many people in germany do n't realize is that the sketch has never been shown in either britain or the us , though it has had a few showings on australian cable tv . but then , there are those german-language figures who are unknown in germany .
when a german asks what you think of " dinner for one , " one can respond by asking what they think of " the sound of music . " then the shoe will be on the other foot .
one can even launch into a rendition of the song , " edelweiss . "

" if we were to be satisfied with the first success that we 've had , then the economic upturn would turn in to a flash in the pan just like so often in the past , " according to a transcript of merkel 's speech which will be broadcast on german television on sunday evening . the chancellor , leader of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she was aware of the painful impact of some of her government 's reform policies but stressed that the current economic upswing and the fall in the number of jobless in 2006 showed that the government was on the right track . " that can only give us more encouragement , " merkel said . cutting unemployment will be priority in 2007 the chancellor 's speech also signals a rejection of calls by kurt beck , chairman of the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democrats , to slow down the pace of reform . this week , beck stirred debate by saying germans could not weather further reforms and that their endurance levels had been stretched to the maximum by painful social and economic reforms this year alone . however , merkel and her cdu colleagues as well as german president horst köhler , have strongly disputed beck 's comments , saying that structural reform was absolutely necessary if germany had to survive in the global marketplace and remain internationally competitive . merkel also underlined that her primary goal for 2007 would be to cut unemployment .
other aims , she said , would include streamlining the government budget , investing in education and research , improving energy efficiency and fighting climate change . referring to germany taking on both the eu and g8 presidencies on jan 1 , 2007 , merkel said that europe would work if every nation did their homework well .

" the 15-minute sketch , acted by freddie frinton and may warden , will also be televised by every other major regional public-tv channel in germany and by a scattering of commercial networks . the black-and-white british slapstick sketch , totally unknown in the english-speaking world , has become the highest-rated tv show in german history , and has spawned fan clubs and a cult following of viewers who stage parties to recreate the sketch at home . in a nation not exactly known for its ribaldry and thigh-slapping humor , the new year 's eve showing of " dinner for one " never fails to bring down the house .
there are viewers who have memorized every gesture , every line of the english-only sketch . same procedure … the mere mention of the tag-line , " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " will break the ice with the sternest of stern-faced germans .
mention that line , regardless of the situation , and be prepared for the german to reply with , " same procedure as every year , james , " and then collapse into hysterical laughter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks are an annual german tradition it is a phenomenon that has become ritualized into tradition .
" the dinner for one " sketch was originally performed in the 1920s in british music halls . in the early 1960s , a german television producer had caught the stage act in blackpool and invited frinton to fly back to hamburg with him to tape the sketch for a one-time broadcast in 1963 . studio employees and in-house secretaries served as the live audience for the sketch about a butler who gets riotously drunk while serving food and drinks to his employer , miss sophie , and her guests on her 90th birthday . the running joke is that she sits alone at the table because she has outlived all her male guests who were her former lovers .
butler james assumes the role of each ' guest ' in order to toast miss sophie with champagne , wine , port and so on throughout the meal .
before each toast , he asks plaintively : " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " to which she responds , " the same procedure as every year , james . " the " same procedure " line is repeated one final time after dinner as butler james escorts miss sophie upstairs to bed , with frinton leering knowingly at the audience and affirming , " i 'll do me very best ! " the highest ratings the sketch was used as a new year 's eve filler on ndr television in hamburg in the early 1970s and it quickly became a regular part of german new year 's eve celebrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : butler james has wowed german viewers since 1963 over the years somehow , it has become a cult classic in germany - to the extent that it is shown on dozens of regional channels at some point over new year and ndr shows it six or seven times during new year 's eve . " it usually has the highest rating of any program shown during the year , " says jürgen meier-beer , ndr 's head of entertainment .
" we have an average market share in our area of 8 percent .
' dinner for one ' gets us up to 20 to 30 percent every time .
we reckon that one in every two viewers in our area will watch it at some point on new year 's eve . " in recent years , it has also been shown in austria , switzerland , denmark and other countries . ironically , frinton died long before his sketch made him a household name across central europe . getting in on the joke many germans are shocked to learn that the rest of the world is ignorant of this pearl of british humor . english-speaking visitors to germany are invariably flummoxed by continual references to this obscure sketch .
in a bid to make casual conversation , a german might ask , " what do you think of ' dinner for one ' ? " " ' dinner for one ' what , " is often the reply . " you know - ' dinner for one ' - ' james , miss sophie , same procedure as every year ? " '
and then they break into an uncontrolled fit of giggles . a silly moment of merriment also , germans are amazed that few people in britain under the age of 50 know who frinton was .
in fact , frinton was a master at playing comic drunks and had a huge following on british television in the 1950s . he was a bit past his prime when he taped the german version of his popular sketch .
viewed for the first time , the sketch seems dated and stale , an impression not helped by the fact that it was shot in black and white , and recorded on videotape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate hosts a showy new year 's party but what germans love about " dinner for one " is the fact that it is a silly moment of merriment that has become enshrined in the nation 's psyche .
people remember seeing it when they were young and with people who are no longer present , and they remember new year 's eves gone by . the sketch , of course , improves from repeated viewing , not unlike the rocky horror picture show .
and on new year 's eve , of course , many viewers have been raising their glasses in toasts all evening already and are as smashed as frinton 's character in the sketch .
that makes it easy for millions to slur the lines right along with the inebriated butler . never shown in britain what many people in germany do n't realize is that the sketch has never been shown in either britain or the us , though it has had a few showings on australian cable tv . but then , there are those german-language figures who are unknown in germany .
when a german asks what you think of " dinner for one , " one can respond by asking what they think of " the sound of music . " then the shoe will be on the other foot .

" if we were to be satisfied with the first success that we 've had , then the economic upturn would turn in to a flash in the pan just like so often in the past , " according to a transcript of merkel 's speech which will be broadcast on german television on sunday evening . the chancellor , leader of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she was aware of the painful impact of some of her government 's reform policies but stressed that the current economic upswing and the fall in the number of jobless in 2006 showed that the government was on the right track . " that can only give us more encouragement , " merkel said . cutting unemployment will be priority in 2007 the chancellor 's speech also signals a rejection of calls by kurt beck , chairman of the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democrats , to slow down the pace of reform . this week , beck stirred debate by saying germans could not weather further reforms and that their endurance levels had been stretched to the maximum by painful social and economic reforms this year alone . however , merkel and her cdu colleagues as well as german president horst köhler , have strongly disputed beck 's comments , saying that structural reform was absolutely necessary if germany had to survive in the global marketplace and remain internationally competitive . merkel also underlined that her primary goal for 2007 would be to cut unemployment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 31.12.2006 europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein 's execution was the focus of newspapers across the world as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems . newspapers in europe , which on sunday caught up with broadcasters and the internet in focusing on former iraqi dictator saddam hussein 's execution for crimes against humanity , were largely in agreement that the hanging would do little to change things on the ground in iraq . the sunday telegraph in london said it would be " naive to think that his -lrb- saddam hussein 's -rrb- execution will end the growing sectarian violence that has gripped iraq since the us-led invasion toppled saddam in march 2003 . " but it conceded that the hanging " might sow a necessary seed of separation between " loyalists of the secular baath party that had ruled iraq for three decades and the islamist extremists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi state television broadcast graphic images of the execution " the execution has definitively robbed the former group of a symbolic figurehead and any hope of a recognizable baathist revival , " the right-leaning newspaper said in an editorial .
the dictator 's death " may yet open up a tiny chink of hope , " it concluded . the left-leaning independent on sunday said saddam 's execution defied moves worldwide in recent decades to scrap the death penalty and " can too easily be portrayed throughout the arab and muslim worlds as victor 's justice . " " this is not the beginning of a new iraq " the italian press also agreed that the execution had " divided the world " and would not " end the nightmare of the iraqis . " the business daily il sole 24 ore said " this is not the beginning of a new iraq , " while il messagero concluded that dialogue was urgently needed in iraq but " the necessary conditions to do not exist , and that death of saddam will not help this . " only the turin-based daily la stampa saw saddam 's death as " possibly a turning point for a country finally united by the disappearance of the person chiefly responsible for its ruin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iraqis were jubilant at news of the execution , but violence continued unabated spain 's respected daily el pais said that in executing saddam the iraqi government " lamentably succumbed to an easy temptation . " the government " may or may not gain greater public backing but the arab country is no better off today , nor is its future more promising with the elimination of the man from tikrit , " sadam 's hometown . " with the precipitate and quasi-clandestine hanging of the tyrant , baghdad has not just lost an opportunity to show magnanimity that iraq desperately needs if it is to have the least chink of home .
it has also lost the chance to carry on judging saddam for his crimes against humanity and expose to iraqis the truth behind his appalling reign in all its gore . " " now what ? " the german weekly bild am sonntag was similarly pessimistic , saying this was not a time for " joy or relief ... because saddam 's death does not solve any of the problems that the military campaign against him created . " the french sunday paper le journal du dimanche asked on its front page " and now what ? " " the condemnation of saddam hussein does not change anything on the ground , " it added . on saturday , most european nations , though condemning the former dictator 's crimes and his reign of terror , stridently criticized his execution , calling capital punishment cruel and barbaric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis grieve beside the grave of the former iraqi president saddam hussein in ouja , 130 kilometers north of baghdad european union reaction focused on opposition to the use of capital punishment as a matter of principle .
article two of the eu 's charter of basic human rights says no one " must be condemned to death or executed . " france , a staunch opponent of the iraq invasion , reiterated its opposition to capital punishment and " calls like all its european partners for the universal abolition of the death penalty , " the foreign ministry said . germany also reaffirmed its opposition to capital punishment while acknowledging that " thousands of innocents were killed and tortured " under the saddam regime . " the german government , like the rest of the european union , rejects capital punishment as a matter of principle in all circumstances , " a foreign ministry statement said . britain , the main us ally in iraq , said saddam had been " held to account " but reiterated its opposition to the death penalty . a " missed opportunity " for iraq italian prime minister romano prodi said he was concerned over tensions fanned in iraq by the execution . " from the first hours -lrb- following saddam 's hanging -rrb- we 've seen that the consequences have been an increase in tensions and violence , as you could have predicted , " prodi was quoted by ansa news agency as saying .
" i hope it wo n't continue , " he added . prodi on friday issued a final plea against saddam 's execution , saying " no fault can determine one man to be the bearer of death to another . " a statement by terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , europe 's top human rights body , described the trial as a " missed opportunity in a country which does not have many opportunities . " it was an opportunity for iraq to join the civilized world .
the former iraqi dictator was a ruthless criminal who deserved to be punished , but it was wrong to kill him , " davis said . what iraqis need is " justice , reconciliation and peace , not hangings and revenge . " dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel on hussein execution : " we respect the verdict " while accepting the iraqi decision to execute former dictator saddam hussein on saturday , german chancellor angela merkel and other european leaders voiced their opposition to the death penalty in principle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 31.12.2006 europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein 's execution was the focus of newspapers across the world as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems . newspapers in europe , which on sunday caught up with broadcasters and the internet in focusing on former iraqi dictator saddam hussein 's execution for crimes against humanity , were largely in agreement that the hanging would do little to change things on the ground in iraq . the sunday telegraph in london said it would be " naive to think that his -lrb- saddam hussein 's -rrb- execution will end the growing sectarian violence that has gripped iraq since the us-led invasion toppled saddam in march 2003 . " but it conceded that the hanging " might sow a necessary seed of separation between " loyalists of the secular baath party that had ruled iraq for three decades and the islamist extremists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi state television broadcast graphic images of the execution " the execution has definitively robbed the former group of a symbolic figurehead and any hope of a recognizable baathist revival , " the right-leaning newspaper said in an editorial .
the dictator 's death " may yet open up a tiny chink of hope , " it concluded . the left-leaning independent on sunday said saddam 's execution defied moves worldwide in recent decades to scrap the death penalty and " can too easily be portrayed throughout the arab and muslim worlds as victor 's justice . " " this is not the beginning of a new iraq " the italian press also agreed that the execution had " divided the world " and would not " end the nightmare of the iraqis . " the business daily il sole 24 ore said " this is not the beginning of a new iraq , " while il messagero concluded that dialogue was urgently needed in iraq but " the necessary conditions to do not exist , and that death of saddam will not help this . " only the turin-based daily la stampa saw saddam 's death as " possibly a turning point for a country finally united by the disappearance of the person chiefly responsible for its ruin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iraqis were jubilant at news of the execution , but violence continued unabated spain 's respected daily el pais said that in executing saddam the iraqi government " lamentably succumbed to an easy temptation . " the government " may or may not gain greater public backing but the arab country is no better off today , nor is its future more promising with the elimination of the man from tikrit , " sadam 's hometown . " with the precipitate and quasi-clandestine hanging of the tyrant , baghdad has not just lost an opportunity to show magnanimity that iraq desperately needs if it is to have the least chink of home .
it has also lost the chance to carry on judging saddam for his crimes against humanity and expose to iraqis the truth behind his appalling reign in all its gore . " " now what ? " the german weekly bild am sonntag was similarly pessimistic , saying this was not a time for " joy or relief ... because saddam 's death does not solve any of the problems that the military campaign against him created . " the french sunday paper le journal du dimanche asked on its front page " and now what ? " " the condemnation of saddam hussein does not change anything on the ground , " it added . on saturday , most european nations , though condemning the former dictator 's crimes and his reign of terror , stridently criticized his execution , calling capital punishment cruel and barbaric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis grieve beside the grave of the former iraqi president saddam hussein in ouja , 130 kilometers north of baghdad european union reaction focused on opposition to the use of capital punishment as a matter of principle .
article two of the eu 's charter of basic human rights says no one " must be condemned to death or executed . " france , a staunch opponent of the iraq invasion , reiterated its opposition to capital punishment and " calls like all its european partners for the universal abolition of the death penalty , " the foreign ministry said . germany also reaffirmed its opposition to capital punishment while acknowledging that " thousands of innocents were killed and tortured " under the saddam regime . " the german government , like the rest of the european union , rejects capital punishment as a matter of principle in all circumstances , " a foreign ministry statement said . britain , the main us ally in iraq , said saddam had been " held to account " but reiterated its opposition to the death penalty . a " missed opportunity " for iraq italian prime minister romano prodi said he was concerned over tensions fanned in iraq by the execution . " from the first hours -lrb- following saddam 's hanging -rrb- we 've seen that the consequences have been an increase in tensions and violence , as you could have predicted , " prodi was quoted by ansa news agency as saying .
" i hope it wo n't continue , " he added . prodi on friday issued a final plea against saddam 's execution , saying " no fault can determine one man to be the bearer of death to another . " a statement by terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , europe 's top human rights body , described the trial as a " missed opportunity in a country which does not have many opportunities . " it was an opportunity for iraq to join the civilized world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 31.12.2006 europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein 's execution was the focus of newspapers across the world as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems . newspapers in europe , which on sunday caught up with broadcasters and the internet in focusing on former iraqi dictator saddam hussein 's execution for crimes against humanity , were largely in agreement that the hanging would do little to change things on the ground in iraq . the sunday telegraph in london said it would be " naive to think that his -lrb- saddam hussein 's -rrb- execution will end the growing sectarian violence that has gripped iraq since the us-led invasion toppled saddam in march 2003 . " but it conceded that the hanging " might sow a necessary seed of separation between " loyalists of the secular baath party that had ruled iraq for three decades and the islamist extremists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi state television broadcast graphic images of the execution " the execution has definitively robbed the former group of a symbolic figurehead and any hope of a recognizable baathist revival , " the right-leaning newspaper said in an editorial .
the dictator 's death " may yet open up a tiny chink of hope , " it concluded . the left-leaning independent on sunday said saddam 's execution defied moves worldwide in recent decades to scrap the death penalty and " can too easily be portrayed throughout the arab and muslim worlds as victor 's justice . " " this is not the beginning of a new iraq " the italian press also agreed that the execution had " divided the world " and would not " end the nightmare of the iraqis . " the business daily il sole 24 ore said " this is not the beginning of a new iraq , " while il messagero concluded that dialogue was urgently needed in iraq but " the necessary conditions to do not exist , and that death of saddam will not help this . " only the turin-based daily la stampa saw saddam 's death as " possibly a turning point for a country finally united by the disappearance of the person chiefly responsible for its ruin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iraqis were jubilant at news of the execution , but violence continued unabated spain 's respected daily el pais said that in executing saddam the iraqi government " lamentably succumbed to an easy temptation . " the government " may or may not gain greater public backing but the arab country is no better off today , nor is its future more promising with the elimination of the man from tikrit , " sadam 's hometown . " with the precipitate and quasi-clandestine hanging of the tyrant , baghdad has not just lost an opportunity to show magnanimity that iraq desperately needs if it is to have the least chink of home .
it has also lost the chance to carry on judging saddam for his crimes against humanity and expose to iraqis the truth behind his appalling reign in all its gore . " " now what ? " the german weekly bild am sonntag was similarly pessimistic , saying this was not a time for " joy or relief ... because saddam 's death does not solve any of the problems that the military campaign against him created . " the french sunday paper le journal du dimanche asked on its front page " and now what ? " " the condemnation of saddam hussein does not change anything on the ground , " it added . on saturday , most european nations , though condemning the former dictator 's crimes and his reign of terror , stridently criticized his execution , calling capital punishment cruel and barbaric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis grieve beside the grave of the former iraqi president saddam hussein in ouja , 130 kilometers north of baghdad european union reaction focused on opposition to the use of capital punishment as a matter of principle .
article two of the eu 's charter of basic human rights says no one " must be condemned to death or executed . " france , a staunch opponent of the iraq invasion , reiterated its opposition to capital punishment and " calls like all its european partners for the universal abolition of the death penalty , " the foreign ministry said . germany also reaffirmed its opposition to capital punishment while acknowledging that " thousands of innocents were killed and tortured " under the saddam regime . " the german government , like the rest of the european union , rejects capital punishment as a matter of principle in all circumstances , " a foreign ministry statement said . britain , the main us ally in iraq , said saddam had been " held to account " but reiterated its opposition to the death penalty . a " missed opportunity " for iraq italian prime minister romano prodi said he was concerned over tensions fanned in iraq by the execution . " from the first hours -lrb- following saddam 's hanging -rrb- we 've seen that the consequences have been an increase in tensions and violence , as you could have predicted , " prodi was quoted by ansa news agency as saying .
" i hope it wo n't continue , " he added . prodi on friday issued a final plea against saddam 's execution , saying " no fault can determine one man to be the bearer of death to another . " a statement by terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , europe 's top human rights body , described the trial as a " missed opportunity in a country which does not have many opportunities . " it was an opportunity for iraq to join the civilized world .
the former iraqi dictator was a ruthless criminal who deserved to be punished , but it was wrong to kill him , " davis said . what iraqis need is " justice , reconciliation and peace , not hangings and revenge .

" if we were to be satisfied with the first success that we 've had , then the economic upturn would turn in to a flash in the pan just like so often in the past , " according to a transcript of merkel 's speech which will be broadcast on german television on sunday evening . the chancellor , leader of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she was aware of the painful impact of some of her government 's reform policies but stressed that the current economic upswing and the fall in the number of jobless in 2006 showed that the government was on the right track . " that can only give us more encouragement , " merkel said . cutting unemployment will be priority in 2007 the chancellor 's speech also signals a rejection of calls by kurt beck , chairman of the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democrats , to slow down the pace of reform . this week , beck stirred debate by saying germans could not weather further reforms and that their endurance levels had been stretched to the maximum by painful social and economic reforms this year alone . however , merkel and her cdu colleagues as well as german president horst köhler , have strongly disputed beck 's comments , saying that structural reform was absolutely necessary if germany had to survive in the global marketplace and remain internationally competitive . merkel also underlined that her primary goal for 2007 would be to cut unemployment .
other aims , she said , would include streamlining the government budget , investing in education and research , improving energy efficiency and fighting climate change . referring to germany taking on both the eu and g8 presidencies on jan 1 , 2007 , merkel said that europe would work if every nation did their homework well . " we 'll have to work twice as hard in 2007 - for progress in europe and for the continuation of the economic upturn in germany , " she said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrat leader warns against too many reforms the chairman of germany 's social democratic party , kurt beck , said that the painful social and economic reforms introduced by chancellor angela merkel had hurt germans badly and that people wouldn ’ t accept more .

now , its makers are hoping for a comeback . once referred to as the ferrari of the east , the low-slung , wing-doored melkus rs 1000 sports car was a proud and popular speedster during the communist era . not that there were many of them available .
only 101 of the sleek , drop-nosed racers were made between 1969 and 1979 -lrb- today just 80 of them are in shape to be driven -rrb- .
after 1979 , the family firm was forced to halt production due to a plunge in the east 's economy . built from old parts the car was the brainchild of heinz melkus , a city driving school operator and himself a fanatic sports car enthusiast in the 1960s and 70s .
the original rs 1000 cars were sleek in appearance , and might have been plucked out of a james bond movie - had their performance matched their looks . molded out of fiberglass , and assembled from parts of the famous put-putting east german trabant , they were dependent on the 75 horse power , two stroke engines taken from the ir wartburg 353 sedan .
they could reach a top speed of 102 miles per hour . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter melkus , the son of original designer hanz , has brought the car back east german sports car enthusiasts loved the melkus rs1000 , and mourned its passing .
now , 27 years after communist east germany 's only sports car went out of production , it is aiming for a comeback . unveiling in dresden currently , a five-man-strong dresden firm headed by peter melkus , the son of heinz who died aged 78 last year , is involved in a relaunch of the car . " we plan to complete 15 of the melkus rs 1000s , costing 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 66,238 -rrb- , by the end of 2007 , " explained peter melkus , the son of heinz , who died last year at age 78 .
" a dozen of them have already found owners . " heinz melkus ' 23-year-old grandson , sepp , told german news agency dpa that the first of the revamped sports cars based on the original was recently unveiled at the dresden transport museum . " owners of several of the original rs 100s showed up for the occasion in their vehicles , which added to the atmosphere , " said sepp . only 101 ever made according to sepp , his grandfather built the first sports cars in the 1960s after he was overtaken on the highway in 1969 by a sleek looking lotus , on a drive to yugoslavia . although individual private enterprise was n't allowed in the communist state as such , east germany was gearing up to celebrate its 20th anniversary at the time and the authorities surprisingly agreed . all told , 101 of the melkus rs 100s were made between 1969 to 1979 by heinz melkus and a handful of assistants who worked out of a garage near his dresden home .
they were built from segments of trabants and wartburgs , secured from factories and junkyards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rs 1000 is built from the trabent , which has an even broader cult following at the same time , hans melkus gained growing recognition throughout eastern europe as a racing driver .

" the 15-minute sketch , acted by freddie frinton and may warden , will also be televised by every other major regional public-tv channel in germany and by a scattering of commercial networks . the black-and-white british slapstick sketch , totally unknown in the english-speaking world , has become the highest-rated tv show in german history , and has spawned fan clubs and a cult following of viewers who stage parties to recreate the sketch at home . in a nation not exactly known for its ribaldry and thigh-slapping humor , the new year 's eve showing of " dinner for one " never fails to bring down the house .
there are viewers who have memorized every gesture , every line of the english-only sketch . same procedure … the mere mention of the tag-line , " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " will break the ice with the sternest of stern-faced germans .
mention that line , regardless of the situation , and be prepared for the german to reply with , " same procedure as every year , james , " and then collapse into hysterical laughter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks are an annual german tradition it is a phenomenon that has become ritualized into tradition .
" the dinner for one " sketch was originally performed in the 1920s in british music halls . in the early 1960s , a german television producer had caught the stage act in blackpool and invited frinton to fly back to hamburg with him to tape the sketch for a one-time broadcast in 1963 . studio employees and in-house secretaries served as the live audience for the sketch about a butler who gets riotously drunk while serving food and drinks to his employer , miss sophie , and her guests on her 90th birthday . the running joke is that she sits alone at the table because she has outlived all her male guests who were her former lovers .
butler james assumes the role of each ' guest ' in order to toast miss sophie with champagne , wine , port and so on throughout the meal .
before each toast , he asks plaintively : " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " to which she responds , " the same procedure as every year , james . " the " same procedure " line is repeated one final time after dinner as butler james escorts miss sophie upstairs to bed , with frinton leering knowingly at the audience and affirming , " i 'll do me very best ! " the highest ratings the sketch was used as a new year 's eve filler on ndr television in hamburg in the early 1970s and it quickly became a regular part of german new year 's eve celebrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : butler james has wowed german viewers since 1963 over the years somehow , it has become a cult classic in germany - to the extent that it is shown on dozens of regional channels at some point over new year and ndr shows it six or seven times during new year 's eve . " it usually has the highest rating of any program shown during the year , " says jürgen meier-beer , ndr 's head of entertainment .
" we have an average market share in our area of 8 percent .
' dinner for one ' gets us up to 20 to 30 percent every time .
we reckon that one in every two viewers in our area will watch it at some point on new year 's eve . " in recent years , it has also been shown in austria , switzerland , denmark and other countries . ironically , frinton died long before his sketch made him a household name across central europe . getting in on the joke many germans are shocked to learn that the rest of the world is ignorant of this pearl of british humor . english-speaking visitors to germany are invariably flummoxed by continual references to this obscure sketch .
in a bid to make casual conversation , a german might ask , " what do you think of ' dinner for one ' ? " " ' dinner for one ' what , " is often the reply . " you know - ' dinner for one ' - ' james , miss sophie , same procedure as every year ? " '
and then they break into an uncontrolled fit of giggles . a silly moment of merriment also , germans are amazed that few people in britain under the age of 50 know who frinton was .
in fact , frinton was a master at playing comic drunks and had a huge following on british television in the 1950s . he was a bit past his prime when he taped the german version of his popular sketch .
viewed for the first time , the sketch seems dated and stale , an impression not helped by the fact that it was shot in black and white , and recorded on videotape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate hosts a showy new year 's party but what germans love about " dinner for one " is the fact that it is a silly moment of merriment that has become enshrined in the nation 's psyche .
people remember seeing it when they were young and with people who are no longer present , and they remember new year 's eves gone by . the sketch , of course , improves from repeated viewing , not unlike the rocky horror picture show .
and on new year 's eve , of course , many viewers have been raising their glasses in toasts all evening already and are as smashed as frinton 's character in the sketch .
that makes it easy for millions to slur the lines right along with the inebriated butler . never shown in britain what many people in germany do n't realize is that the sketch has never been shown in either britain or the us , though it has had a few showings on australian cable tv . but then , there are those german-language figures who are unknown in germany .
when a german asks what you think of " dinner for one , " one can respond by asking what they think of " the sound of music . " then the shoe will be on the other foot .
one can even launch into a rendition of the song , " edelweiss . "

that makes it easy for millions to slur the lines right along with the inebriated butler . never shown in britain what many people in germany do n't realize is that the sketch has never been shown in either britain or the us , though it has had a few showings on australian cable tv . but then , there are those german-language figures who are unknown in germany .
when a german asks what you think of " dinner for one , " one can respond by asking what they think of " the sound of music . " then the shoe will be on the other foot .
one can even launch into a rendition of the song , " edelweiss . "

" if we were to be satisfied with the first success that we 've had , then the economic upturn would turn in to a flash in the pan just like so often in the past , " according to a transcript of merkel 's speech which will be broadcast on german television on sunday evening . the chancellor , leader of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she was aware of the painful impact of some of her government 's reform policies but stressed that the current economic upswing and the fall in the number of jobless in 2006 showed that the government was on the right track . " that can only give us more encouragement , " merkel said . cutting unemployment will be priority in 2007 the chancellor 's speech also signals a rejection of calls by kurt beck , chairman of the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democrats , to slow down the pace of reform . this week , beck stirred debate by saying germans could not weather further reforms and that their endurance levels had been stretched to the maximum by painful social and economic reforms this year alone . however , merkel and her cdu colleagues as well as german president horst köhler , have strongly disputed beck 's comments , saying that structural reform was absolutely necessary if germany had to survive in the global marketplace and remain internationally competitive . merkel also underlined that her primary goal for 2007 would be to cut unemployment .
other aims , she said , would include streamlining the government budget , investing in education and research , improving energy efficiency and fighting climate change . referring to germany taking on both the eu and g8 presidencies on jan 1 , 2007 , merkel said that europe would work if every nation did their homework well . " we 'll have to work twice as hard in 2007 - for progress in europe and for the continuation of the economic upturn in germany , " she said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrat leader warns against too many reforms the chairman of germany 's social democratic party , kurt beck , said that the painful social and economic reforms introduced by chancellor angela merkel had hurt germans badly and that people wouldn ’ t accept more .

now , its makers are hoping for a comeback . once referred to as the ferrari of the east , the low-slung , wing-doored melkus rs 1000 sports car was a proud and popular speedster during the communist era . not that there were many of them available .
only 101 of the sleek , drop-nosed racers were made between 1969 and 1979 -lrb- today just 80 of them are in shape to be driven -rrb- .
after 1979 , the family firm was forced to halt production due to a plunge in the east 's economy . built from old parts the car was the brainchild of heinz melkus , a city driving school operator and himself a fanatic sports car enthusiast in the 1960s and 70s .
the original rs 1000 cars were sleek in appearance , and might have been plucked out of a james bond movie - had their performance matched their looks . molded out of fiberglass , and assembled from parts of the famous put-putting east german trabant , they were dependent on the 75 horse power , two stroke engines taken from the ir wartburg 353 sedan .
they could reach a top speed of 102 miles per hour . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter melkus , the son of original designer hanz , has brought the car back east german sports car enthusiasts loved the melkus rs1000 , and mourned its passing .
now , 27 years after communist east germany 's only sports car went out of production , it is aiming for a comeback . unveiling in dresden currently , a five-man-strong dresden firm headed by peter melkus , the son of heinz who died aged 78 last year , is involved in a relaunch of the car . " we plan to complete 15 of the melkus rs 1000s , costing 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 66,238 -rrb- , by the end of 2007 , " explained peter melkus , the son of heinz , who died last year at age 78 .
" a dozen of them have already found owners . " heinz melkus ' 23-year-old grandson , sepp , told german news agency dpa that the first of the revamped sports cars based on the original was recently unveiled at the dresden transport museum . " owners of several of the original rs 100s showed up for the occasion in their vehicles , which added to the atmosphere , " said sepp . only 101 ever made according to sepp , his grandfather built the first sports cars in the 1960s after he was overtaken on the highway in 1969 by a sleek looking lotus , on a drive to yugoslavia . although individual private enterprise was n't allowed in the communist state as such , east germany was gearing up to celebrate its 20th anniversary at the time and the authorities surprisingly agreed . all told , 101 of the melkus rs 100s were made between 1969 to 1979 by heinz melkus and a handful of assistants who worked out of a garage near his dresden home .
they were built from segments of trabants and wartburgs , secured from factories and junkyards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rs 1000 is built from the trabent , which has an even broader cult following at the same time , hans melkus gained growing recognition throughout eastern europe as a racing driver .
east germany 's equivalent of michael schumacher , he won 80 grand prix events and at the height of his fame was the holder of the peace and friendship cup , the state 's top motor-racing trophy . plans for new version but melkus 's grandson said the 15 melkus rs 1000s will be the last of their kind to be made by the dresden company . " once we have completed our remake of the original , we have plans to embark on the next generation - the melkus rs 2000 , " he said .
the cars are expected to sell for 70,000 euros . during its 40-year history , the east germany was hardly a car owners ' paradise .
citizens had to wait up to 10 years before obtaining the two-stroke , smoke-puffing trabant - popularly known as " trabi " - and up to 15 years for the boxy wartburg sedan . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trabis enjoy cult status in former east germany nearly 50 years after the first model rolled off the production lines , the car that became a symbol of east germany can still be seen pottering along german roads .

now , its makers are hoping for a comeback . once referred to as the ferrari of the east , the low-slung , wing-doored melkus rs 1000 sports car was a proud and popular speedster during the communist era . not that there were many of them available .
only 101 of the sleek , drop-nosed racers were made between 1969 and 1979 -lrb- today just 80 of them are in shape to be driven -rrb- .
after 1979 , the family firm was forced to halt production due to a plunge in the east 's economy . built from old parts the car was the brainchild of heinz melkus , a city driving school operator and himself a fanatic sports car enthusiast in the 1960s and 70s .
the original rs 1000 cars were sleek in appearance , and might have been plucked out of a james bond movie - had their performance matched their looks . molded out of fiberglass , and assembled from parts of the famous put-putting east german trabant , they were dependent on the 75 horse power , two stroke engines taken from the ir wartburg 353 sedan .
they could reach a top speed of 102 miles per hour . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter melkus , the son of original designer hanz , has brought the car back east german sports car enthusiasts loved the melkus rs1000 , and mourned its passing .
now , 27 years after communist east germany 's only sports car went out of production , it is aiming for a comeback . unveiling in dresden currently , a five-man-strong dresden firm headed by peter melkus , the son of heinz who died aged 78 last year , is involved in a relaunch of the car . " we plan to complete 15 of the melkus rs 1000s , costing 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 66,238 -rrb- , by the end of 2007 , " explained peter melkus , the son of heinz , who died last year at age 78 .
" a dozen of them have already found owners . " heinz melkus ' 23-year-old grandson , sepp , told german news agency dpa that the first of the revamped sports cars based on the original was recently unveiled at the dresden transport museum . " owners of several of the original rs 100s showed up for the occasion in their vehicles , which added to the atmosphere , " said sepp . only 101 ever made according to sepp , his grandfather built the first sports cars in the 1960s after he was overtaken on the highway in 1969 by a sleek looking lotus , on a drive to yugoslavia . although individual private enterprise was n't allowed in the communist state as such , east germany was gearing up to celebrate its 20th anniversary at the time and the authorities surprisingly agreed . all told , 101 of the melkus rs 100s were made between 1969 to 1979 by heinz melkus and a handful of assistants who worked out of a garage near his dresden home .
they were built from segments of trabants and wartburgs , secured from factories and junkyards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rs 1000 is built from the trabent , which has an even broader cult following at the same time , hans melkus gained growing recognition throughout eastern europe as a racing driver .
east germany 's equivalent of michael schumacher , he won 80 grand prix events and at the height of his fame was the holder of the peace and friendship cup , the state 's top motor-racing trophy . plans for new version but melkus 's grandson said the 15 melkus rs 1000s will be the last of their kind to be made by the dresden company . " once we have completed our remake of the original , we have plans to embark on the next generation - the melkus rs 2000 , " he said .
the cars are expected to sell for 70,000 euros . during its 40-year history , the east germany was hardly a car owners ' paradise .
citizens had to wait up to 10 years before obtaining the two-stroke , smoke-puffing trabant - popularly known as " trabi " - and up to 15 years for the boxy wartburg sedan . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trabis enjoy cult status in former east germany nearly 50 years after the first model rolled off the production lines , the car that became a symbol of east germany can still be seen pottering along german roads .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.12.2006 dinner for one : a german new year 's eve ritual großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miss sophie and butler , james have been regaling german audiences for years a classic tv sketch of a senile british woman and her drunk butler at her 90th birthday party thrills millions of germans every new year 's eve . millions of germans and other continental europeans will settle down in front of their tv sets on new year 's eve for what has become an annual ritual - the airing of an aged british comedy sketch starring a long-dead music-hall comedy called " dinner for one . " the 15-minute sketch , acted by freddie frinton and may warden , will also be televised by every other major regional public-tv channel in germany and by a scattering of commercial networks . the black-and-white british slapstick sketch , totally unknown in the english-speaking world , has become the highest-rated tv show in german history , and has spawned fan clubs and a cult following of viewers who stage parties to recreate the sketch at home . in a nation not exactly known for its ribaldry and thigh-slapping humor , the new year 's eve showing of " dinner for one " never fails to bring down the house .
there are viewers who have memorized every gesture , every line of the english-only sketch . same procedure … the mere mention of the tag-line , " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " will break the ice with the sternest of stern-faced germans .
mention that line , regardless of the situation , and be prepared for the german to reply with , " same procedure as every year , james , " and then collapse into hysterical laughter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks are an annual german tradition it is a phenomenon that has become ritualized into tradition .
" the dinner for one " sketch was originally performed in the 1920s in british music halls . in the early 1960s , a german television producer had caught the stage act in blackpool and invited frinton to fly back to hamburg with him to tape the sketch for a one-time broadcast in 1963 . studio employees and in-house secretaries served as the live audience for the sketch about a butler who gets riotously drunk while serving food and drinks to his employer , miss sophie , and her guests on her 90th birthday . the running joke is that she sits alone at the table because she has outlived all her male guests who were her former lovers .
butler james assumes the role of each ' guest ' in order to toast miss sophie with champagne , wine , port and so on throughout the meal .
before each toast , he asks plaintively : " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " to which she responds , " the same procedure as every year , james . " the " same procedure " line is repeated one final time after dinner as butler james escorts miss sophie upstairs to bed , with frinton leering knowingly at the audience and affirming , " i 'll do me very best ! " the highest ratings the sketch was used as a new year 's eve filler on ndr television in hamburg in the early 1970s and it quickly became a regular part of german new year 's eve celebrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : butler james has wowed german viewers since 1963 over the years somehow , it has become a cult classic in germany - to the extent that it is shown on dozens of regional channels at some point over new year and ndr shows it six or seven times during new year 's eve . " it usually has the highest rating of any program shown during the year , " says jürgen meier-beer , ndr 's head of entertainment .
" we have an average market share in our area of 8 percent .
' dinner for one ' gets us up to 20 to 30 percent every time .
we reckon that one in every two viewers in our area will watch it at some point on new year 's eve . " in recent years , it has also been shown in austria , switzerland , denmark and other countries . ironically , frinton died long before his sketch made him a household name across central europe . getting in on the joke many germans are shocked to learn that the rest of the world is ignorant of this pearl of british humor . english-speaking visitors to germany are invariably flummoxed by continual references to this obscure sketch .
in a bid to make casual conversation , a german might ask , " what do you think of ' dinner for one ' ? " " ' dinner for one ' what , " is often the reply . " you know - ' dinner for one ' - ' james , miss sophie , same procedure as every year ? " '
and then they break into an uncontrolled fit of giggles . a silly moment of merriment also , germans are amazed that few people in britain under the age of 50 know who frinton was .
in fact , frinton was a master at playing comic drunks and had a huge following on british television in the 1950s . he was a bit past his prime when he taped the german version of his popular sketch .
viewed for the first time , the sketch seems dated and stale , an impression not helped by the fact that it was shot in black and white , and recorded on videotape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate hosts a showy new year 's party but what germans love about " dinner for one " is the fact that it is a silly moment of merriment that has become enshrined in the nation 's psyche .
people remember seeing it when they were young and with people who are no longer present , and they remember new year 's eves gone by . the sketch , of course , improves from repeated viewing , not unlike the rocky horror picture show .
and on new year 's eve , of course , many viewers have been raising their glasses in toasts all evening already and are as smashed as frinton 's character in the sketch .
that makes it easy for millions to slur the lines right along with the inebriated butler . never shown in britain what many people in germany do n't realize is that the sketch has never been shown in either britain or the us , though it has had a few showings on australian cable tv . but then , there are those german-language figures who are unknown in germany .
when a german asks what you think of " dinner for one , " one can respond by asking what they think of " the sound of music . " then the shoe will be on the other foot .
one can even launch into a rendition of the song , " edelweiss . "

" but it conceded that the hanging " might sow a necessary seed of separation between " loyalists of the secular baath party that had ruled iraq for three decades and the islamist extremists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi state television broadcast graphic images of the execution " the execution has definitively robbed the former group of a symbolic figurehead and any hope of a recognizable baathist revival , " the right-leaning newspaper said in an editorial .
the dictator 's death " may yet open up a tiny chink of hope , " it concluded . the left-leaning independent on sunday said saddam 's execution defied moves worldwide in recent decades to scrap the death penalty and " can too easily be portrayed throughout the arab and muslim worlds as victor 's justice . " " this is not the beginning of a new iraq " the italian press also agreed that the execution had " divided the world " and would not " end the nightmare of the iraqis . " the business daily il sole 24 ore said " this is not the beginning of a new iraq , " while il messagero concluded that dialogue was urgently needed in iraq but " the necessary conditions to do not exist , and that death of saddam will not help this . " only the turin-based daily la stampa saw saddam 's death as " possibly a turning point for a country finally united by the disappearance of the person chiefly responsible for its ruin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iraqis were jubilant at news of the execution , but violence continued unabated spain 's respected daily el pais said that in executing saddam the iraqi government " lamentably succumbed to an easy temptation . " the government " may or may not gain greater public backing but the arab country is no better off today , nor is its future more promising with the elimination of the man from tikrit , " sadam 's hometown .

" if we were to be satisfied with the first success that we 've had , then the economic upturn would turn in to a flash in the pan just like so often in the past , " according to a transcript of merkel 's speech which will be broadcast on german television on sunday evening . the chancellor , leader of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she was aware of the painful impact of some of her government 's reform policies but stressed that the current economic upswing and the fall in the number of jobless in 2006 showed that the government was on the right track . " that can only give us more encouragement , " merkel said . cutting unemployment will be priority in 2007 the chancellor 's speech also signals a rejection of calls by kurt beck , chairman of the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democrats , to slow down the pace of reform . this week , beck stirred debate by saying germans could not weather further reforms and that their endurance levels had been stretched to the maximum by painful social and economic reforms this year alone . however , merkel and her cdu colleagues as well as german president horst köhler , have strongly disputed beck 's comments , saying that structural reform was absolutely necessary if germany had to survive in the global marketplace and remain internationally competitive . merkel also underlined that her primary goal for 2007 would be to cut unemployment .
other aims , she said , would include streamlining the government budget , investing in education and research , improving energy efficiency and fighting climate change . referring to germany taking on both the eu and g8 presidencies on jan 1 , 2007 , merkel said that europe would work if every nation did their homework well . " we 'll have to work twice as hard in 2007 - for progress in europe and for the continuation of the economic upturn in germany , " she said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrat leader warns against too many reforms the chairman of germany 's social democratic party , kurt beck , said that the painful social and economic reforms introduced by chancellor angela merkel had hurt germans badly and that people wouldn ’ t accept more .

" the 15-minute sketch , acted by freddie frinton and may warden , will also be televised by every other major regional public-tv channel in germany and by a scattering of commercial networks . the black-and-white british slapstick sketch , totally unknown in the english-speaking world , has become the highest-rated tv show in german history , and has spawned fan clubs and a cult following of viewers who stage parties to recreate the sketch at home . in a nation not exactly known for its ribaldry and thigh-slapping humor , the new year 's eve showing of " dinner for one " never fails to bring down the house .
there are viewers who have memorized every gesture , every line of the english-only sketch . same procedure … the mere mention of the tag-line , " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " will break the ice with the sternest of stern-faced germans .
mention that line , regardless of the situation , and be prepared for the german to reply with , " same procedure as every year , james , " and then collapse into hysterical laughter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks are an annual german tradition it is a phenomenon that has become ritualized into tradition .
" the dinner for one " sketch was originally performed in the 1920s in british music halls . in the early 1960s , a german television producer had caught the stage act in blackpool and invited frinton to fly back to hamburg with him to tape the sketch for a one-time broadcast in 1963 . studio employees and in-house secretaries served as the live audience for the sketch about a butler who gets riotously drunk while serving food and drinks to his employer , miss sophie , and her guests on her 90th birthday . the running joke is that she sits alone at the table because she has outlived all her male guests who were her former lovers .
butler james assumes the role of each ' guest ' in order to toast miss sophie with champagne , wine , port and so on throughout the meal .
before each toast , he asks plaintively : " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " to which she responds , " the same procedure as every year , james . " the " same procedure " line is repeated one final time after dinner as butler james escorts miss sophie upstairs to bed , with frinton leering knowingly at the audience and affirming , " i 'll do me very best ! " the highest ratings the sketch was used as a new year 's eve filler on ndr television in hamburg in the early 1970s and it quickly became a regular part of german new year 's eve celebrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : butler james has wowed german viewers since 1963 over the years somehow , it has become a cult classic in germany - to the extent that it is shown on dozens of regional channels at some point over new year and ndr shows it six or seven times during new year 's eve . " it usually has the highest rating of any program shown during the year , " says jürgen meier-beer , ndr 's head of entertainment .
" we have an average market share in our area of 8 percent .

and then they break into an uncontrolled fit of giggles . a silly moment of merriment also , germans are amazed that few people in britain under the age of 50 know who frinton was .
in fact , frinton was a master at playing comic drunks and had a huge following on british television in the 1950s . he was a bit past his prime when he taped the german version of his popular sketch .

" the 15-minute sketch , acted by freddie frinton and may warden , will also be televised by every other major regional public-tv channel in germany and by a scattering of commercial networks . the black-and-white british slapstick sketch , totally unknown in the english-speaking world , has become the highest-rated tv show in german history , and has spawned fan clubs and a cult following of viewers who stage parties to recreate the sketch at home . in a nation not exactly known for its ribaldry and thigh-slapping humor , the new year 's eve showing of " dinner for one " never fails to bring down the house .
there are viewers who have memorized every gesture , every line of the english-only sketch . same procedure … the mere mention of the tag-line , " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " will break the ice with the sternest of stern-faced germans .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks are an annual german tradition it is a phenomenon that has become ritualized into tradition .
" the dinner for one " sketch was originally performed in the 1920s in british music halls . in the early 1960s , a german television producer had caught the stage act in blackpool and invited frinton to fly back to hamburg with him to tape the sketch for a one-time broadcast in 1963 . studio employees and in-house secretaries served as the live audience for the sketch about a butler who gets riotously drunk while serving food and drinks to his employer , miss sophie , and her guests on her 90th birthday . the running joke is that she sits alone at the table because she has outlived all her male guests who were her former lovers .
butler james assumes the role of each ' guest ' in order to toast miss sophie with champagne , wine , port and so on throughout the meal .
before each toast , he asks plaintively : " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " to which she responds , " the same procedure as every year , james . " the " same procedure " line is repeated one final time after dinner as butler james escorts miss sophie upstairs to bed , with frinton leering knowingly at the audience and affirming , " i 'll do me very best ! " the highest ratings the sketch was used as a new year 's eve filler on ndr television in hamburg in the early 1970s and it quickly became a regular part of german new year 's eve celebrations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 31.12.2006 europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein 's execution was the focus of newspapers across the world as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems . newspapers in europe , which on sunday caught up with broadcasters and the internet in focusing on former iraqi dictator saddam hussein 's execution for crimes against humanity , were largely in agreement that the hanging would do little to change things on the ground in iraq . the sunday telegraph in london said it would be " naive to think that his -lrb- saddam hussein 's -rrb- execution will end the growing sectarian violence that has gripped iraq since the us-led invasion toppled saddam in march 2003 . " but it conceded that the hanging " might sow a necessary seed of separation between " loyalists of the secular baath party that had ruled iraq for three decades and the islamist extremists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi state television broadcast graphic images of the execution " the execution has definitively robbed the former group of a symbolic figurehead and any hope of a recognizable baathist revival , " the right-leaning newspaper said in an editorial .
the dictator 's death " may yet open up a tiny chink of hope , " it concluded . the left-leaning independent on sunday said saddam 's execution defied moves worldwide in recent decades to scrap the death penalty and " can too easily be portrayed throughout the arab and muslim worlds as victor 's justice . " " this is not the beginning of a new iraq " the italian press also agreed that the execution had " divided the world " and would not " end the nightmare of the iraqis . " the business daily il sole 24 ore said " this is not the beginning of a new iraq , " while il messagero concluded that dialogue was urgently needed in iraq but " the necessary conditions to do not exist , and that death of saddam will not help this . " only the turin-based daily la stampa saw saddam 's death as " possibly a turning point for a country finally united by the disappearance of the person chiefly responsible for its ruin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iraqis were jubilant at news of the execution , but violence continued unabated spain 's respected daily el pais said that in executing saddam the iraqi government " lamentably succumbed to an easy temptation . " the government " may or may not gain greater public backing but the arab country is no better off today , nor is its future more promising with the elimination of the man from tikrit , " sadam 's hometown . " with the precipitate and quasi-clandestine hanging of the tyrant , baghdad has not just lost an opportunity to show magnanimity that iraq desperately needs if it is to have the least chink of home .
it has also lost the chance to carry on judging saddam for his crimes against humanity and expose to iraqis the truth behind his appalling reign in all its gore . " " now what ? " the german weekly bild am sonntag was similarly pessimistic , saying this was not a time for " joy or relief ... because saddam 's death does not solve any of the problems that the military campaign against him created . " the french sunday paper le journal du dimanche asked on its front page " and now what ? " " the condemnation of saddam hussein does not change anything on the ground , " it added . on saturday , most european nations , though condemning the former dictator 's crimes and his reign of terror , stridently criticized his execution , calling capital punishment cruel and barbaric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis grieve beside the grave of the former iraqi president saddam hussein in ouja , 130 kilometers north of baghdad european union reaction focused on opposition to the use of capital punishment as a matter of principle .
article two of the eu 's charter of basic human rights says no one " must be condemned to death or executed . " france , a staunch opponent of the iraq invasion , reiterated its opposition to capital punishment and " calls like all its european partners for the universal abolition of the death penalty , " the foreign ministry said . germany also reaffirmed its opposition to capital punishment while acknowledging that " thousands of innocents were killed and tortured " under the saddam regime . " the german government , like the rest of the european union , rejects capital punishment as a matter of principle in all circumstances , " a foreign ministry statement said . britain , the main us ally in iraq , said saddam had been " held to account " but reiterated its opposition to the death penalty . a " missed opportunity " for iraq italian prime minister romano prodi said he was concerned over tensions fanned in iraq by the execution . " from the first hours -lrb- following saddam 's hanging -rrb- we 've seen that the consequences have been an increase in tensions and violence , as you could have predicted , " prodi was quoted by ansa news agency as saying .
" i hope it wo n't continue , " he added . prodi on friday issued a final plea against saddam 's execution , saying " no fault can determine one man to be the bearer of death to another . " a statement by terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , europe 's top human rights body , described the trial as a " missed opportunity in a country which does not have many opportunities . " it was an opportunity for iraq to join the civilized world .
the former iraqi dictator was a ruthless criminal who deserved to be punished , but it was wrong to kill him , " davis said . what iraqis need is " justice , reconciliation and peace , not hangings and revenge .

" but it conceded that the hanging " might sow a necessary seed of separation between " loyalists of the secular baath party that had ruled iraq for three decades and the islamist extremists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi state television broadcast graphic images of the execution " the execution has definitively robbed the former group of a symbolic figurehead and any hope of a recognizable baathist revival , " the right-leaning newspaper said in an editorial .
the dictator 's death " may yet open up a tiny chink of hope , " it concluded . the left-leaning independent on sunday said saddam 's execution defied moves worldwide in recent decades to scrap the death penalty and " can too easily be portrayed throughout the arab and muslim worlds as victor 's justice . " " this is not the beginning of a new iraq " the italian press also agreed that the execution had " divided the world " and would not " end the nightmare of the iraqis . " the business daily il sole 24 ore said " this is not the beginning of a new iraq , " while il messagero concluded that dialogue was urgently needed in iraq but " the necessary conditions to do not exist , and that death of saddam will not help this . " only the turin-based daily la stampa saw saddam 's death as " possibly a turning point for a country finally united by the disappearance of the person chiefly responsible for its ruin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iraqis were jubilant at news of the execution , but violence continued unabated spain 's respected daily el pais said that in executing saddam the iraqi government " lamentably succumbed to an easy temptation . " the government " may or may not gain greater public backing but the arab country is no better off today , nor is its future more promising with the elimination of the man from tikrit , " sadam 's hometown . " with the precipitate and quasi-clandestine hanging of the tyrant , baghdad has not just lost an opportunity to show magnanimity that iraq desperately needs if it is to have the least chink of home .
it has also lost the chance to carry on judging saddam for his crimes against humanity and expose to iraqis the truth behind his appalling reign in all its gore . " " now what ? " the german weekly bild am sonntag was similarly pessimistic , saying this was not a time for " joy or relief ... because saddam 's death does not solve any of the problems that the military campaign against him created . " the french sunday paper le journal du dimanche asked on its front page " and now what ? " " the condemnation of saddam hussein does not change anything on the ground , " it added . on saturday , most european nations , though condemning the former dictator 's crimes and his reign of terror , stridently criticized his execution , calling capital punishment cruel and barbaric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis grieve beside the grave of the former iraqi president saddam hussein in ouja , 130 kilometers north of baghdad european union reaction focused on opposition to the use of capital punishment as a matter of principle .
article two of the eu 's charter of basic human rights says no one " must be condemned to death or executed . " france , a staunch opponent of the iraq invasion , reiterated its opposition to capital punishment and " calls like all its european partners for the universal abolition of the death penalty , " the foreign ministry said . germany also reaffirmed its opposition to capital punishment while acknowledging that " thousands of innocents were killed and tortured " under the saddam regime . " the german government , like the rest of the european union , rejects capital punishment as a matter of principle in all circumstances , " a foreign ministry statement said . britain , the main us ally in iraq , said saddam had been " held to account " but reiterated its opposition to the death penalty . a " missed opportunity " for iraq italian prime minister romano prodi said he was concerned over tensions fanned in iraq by the execution . " from the first hours -lrb- following saddam 's hanging -rrb- we 've seen that the consequences have been an increase in tensions and violence , as you could have predicted , " prodi was quoted by ansa news agency as saying .
" i hope it wo n't continue , " he added . prodi on friday issued a final plea against saddam 's execution , saying " no fault can determine one man to be the bearer of death to another . " a statement by terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , europe 's top human rights body , described the trial as a " missed opportunity in a country which does not have many opportunities . " it was an opportunity for iraq to join the civilized world .
the former iraqi dictator was a ruthless criminal who deserved to be punished , but it was wrong to kill him , " davis said . what iraqis need is " justice , reconciliation and peace , not hangings and revenge .

besides , eu headquarters in brussels will be keeping a close eye on whether the two nations abide by their pledges to crack down on corruption and organized crime . meanwhile , in a clearer success story , all is ready for eu member slovenia to become on january 1 the first former communist state to adopt the union 's common currency , the euro , officials said in ljubljana . big new year 's bash in romania , bulgaria thousands of revelers were expected to flock to a gigantic rock and pop concert on alexander battenberg square in the bulgarian capital , sofia .
the show will be interrupted for speeches by president georgi parvanov , prime minister sergei stanichev and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
but the partying is expected to continue long into the night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a romanian worker checks the eu stars as the country perpares for eu celebrations a pyramid of light will illuminate the sky above sofia , its five rays emanating from the city 's orthodox cathedral , its armenian church , a synagogue , a church and a mosque . in bucharest , european parliament president josep borrel and other dignitaries including foreign ministers from germany , bulgaria , denmark and hungary are to meet with romanian president traian basescu and prime minister calin tariceanu for a countdown until midnight , and adhesion to the eu . the latest euro barometer poll published in december shows that at the eve of accession 63 percent of all bulgarians and 69 percent of all romanians think their eastern european states will largely benefit from eu membership .
this is above the european norm where the average approval of membership hovers around 54 percent . together with greece , the two newcomers will be the only balkan nations in europe 's rich club , and will play a key role as representatives of a region ravaged by the wars in the former yugoslavia . eu 's poorest members political analyst ivan krastev of the sofia-based centre for liberal strategies told afp that " with the accession of bulgaria and romania the region will receive a clear message that enlargement is not dead . " eu leaders agreed december 15 in brussels to put the lid on further enlargement of the bloc .
the decision has major repercussions for eu hopefuls in the balkans such as croatia , which is at the front of the queue and expected to join by 2010 . bulgaria and romania will be europe 's poorest members with gross domestic product per capita barely reaching one third of the european average , eurostat statistics show . the two will contribute only one percent to the eu 's gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian women from the mohammedan ethnic minority , also called pomaks the gap between bulgaria and romania and the current eu members has raised fears of a sharp rise in prices after january 1 in the newcomers where average monthly salaries are about 200 euros -lrb- $ 260 -rrb- . perhaps due to people fearing instant inflation , bulgaria this month saw a 30 percent rise in purchases compared to the usual end of year holiday spending spree .
romanian hypermarkets also reported higher sales towards the end of the year with french carrefour posting a 45 percent rise in 2006 compared to 2005 . deep scrutiny by brussels bulgaria and romania will be subjected to unprecedented monitoring by brussels , due to lagging reforms . the fight against crime and rampant corruption , management of the european funds and food safety will be particularly placed under brussels ' magnifying glass .
bulgaria will also have to carry out reforms to make its judiciary more efficient , with several notorious criminals managing to avoid imprisonment . if progress is slow , the enthusiasm of the two newcomers risks being clouded by restrictions , including partial suspension of agricultural subsidies and non-recognition of the decisions of their courts in europe . another problem is allowing borders to fall totally . fearing a flood of cheap labor , spain , britain , denmark , hungary , ireland , france and greece have announced restrictions on workers from the two incoming states . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bulgaria in nuclear quandary as eu entry nears as a precondition for joining the eu , bulgaria pledged to shut off two working nuclear reactors by jan .

now , its makers are hoping for a comeback . once referred to as the ferrari of the east , the low-slung , wing-doored melkus rs 1000 sports car was a proud and popular speedster during the communist era . not that there were many of them available .
only 101 of the sleek , drop-nosed racers were made between 1969 and 1979 -lrb- today just 80 of them are in shape to be driven -rrb- .
after 1979 , the family firm was forced to halt production due to a plunge in the east 's economy . built from old parts the car was the brainchild of heinz melkus , a city driving school operator and himself a fanatic sports car enthusiast in the 1960s and 70s .
the original rs 1000 cars were sleek in appearance , and might have been plucked out of a james bond movie - had their performance matched their looks . molded out of fiberglass , and assembled from parts of the famous put-putting east german trabant , they were dependent on the 75 horse power , two stroke engines taken from the ir wartburg 353 sedan .
they could reach a top speed of 102 miles per hour . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter melkus , the son of original designer hanz , has brought the car back east german sports car enthusiasts loved the melkus rs1000 , and mourned its passing .
now , 27 years after communist east germany 's only sports car went out of production , it is aiming for a comeback . unveiling in dresden currently , a five-man-strong dresden firm headed by peter melkus , the son of heinz who died aged 78 last year , is involved in a relaunch of the car . " we plan to complete 15 of the melkus rs 1000s , costing 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 66,238 -rrb- , by the end of 2007 , " explained peter melkus , the son of heinz , who died last year at age 78 .
" a dozen of them have already found owners . " heinz melkus ' 23-year-old grandson , sepp , told german news agency dpa that the first of the revamped sports cars based on the original was recently unveiled at the dresden transport museum . " owners of several of the original rs 100s showed up for the occasion in their vehicles , which added to the atmosphere , " said sepp . only 101 ever made according to sepp , his grandfather built the first sports cars in the 1960s after he was overtaken on the highway in 1969 by a sleek looking lotus , on a drive to yugoslavia . although individual private enterprise was n't allowed in the communist state as such , east germany was gearing up to celebrate its 20th anniversary at the time and the authorities surprisingly agreed . all told , 101 of the melkus rs 100s were made between 1969 to 1979 by heinz melkus and a handful of assistants who worked out of a garage near his dresden home .
they were built from segments of trabants and wartburgs , secured from factories and junkyards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rs 1000 is built from the trabent , which has an even broader cult following at the same time , hans melkus gained growing recognition throughout eastern europe as a racing driver .
east germany 's equivalent of michael schumacher , he won 80 grand prix events and at the height of his fame was the holder of the peace and friendship cup , the state 's top motor-racing trophy . plans for new version but melkus 's grandson said the 15 melkus rs 1000s will be the last of their kind to be made by the dresden company . " once we have completed our remake of the original , we have plans to embark on the next generation - the melkus rs 2000 , " he said .
the cars are expected to sell for 70,000 euros . during its 40-year history , the east germany was hardly a car owners ' paradise .
citizens had to wait up to 10 years before obtaining the two-stroke , smoke-puffing trabant - popularly known as " trabi " - and up to 15 years for the boxy wartburg sedan . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trabis enjoy cult status in former east germany nearly 50 years after the first model rolled off the production lines , the car that became a symbol of east germany can still be seen pottering along german roads .

besides , eu headquarters in brussels will be keeping a close eye on whether the two nations abide by their pledges to crack down on corruption and organized crime . meanwhile , in a clearer success story , all is ready for eu member slovenia to become on january 1 the first former communist state to adopt the union 's common currency , the euro , officials said in ljubljana . big new year 's bash in romania , bulgaria thousands of revelers were expected to flock to a gigantic rock and pop concert on alexander battenberg square in the bulgarian capital , sofia .
the show will be interrupted for speeches by president georgi parvanov , prime minister sergei stanichev and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
but the partying is expected to continue long into the night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a romanian worker checks the eu stars as the country perpares for eu celebrations a pyramid of light will illuminate the sky above sofia , its five rays emanating from the city 's orthodox cathedral , its armenian church , a synagogue , a church and a mosque . in bucharest , european parliament president josep borrel and other dignitaries including foreign ministers from germany , bulgaria , denmark and hungary are to meet with romanian president traian basescu and prime minister calin tariceanu for a countdown until midnight , and adhesion to the eu . the latest euro barometer poll published in december shows that at the eve of accession 63 percent of all bulgarians and 69 percent of all romanians think their eastern european states will largely benefit from eu membership .
this is above the european norm where the average approval of membership hovers around 54 percent . together with greece , the two newcomers will be the only balkan nations in europe 's rich club , and will play a key role as representatives of a region ravaged by the wars in the former yugoslavia . eu 's poorest members political analyst ivan krastev of the sofia-based centre for liberal strategies told afp that " with the accession of bulgaria and romania the region will receive a clear message that enlargement is not dead . " eu leaders agreed december 15 in brussels to put the lid on further enlargement of the bloc .
the decision has major repercussions for eu hopefuls in the balkans such as croatia , which is at the front of the queue and expected to join by 2010 . bulgaria and romania will be europe 's poorest members with gross domestic product per capita barely reaching one third of the european average , eurostat statistics show . the two will contribute only one percent to the eu 's gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian women from the mohammedan ethnic minority , also called pomaks the gap between bulgaria and romania and the current eu members has raised fears of a sharp rise in prices after january 1 in the newcomers where average monthly salaries are about 200 euros -lrb- $ 260 -rrb- . perhaps due to people fearing instant inflation , bulgaria this month saw a 30 percent rise in purchases compared to the usual end of year holiday spending spree .
romanian hypermarkets also reported higher sales towards the end of the year with french carrefour posting a 45 percent rise in 2006 compared to 2005 . deep scrutiny by brussels bulgaria and romania will be subjected to unprecedented monitoring by brussels , due to lagging reforms . the fight against crime and rampant corruption , management of the european funds and food safety will be particularly placed under brussels ' magnifying glass .
bulgaria will also have to carry out reforms to make its judiciary more efficient , with several notorious criminals managing to avoid imprisonment . if progress is slow , the enthusiasm of the two newcomers risks being clouded by restrictions , including partial suspension of agricultural subsidies and non-recognition of the decisions of their courts in europe . another problem is allowing borders to fall totally . fearing a flood of cheap labor , spain , britain , denmark , hungary , ireland , france and greece have announced restrictions on workers from the two incoming states . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bulgaria in nuclear quandary as eu entry nears as a precondition for joining the eu , bulgaria pledged to shut off two working nuclear reactors by jan .

but the country is dragging its heels – with reason , some say .
-lrb- 28.12.2006 -rrb- will eu entry shrink bulgaria 's population even more ?
bulgarian towns are shrinking , and the birth rate is falling rapidly .
now bulgarians are worried that even more of their young people will leave after the country joins the eu on jan 1 .

" the 15-minute sketch , acted by freddie frinton and may warden , will also be televised by every other major regional public-tv channel in germany and by a scattering of commercial networks . the black-and-white british slapstick sketch , totally unknown in the english-speaking world , has become the highest-rated tv show in german history , and has spawned fan clubs and a cult following of viewers who stage parties to recreate the sketch at home . in a nation not exactly known for its ribaldry and thigh-slapping humor , the new year 's eve showing of " dinner for one " never fails to bring down the house .
there are viewers who have memorized every gesture , every line of the english-only sketch . same procedure … the mere mention of the tag-line , " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " will break the ice with the sternest of stern-faced germans .
mention that line , regardless of the situation , and be prepared for the german to reply with , " same procedure as every year , james , " and then collapse into hysterical laughter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks are an annual german tradition it is a phenomenon that has become ritualized into tradition .
" the dinner for one " sketch was originally performed in the 1920s in british music halls . in the early 1960s , a german television producer had caught the stage act in blackpool and invited frinton to fly back to hamburg with him to tape the sketch for a one-time broadcast in 1963 . studio employees and in-house secretaries served as the live audience for the sketch about a butler who gets riotously drunk while serving food and drinks to his employer , miss sophie , and her guests on her 90th birthday . the running joke is that she sits alone at the table because she has outlived all her male guests who were her former lovers .
butler james assumes the role of each ' guest ' in order to toast miss sophie with champagne , wine , port and so on throughout the meal .
before each toast , he asks plaintively : " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " to which she responds , " the same procedure as every year , james . " the " same procedure " line is repeated one final time after dinner as butler james escorts miss sophie upstairs to bed , with frinton leering knowingly at the audience and affirming , " i 'll do me very best ! " the highest ratings the sketch was used as a new year 's eve filler on ndr television in hamburg in the early 1970s and it quickly became a regular part of german new year 's eve celebrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : butler james has wowed german viewers since 1963 over the years somehow , it has become a cult classic in germany - to the extent that it is shown on dozens of regional channels at some point over new year and ndr shows it six or seven times during new year 's eve . " it usually has the highest rating of any program shown during the year , " says jürgen meier-beer , ndr 's head of entertainment .
" we have an average market share in our area of 8 percent .
' dinner for one ' gets us up to 20 to 30 percent every time .
we reckon that one in every two viewers in our area will watch it at some point on new year 's eve . " in recent years , it has also been shown in austria , switzerland , denmark and other countries . ironically , frinton died long before his sketch made him a household name across central europe . getting in on the joke many germans are shocked to learn that the rest of the world is ignorant of this pearl of british humor . english-speaking visitors to germany are invariably flummoxed by continual references to this obscure sketch .
in a bid to make casual conversation , a german might ask , " what do you think of ' dinner for one ' ? " " ' dinner for one ' what , " is often the reply . " you know - ' dinner for one ' - ' james , miss sophie , same procedure as every year ? " '
and then they break into an uncontrolled fit of giggles . a silly moment of merriment also , germans are amazed that few people in britain under the age of 50 know who frinton was .
in fact , frinton was a master at playing comic drunks and had a huge following on british television in the 1950s . he was a bit past his prime when he taped the german version of his popular sketch .
viewed for the first time , the sketch seems dated and stale , an impression not helped by the fact that it was shot in black and white , and recorded on videotape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate hosts a showy new year 's party but what germans love about " dinner for one " is the fact that it is a silly moment of merriment that has become enshrined in the nation 's psyche .
people remember seeing it when they were young and with people who are no longer present , and they remember new year 's eves gone by . the sketch , of course , improves from repeated viewing , not unlike the rocky horror picture show .
and on new year 's eve , of course , many viewers have been raising their glasses in toasts all evening already and are as smashed as frinton 's character in the sketch .
that makes it easy for millions to slur the lines right along with the inebriated butler . never shown in britain what many people in germany do n't realize is that the sketch has never been shown in either britain or the us , though it has had a few showings on australian cable tv . but then , there are those german-language figures who are unknown in germany .
when a german asks what you think of " dinner for one , " one can respond by asking what they think of " the sound of music . " then the shoe will be on the other foot .
one can even launch into a rendition of the song , " edelweiss . "

" the 15-minute sketch , acted by freddie frinton and may warden , will also be televised by every other major regional public-tv channel in germany and by a scattering of commercial networks . the black-and-white british slapstick sketch , totally unknown in the english-speaking world , has become the highest-rated tv show in german history , and has spawned fan clubs and a cult following of viewers who stage parties to recreate the sketch at home . in a nation not exactly known for its ribaldry and thigh-slapping humor , the new year 's eve showing of " dinner for one " never fails to bring down the house .
there are viewers who have memorized every gesture , every line of the english-only sketch . same procedure … the mere mention of the tag-line , " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " will break the ice with the sternest of stern-faced germans .
mention that line , regardless of the situation , and be prepared for the german to reply with , " same procedure as every year , james , " and then collapse into hysterical laughter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks are an annual german tradition it is a phenomenon that has become ritualized into tradition .
" the dinner for one " sketch was originally performed in the 1920s in british music halls . in the early 1960s , a german television producer had caught the stage act in blackpool and invited frinton to fly back to hamburg with him to tape the sketch for a one-time broadcast in 1963 . studio employees and in-house secretaries served as the live audience for the sketch about a butler who gets riotously drunk while serving food and drinks to his employer , miss sophie , and her guests on her 90th birthday . the running joke is that she sits alone at the table because she has outlived all her male guests who were her former lovers .
butler james assumes the role of each ' guest ' in order to toast miss sophie with champagne , wine , port and so on throughout the meal .
before each toast , he asks plaintively : " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " to which she responds , " the same procedure as every year , james . " the " same procedure " line is repeated one final time after dinner as butler james escorts miss sophie upstairs to bed , with frinton leering knowingly at the audience and affirming , " i 'll do me very best ! " the highest ratings the sketch was used as a new year 's eve filler on ndr television in hamburg in the early 1970s and it quickly became a regular part of german new year 's eve celebrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : butler james has wowed german viewers since 1963 over the years somehow , it has become a cult classic in germany - to the extent that it is shown on dozens of regional channels at some point over new year and ndr shows it six or seven times during new year 's eve . " it usually has the highest rating of any program shown during the year , " says jürgen meier-beer , ndr 's head of entertainment .
" we have an average market share in our area of 8 percent .
' dinner for one ' gets us up to 20 to 30 percent every time .
we reckon that one in every two viewers in our area will watch it at some point on new year 's eve . " in recent years , it has also been shown in austria , switzerland , denmark and other countries . ironically , frinton died long before his sketch made him a household name across central europe . getting in on the joke many germans are shocked to learn that the rest of the world is ignorant of this pearl of british humor . english-speaking visitors to germany are invariably flummoxed by continual references to this obscure sketch .
in a bid to make casual conversation , a german might ask , " what do you think of ' dinner for one ' ? " " ' dinner for one ' what , " is often the reply . " you know - ' dinner for one ' - ' james , miss sophie , same procedure as every year ? " '
and then they break into an uncontrolled fit of giggles . a silly moment of merriment also , germans are amazed that few people in britain under the age of 50 know who frinton was .
in fact , frinton was a master at playing comic drunks and had a huge following on british television in the 1950s . he was a bit past his prime when he taped the german version of his popular sketch .
viewed for the first time , the sketch seems dated and stale , an impression not helped by the fact that it was shot in black and white , and recorded on videotape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate hosts a showy new year 's party but what germans love about " dinner for one " is the fact that it is a silly moment of merriment that has become enshrined in the nation 's psyche .
people remember seeing it when they were young and with people who are no longer present , and they remember new year 's eves gone by . the sketch , of course , improves from repeated viewing , not unlike the rocky horror picture show .
and on new year 's eve , of course , many viewers have been raising their glasses in toasts all evening already and are as smashed as frinton 's character in the sketch .
that makes it easy for millions to slur the lines right along with the inebriated butler . never shown in britain what many people in germany do n't realize is that the sketch has never been shown in either britain or the us , though it has had a few showings on australian cable tv . but then , there are those german-language figures who are unknown in germany .
when a german asks what you think of " dinner for one , " one can respond by asking what they think of " the sound of music . " then the shoe will be on the other foot .

" the 15-minute sketch , acted by freddie frinton and may warden , will also be televised by every other major regional public-tv channel in germany and by a scattering of commercial networks . the black-and-white british slapstick sketch , totally unknown in the english-speaking world , has become the highest-rated tv show in german history , and has spawned fan clubs and a cult following of viewers who stage parties to recreate the sketch at home . in a nation not exactly known for its ribaldry and thigh-slapping humor , the new year 's eve showing of " dinner for one " never fails to bring down the house .
there are viewers who have memorized every gesture , every line of the english-only sketch . same procedure … the mere mention of the tag-line , " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " will break the ice with the sternest of stern-faced germans .
mention that line , regardless of the situation , and be prepared for the german to reply with , " same procedure as every year , james , " and then collapse into hysterical laughter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks are an annual german tradition it is a phenomenon that has become ritualized into tradition .
" the dinner for one " sketch was originally performed in the 1920s in british music halls . in the early 1960s , a german television producer had caught the stage act in blackpool and invited frinton to fly back to hamburg with him to tape the sketch for a one-time broadcast in 1963 . studio employees and in-house secretaries served as the live audience for the sketch about a butler who gets riotously drunk while serving food and drinks to his employer , miss sophie , and her guests on her 90th birthday . the running joke is that she sits alone at the table because she has outlived all her male guests who were her former lovers .
butler james assumes the role of each ' guest ' in order to toast miss sophie with champagne , wine , port and so on throughout the meal .
before each toast , he asks plaintively : " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " to which she responds , " the same procedure as every year , james . " the " same procedure " line is repeated one final time after dinner as butler james escorts miss sophie upstairs to bed , with frinton leering knowingly at the audience and affirming , " i 'll do me very best ! " the highest ratings the sketch was used as a new year 's eve filler on ndr television in hamburg in the early 1970s and it quickly became a regular part of german new year 's eve celebrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : butler james has wowed german viewers since 1963 over the years somehow , it has become a cult classic in germany - to the extent that it is shown on dozens of regional channels at some point over new year and ndr shows it six or seven times during new year 's eve . " it usually has the highest rating of any program shown during the year , " says jürgen meier-beer , ndr 's head of entertainment .
" we have an average market share in our area of 8 percent .
' dinner for one ' gets us up to 20 to 30 percent every time .
we reckon that one in every two viewers in our area will watch it at some point on new year 's eve . " in recent years , it has also been shown in austria , switzerland , denmark and other countries . ironically , frinton died long before his sketch made him a household name across central europe . getting in on the joke many germans are shocked to learn that the rest of the world is ignorant of this pearl of british humor . english-speaking visitors to germany are invariably flummoxed by continual references to this obscure sketch .
in a bid to make casual conversation , a german might ask , " what do you think of ' dinner for one ' ? " " ' dinner for one ' what , " is often the reply . " you know - ' dinner for one ' - ' james , miss sophie , same procedure as every year ? " '
and then they break into an uncontrolled fit of giggles . a silly moment of merriment also , germans are amazed that few people in britain under the age of 50 know who frinton was .
in fact , frinton was a master at playing comic drunks and had a huge following on british television in the 1950s . he was a bit past his prime when he taped the german version of his popular sketch .
viewed for the first time , the sketch seems dated and stale , an impression not helped by the fact that it was shot in black and white , and recorded on videotape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate hosts a showy new year 's party but what germans love about " dinner for one " is the fact that it is a silly moment of merriment that has become enshrined in the nation 's psyche .
people remember seeing it when they were young and with people who are no longer present , and they remember new year 's eves gone by . the sketch , of course , improves from repeated viewing , not unlike the rocky horror picture show .
and on new year 's eve , of course , many viewers have been raising their glasses in toasts all evening already and are as smashed as frinton 's character in the sketch .
that makes it easy for millions to slur the lines right along with the inebriated butler . never shown in britain what many people in germany do n't realize is that the sketch has never been shown in either britain or the us , though it has had a few showings on australian cable tv . but then , there are those german-language figures who are unknown in germany .
when a german asks what you think of " dinner for one , " one can respond by asking what they think of " the sound of music . " then the shoe will be on the other foot .
one can even launch into a rendition of the song , " edelweiss . "

" a statement by terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , europe 's top human rights body , described the trial as a " missed opportunity in a country which does not have many opportunities . " it was an opportunity for iraq to join the civilized world .

other aims , she said , would include streamlining the government budget , investing in education and research , improving energy efficiency and fighting climate change . referring to germany taking on both the eu and g8 presidencies on jan 1 , 2007 , merkel said that europe would work if every nation did their homework well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 31.12.2006 europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein 's execution was the focus of newspapers across the world as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems . newspapers in europe , which on sunday caught up with broadcasters and the internet in focusing on former iraqi dictator saddam hussein 's execution for crimes against humanity , were largely in agreement that the hanging would do little to change things on the ground in iraq . the sunday telegraph in london said it would be " naive to think that his -lrb- saddam hussein 's -rrb- execution will end the growing sectarian violence that has gripped iraq since the us-led invasion toppled saddam in march 2003 . " but it conceded that the hanging " might sow a necessary seed of separation between " loyalists of the secular baath party that had ruled iraq for three decades and the islamist extremists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi state television broadcast graphic images of the execution " the execution has definitively robbed the former group of a symbolic figurehead and any hope of a recognizable baathist revival , " the right-leaning newspaper said in an editorial .
the dictator 's death " may yet open up a tiny chink of hope , " it concluded . the left-leaning independent on sunday said saddam 's execution defied moves worldwide in recent decades to scrap the death penalty and " can too easily be portrayed throughout the arab and muslim worlds as victor 's justice . " " this is not the beginning of a new iraq " the italian press also agreed that the execution had " divided the world " and would not " end the nightmare of the iraqis . " the business daily il sole 24 ore said " this is not the beginning of a new iraq , " while il messagero concluded that dialogue was urgently needed in iraq but " the necessary conditions to do not exist , and that death of saddam will not help this . " only the turin-based daily la stampa saw saddam 's death as " possibly a turning point for a country finally united by the disappearance of the person chiefly responsible for its ruin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iraqis were jubilant at news of the execution , but violence continued unabated spain 's respected daily el pais said that in executing saddam the iraqi government " lamentably succumbed to an easy temptation . " the government " may or may not gain greater public backing but the arab country is no better off today , nor is its future more promising with the elimination of the man from tikrit , " sadam 's hometown . " with the precipitate and quasi-clandestine hanging of the tyrant , baghdad has not just lost an opportunity to show magnanimity that iraq desperately needs if it is to have the least chink of home .
it has also lost the chance to carry on judging saddam for his crimes against humanity and expose to iraqis the truth behind his appalling reign in all its gore . " " now what ? " the german weekly bild am sonntag was similarly pessimistic , saying this was not a time for " joy or relief ... because saddam 's death does not solve any of the problems that the military campaign against him created . " the french sunday paper le journal du dimanche asked on its front page " and now what ? " " the condemnation of saddam hussein does not change anything on the ground , " it added . on saturday , most european nations , though condemning the former dictator 's crimes and his reign of terror , stridently criticized his execution , calling capital punishment cruel and barbaric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis grieve beside the grave of the former iraqi president saddam hussein in ouja , 130 kilometers north of baghdad european union reaction focused on opposition to the use of capital punishment as a matter of principle .
article two of the eu 's charter of basic human rights says no one " must be condemned to death or executed . " france , a staunch opponent of the iraq invasion , reiterated its opposition to capital punishment and " calls like all its european partners for the universal abolition of the death penalty , " the foreign ministry said . germany also reaffirmed its opposition to capital punishment while acknowledging that " thousands of innocents were killed and tortured " under the saddam regime . " the german government , like the rest of the european union , rejects capital punishment as a matter of principle in all circumstances , " a foreign ministry statement said . britain , the main us ally in iraq , said saddam had been " held to account " but reiterated its opposition to the death penalty . a " missed opportunity " for iraq italian prime minister romano prodi said he was concerned over tensions fanned in iraq by the execution . " from the first hours -lrb- following saddam 's hanging -rrb- we 've seen that the consequences have been an increase in tensions and violence , as you could have predicted , " prodi was quoted by ansa news agency as saying .
" i hope it wo n't continue , " he added . prodi on friday issued a final plea against saddam 's execution , saying " no fault can determine one man to be the bearer of death to another . " a statement by terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , europe 's top human rights body , described the trial as a " missed opportunity in a country which does not have many opportunities . " it was an opportunity for iraq to join the civilized world .
the former iraqi dictator was a ruthless criminal who deserved to be punished , but it was wrong to kill him , " davis said . what iraqis need is " justice , reconciliation and peace , not hangings and revenge .

" but it conceded that the hanging " might sow a necessary seed of separation between " loyalists of the secular baath party that had ruled iraq for three decades and the islamist extremists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi state television broadcast graphic images of the execution " the execution has definitively robbed the former group of a symbolic figurehead and any hope of a recognizable baathist revival , " the right-leaning newspaper said in an editorial .
the dictator 's death " may yet open up a tiny chink of hope , " it concluded . the left-leaning independent on sunday said saddam 's execution defied moves worldwide in recent decades to scrap the death penalty and " can too easily be portrayed throughout the arab and muslim worlds as victor 's justice . " " this is not the beginning of a new iraq " the italian press also agreed that the execution had " divided the world " and would not " end the nightmare of the iraqis . " the business daily il sole 24 ore said " this is not the beginning of a new iraq , " while il messagero concluded that dialogue was urgently needed in iraq but " the necessary conditions to do not exist , and that death of saddam will not help this . " only the turin-based daily la stampa saw saddam 's death as " possibly a turning point for a country finally united by the disappearance of the person chiefly responsible for its ruin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iraqis were jubilant at news of the execution , but violence continued unabated spain 's respected daily el pais said that in executing saddam the iraqi government " lamentably succumbed to an easy temptation . " the government " may or may not gain greater public backing but the arab country is no better off today , nor is its future more promising with the elimination of the man from tikrit , " sadam 's hometown . " with the precipitate and quasi-clandestine hanging of the tyrant , baghdad has not just lost an opportunity to show magnanimity that iraq desperately needs if it is to have the least chink of home .
it has also lost the chance to carry on judging saddam for his crimes against humanity and expose to iraqis the truth behind his appalling reign in all its gore . " " now what ? " the german weekly bild am sonntag was similarly pessimistic , saying this was not a time for " joy or relief ... because saddam 's death does not solve any of the problems that the military campaign against him created . " the french sunday paper le journal du dimanche asked on its front page " and now what ? " " the condemnation of saddam hussein does not change anything on the ground , " it added . on saturday , most european nations , though condemning the former dictator 's crimes and his reign of terror , stridently criticized his execution , calling capital punishment cruel and barbaric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis grieve beside the grave of the former iraqi president saddam hussein in ouja , 130 kilometers north of baghdad european union reaction focused on opposition to the use of capital punishment as a matter of principle .
article two of the eu 's charter of basic human rights says no one " must be condemned to death or executed . " france , a staunch opponent of the iraq invasion , reiterated its opposition to capital punishment and " calls like all its european partners for the universal abolition of the death penalty , " the foreign ministry said . germany also reaffirmed its opposition to capital punishment while acknowledging that " thousands of innocents were killed and tortured " under the saddam regime . " the german government , like the rest of the european union , rejects capital punishment as a matter of principle in all circumstances , " a foreign ministry statement said . britain , the main us ally in iraq , said saddam had been " held to account " but reiterated its opposition to the death penalty . a " missed opportunity " for iraq italian prime minister romano prodi said he was concerned over tensions fanned in iraq by the execution . " from the first hours -lrb- following saddam 's hanging -rrb- we 've seen that the consequences have been an increase in tensions and violence , as you could have predicted , " prodi was quoted by ansa news agency as saying .
" i hope it wo n't continue , " he added . prodi on friday issued a final plea against saddam 's execution , saying " no fault can determine one man to be the bearer of death to another . " a statement by terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , europe 's top human rights body , described the trial as a " missed opportunity in a country which does not have many opportunities . " it was an opportunity for iraq to join the civilized world .
the former iraqi dictator was a ruthless criminal who deserved to be punished , but it was wrong to kill him , " davis said . what iraqis need is " justice , reconciliation and peace , not hangings and revenge .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 31.12.2006 europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein 's execution was the focus of newspapers across the world as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems . newspapers in europe , which on sunday caught up with broadcasters and the internet in focusing on former iraqi dictator saddam hussein 's execution for crimes against humanity , were largely in agreement that the hanging would do little to change things on the ground in iraq . the sunday telegraph in london said it would be " naive to think that his -lrb- saddam hussein 's -rrb- execution will end the growing sectarian violence that has gripped iraq since the us-led invasion toppled saddam in march 2003 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 31.12.2006 europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein 's execution was the focus of newspapers across the world as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems . newspapers in europe , which on sunday caught up with broadcasters and the internet in focusing on former iraqi dictator saddam hussein 's execution for crimes against humanity , were largely in agreement that the hanging would do little to change things on the ground in iraq . the sunday telegraph in london said it would be " naive to think that his -lrb- saddam hussein 's -rrb- execution will end the growing sectarian violence that has gripped iraq since the us-led invasion toppled saddam in march 2003 . " but it conceded that the hanging " might sow a necessary seed of separation between " loyalists of the secular baath party that had ruled iraq for three decades and the islamist extremists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi state television broadcast graphic images of the execution " the execution has definitively robbed the former group of a symbolic figurehead and any hope of a recognizable baathist revival , " the right-leaning newspaper said in an editorial .
the dictator 's death " may yet open up a tiny chink of hope , " it concluded . the left-leaning independent on sunday said saddam 's execution defied moves worldwide in recent decades to scrap the death penalty and " can too easily be portrayed throughout the arab and muslim worlds as victor 's justice . " " this is not the beginning of a new iraq " the italian press also agreed that the execution had " divided the world " and would not " end the nightmare of the iraqis . " the business daily il sole 24 ore said " this is not the beginning of a new iraq , " while il messagero concluded that dialogue was urgently needed in iraq but " the necessary conditions to do not exist , and that death of saddam will not help this . " only the turin-based daily la stampa saw saddam 's death as " possibly a turning point for a country finally united by the disappearance of the person chiefly responsible for its ruin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iraqis were jubilant at news of the execution , but violence continued unabated spain 's respected daily el pais said that in executing saddam the iraqi government " lamentably succumbed to an easy temptation . " the government " may or may not gain greater public backing but the arab country is no better off today , nor is its future more promising with the elimination of the man from tikrit , " sadam 's hometown . " with the precipitate and quasi-clandestine hanging of the tyrant , baghdad has not just lost an opportunity to show magnanimity that iraq desperately needs if it is to have the least chink of home .
it has also lost the chance to carry on judging saddam for his crimes against humanity and expose to iraqis the truth behind his appalling reign in all its gore . " " now what ? " the german weekly bild am sonntag was similarly pessimistic , saying this was not a time for " joy or relief ... because saddam 's death does not solve any of the problems that the military campaign against him created . " the french sunday paper le journal du dimanche asked on its front page " and now what ? " " the condemnation of saddam hussein does not change anything on the ground , " it added . on saturday , most european nations , though condemning the former dictator 's crimes and his reign of terror , stridently criticized his execution , calling capital punishment cruel and barbaric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis grieve beside the grave of the former iraqi president saddam hussein in ouja , 130 kilometers north of baghdad european union reaction focused on opposition to the use of capital punishment as a matter of principle .
article two of the eu 's charter of basic human rights says no one " must be condemned to death or executed . " france , a staunch opponent of the iraq invasion , reiterated its opposition to capital punishment and " calls like all its european partners for the universal abolition of the death penalty , " the foreign ministry said . germany also reaffirmed its opposition to capital punishment while acknowledging that " thousands of innocents were killed and tortured " under the saddam regime . " the german government , like the rest of the european union , rejects capital punishment as a matter of principle in all circumstances , " a foreign ministry statement said . britain , the main us ally in iraq , said saddam had been " held to account " but reiterated its opposition to the death penalty . a " missed opportunity " for iraq italian prime minister romano prodi said he was concerned over tensions fanned in iraq by the execution . " from the first hours -lrb- following saddam 's hanging -rrb- we 've seen that the consequences have been an increase in tensions and violence , as you could have predicted , " prodi was quoted by ansa news agency as saying .
" i hope it wo n't continue , " he added . prodi on friday issued a final plea against saddam 's execution , saying " no fault can determine one man to be the bearer of death to another . " a statement by terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , europe 's top human rights body , described the trial as a " missed opportunity in a country which does not have many opportunities . " it was an opportunity for iraq to join the civilized world .
the former iraqi dictator was a ruthless criminal who deserved to be punished , but it was wrong to kill him , " davis said . what iraqis need is " justice , reconciliation and peace , not hangings and revenge .

" that can only give us more encouragement , " merkel said . cutting unemployment will be priority in 2007 the chancellor 's speech also signals a rejection of calls by kurt beck , chairman of the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democrats , to slow down the pace of reform . this week , beck stirred debate by saying germans could not weather further reforms and that their endurance levels had been stretched to the maximum by painful social and economic reforms this year alone . however , merkel and her cdu colleagues as well as german president horst köhler , have strongly disputed beck 's comments , saying that structural reform was absolutely necessary if germany had to survive in the global marketplace and remain internationally competitive . merkel also underlined that her primary goal for 2007 would be to cut unemployment .
other aims , she said , would include streamlining the government budget , investing in education and research , improving energy efficiency and fighting climate change . referring to germany taking on both the eu and g8 presidencies on jan 1 , 2007 , merkel said that europe would work if every nation did their homework well .

besides , eu headquarters in brussels will be keeping a close eye on whether the two nations abide by their pledges to crack down on corruption and organized crime . meanwhile , in a clearer success story , all is ready for eu member slovenia to become on january 1 the first former communist state to adopt the union 's common currency , the euro , officials said in ljubljana . big new year 's bash in romania , bulgaria thousands of revelers were expected to flock to a gigantic rock and pop concert on alexander battenberg square in the bulgarian capital , sofia .
the show will be interrupted for speeches by president georgi parvanov , prime minister sergei stanichev and european commission president jose manuel barroso .
but the partying is expected to continue long into the night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a romanian worker checks the eu stars as the country perpares for eu celebrations a pyramid of light will illuminate the sky above sofia , its five rays emanating from the city 's orthodox cathedral , its armenian church , a synagogue , a church and a mosque . in bucharest , european parliament president josep borrel and other dignitaries including foreign ministers from germany , bulgaria , denmark and hungary are to meet with romanian president traian basescu and prime minister calin tariceanu for a countdown until midnight , and adhesion to the eu . the latest euro barometer poll published in december shows that at the eve of accession 63 percent of all bulgarians and 69 percent of all romanians think their eastern european states will largely benefit from eu membership .
this is above the european norm where the average approval of membership hovers around 54 percent . together with greece , the two newcomers will be the only balkan nations in europe 's rich club , and will play a key role as representatives of a region ravaged by the wars in the former yugoslavia . eu 's poorest members political analyst ivan krastev of the sofia-based centre for liberal strategies told afp that " with the accession of bulgaria and romania the region will receive a clear message that enlargement is not dead . " eu leaders agreed december 15 in brussels to put the lid on further enlargement of the bloc .

" if we were to be satisfied with the first success that we 've had , then the economic upturn would turn in to a flash in the pan just like so often in the past , " according to a transcript of merkel 's speech which will be broadcast on german television on sunday evening . the chancellor , leader of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she was aware of the painful impact of some of her government 's reform policies but stressed that the current economic upswing and the fall in the number of jobless in 2006 showed that the government was on the right track . " that can only give us more encouragement , " merkel said . cutting unemployment will be priority in 2007 the chancellor 's speech also signals a rejection of calls by kurt beck , chairman of the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democrats , to slow down the pace of reform . this week , beck stirred debate by saying germans could not weather further reforms and that their endurance levels had been stretched to the maximum by painful social and economic reforms this year alone . however , merkel and her cdu colleagues as well as german president horst köhler , have strongly disputed beck 's comments , saying that structural reform was absolutely necessary if germany had to survive in the global marketplace and remain internationally competitive . merkel also underlined that her primary goal for 2007 would be to cut unemployment .
other aims , she said , would include streamlining the government budget , investing in education and research , improving energy efficiency and fighting climate change . referring to germany taking on both the eu and g8 presidencies on jan 1 , 2007 , merkel said that europe would work if every nation did their homework well . " we 'll have to work twice as hard in 2007 - for progress in europe and for the continuation of the economic upturn in germany , " she said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrat leader warns against too many reforms the chairman of germany 's social democratic party , kurt beck , said that the painful social and economic reforms introduced by chancellor angela merkel had hurt germans badly and that people wouldn ’ t accept more .

" but it conceded that the hanging " might sow a necessary seed of separation between " loyalists of the secular baath party that had ruled iraq for three decades and the islamist extremists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi state television broadcast graphic images of the execution " the execution has definitively robbed the former group of a symbolic figurehead and any hope of a recognizable baathist revival , " the right-leaning newspaper said in an editorial .
the dictator 's death " may yet open up a tiny chink of hope , " it concluded . the left-leaning independent on sunday said saddam 's execution defied moves worldwide in recent decades to scrap the death penalty and " can too easily be portrayed throughout the arab and muslim worlds as victor 's justice . " " this is not the beginning of a new iraq " the italian press also agreed that the execution had " divided the world " and would not " end the nightmare of the iraqis . " the business daily il sole 24 ore said " this is not the beginning of a new iraq , " while il messagero concluded that dialogue was urgently needed in iraq but " the necessary conditions to do not exist , and that death of saddam will not help this . " only the turin-based daily la stampa saw saddam 's death as " possibly a turning point for a country finally united by the disappearance of the person chiefly responsible for its ruin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iraqis were jubilant at news of the execution , but violence continued unabated spain 's respected daily el pais said that in executing saddam the iraqi government " lamentably succumbed to an easy temptation . " the government " may or may not gain greater public backing but the arab country is no better off today , nor is its future more promising with the elimination of the man from tikrit , " sadam 's hometown . " with the precipitate and quasi-clandestine hanging of the tyrant , baghdad has not just lost an opportunity to show magnanimity that iraq desperately needs if it is to have the least chink of home .
it has also lost the chance to carry on judging saddam for his crimes against humanity and expose to iraqis the truth behind his appalling reign in all its gore . " " now what ? " the german weekly bild am sonntag was similarly pessimistic , saying this was not a time for " joy or relief ... because saddam 's death does not solve any of the problems that the military campaign against him created . " the french sunday paper le journal du dimanche asked on its front page " and now what ? " " the condemnation of saddam hussein does not change anything on the ground , " it added . on saturday , most european nations , though condemning the former dictator 's crimes and his reign of terror , stridently criticized his execution , calling capital punishment cruel and barbaric . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis grieve beside the grave of the former iraqi president saddam hussein in ouja , 130 kilometers north of baghdad european union reaction focused on opposition to the use of capital punishment as a matter of principle .
article two of the eu 's charter of basic human rights says no one " must be condemned to death or executed . " france , a staunch opponent of the iraq invasion , reiterated its opposition to capital punishment and " calls like all its european partners for the universal abolition of the death penalty , " the foreign ministry said . germany also reaffirmed its opposition to capital punishment while acknowledging that " thousands of innocents were killed and tortured " under the saddam regime . " the german government , like the rest of the european union , rejects capital punishment as a matter of principle in all circumstances , " a foreign ministry statement said . britain , the main us ally in iraq , said saddam had been " held to account " but reiterated its opposition to the death penalty . a " missed opportunity " for iraq italian prime minister romano prodi said he was concerned over tensions fanned in iraq by the execution . " from the first hours -lrb- following saddam 's hanging -rrb- we 've seen that the consequences have been an increase in tensions and violence , as you could have predicted , " prodi was quoted by ansa news agency as saying .
" i hope it wo n't continue , " he added . prodi on friday issued a final plea against saddam 's execution , saying " no fault can determine one man to be the bearer of death to another . " a statement by terry davis , secretary general of the council of europe , europe 's top human rights body , described the trial as a " missed opportunity in a country which does not have many opportunities . " it was an opportunity for iraq to join the civilized world .
the former iraqi dictator was a ruthless criminal who deserved to be punished , but it was wrong to kill him , " davis said . what iraqis need is " justice , reconciliation and peace , not hangings and revenge .

now , its makers are hoping for a comeback . once referred to as the ferrari of the east , the low-slung , wing-doored melkus rs 1000 sports car was a proud and popular speedster during the communist era . not that there were many of them available .
only 101 of the sleek , drop-nosed racers were made between 1969 and 1979 -lrb- today just 80 of them are in shape to be driven -rrb- .
after 1979 , the family firm was forced to halt production due to a plunge in the east 's economy . built from old parts the car was the brainchild of heinz melkus , a city driving school operator and himself a fanatic sports car enthusiast in the 1960s and 70s .
the original rs 1000 cars were sleek in appearance , and might have been plucked out of a james bond movie - had their performance matched their looks . molded out of fiberglass , and assembled from parts of the famous put-putting east german trabant , they were dependent on the 75 horse power , two stroke engines taken from the ir wartburg 353 sedan .

" a dozen of them have already found owners . " heinz melkus ' 23-year-old grandson , sepp , told german news agency dpa that the first of the revamped sports cars based on the original was recently unveiled at the dresden transport museum . " owners of several of the original rs 100s showed up for the occasion in their vehicles , which added to the atmosphere , " said sepp . only 101 ever made according to sepp , his grandfather built the first sports cars in the 1960s after he was overtaken on the highway in 1969 by a sleek looking lotus , on a drive to yugoslavia . although individual private enterprise was n't allowed in the communist state as such , east germany was gearing up to celebrate its 20th anniversary at the time and the authorities surprisingly agreed . all told , 101 of the melkus rs 100s were made between 1969 to 1979 by heinz melkus and a handful of assistants who worked out of a garage near his dresden home .
they were built from segments of trabants and wartburgs , secured from factories and junkyards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rs 1000 is built from the trabent , which has an even broader cult following at the same time , hans melkus gained growing recognition throughout eastern europe as a racing driver .

" once we have completed our remake of the original , we have plans to embark on the next generation - the melkus rs 2000 , " he said .
the cars are expected to sell for 70,000 euros . during its 40-year history , the east germany was hardly a car owners ' paradise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.12.2006 dinner for one : a german new year 's eve ritual großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miss sophie and butler , james have been regaling german audiences for years a classic tv sketch of a senile british woman and her drunk butler at her 90th birthday party thrills millions of germans every new year 's eve . millions of germans and other continental europeans will settle down in front of their tv sets on new year 's eve for what has become an annual ritual - the airing of an aged british comedy sketch starring a long-dead music-hall comedy called " dinner for one . " the 15-minute sketch , acted by freddie frinton and may warden , will also be televised by every other major regional public-tv channel in germany and by a scattering of commercial networks . the black-and-white british slapstick sketch , totally unknown in the english-speaking world , has become the highest-rated tv show in german history , and has spawned fan clubs and a cult following of viewers who stage parties to recreate the sketch at home . in a nation not exactly known for its ribaldry and thigh-slapping humor , the new year 's eve showing of " dinner for one " never fails to bring down the house .
there are viewers who have memorized every gesture , every line of the english-only sketch . same procedure … the mere mention of the tag-line , " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " will break the ice with the sternest of stern-faced germans .
mention that line , regardless of the situation , and be prepared for the german to reply with , " same procedure as every year , james , " and then collapse into hysterical laughter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks are an annual german tradition it is a phenomenon that has become ritualized into tradition .
" the dinner for one " sketch was originally performed in the 1920s in british music halls . in the early 1960s , a german television producer had caught the stage act in blackpool and invited frinton to fly back to hamburg with him to tape the sketch for a one-time broadcast in 1963 . studio employees and in-house secretaries served as the live audience for the sketch about a butler who gets riotously drunk while serving food and drinks to his employer , miss sophie , and her guests on her 90th birthday . the running joke is that she sits alone at the table because she has outlived all her male guests who were her former lovers .
butler james assumes the role of each ' guest ' in order to toast miss sophie with champagne , wine , port and so on throughout the meal .
before each toast , he asks plaintively : " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " to which she responds , " the same procedure as every year , james . " the " same procedure " line is repeated one final time after dinner as butler james escorts miss sophie upstairs to bed , with frinton leering knowingly at the audience and affirming , " i 'll do me very best ! " the highest ratings the sketch was used as a new year 's eve filler on ndr television in hamburg in the early 1970s and it quickly became a regular part of german new year 's eve celebrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : butler james has wowed german viewers since 1963 over the years somehow , it has become a cult classic in germany - to the extent that it is shown on dozens of regional channels at some point over new year and ndr shows it six or seven times during new year 's eve . " it usually has the highest rating of any program shown during the year , " says jürgen meier-beer , ndr 's head of entertainment .
" we have an average market share in our area of 8 percent .
' dinner for one ' gets us up to 20 to 30 percent every time .
we reckon that one in every two viewers in our area will watch it at some point on new year 's eve . " in recent years , it has also been shown in austria , switzerland , denmark and other countries . ironically , frinton died long before his sketch made him a household name across central europe . getting in on the joke many germans are shocked to learn that the rest of the world is ignorant of this pearl of british humor . english-speaking visitors to germany are invariably flummoxed by continual references to this obscure sketch .
in a bid to make casual conversation , a german might ask , " what do you think of ' dinner for one ' ? " " ' dinner for one ' what , " is often the reply . " you know - ' dinner for one ' - ' james , miss sophie , same procedure as every year ? " '
and then they break into an uncontrolled fit of giggles . a silly moment of merriment also , germans are amazed that few people in britain under the age of 50 know who frinton was .
in fact , frinton was a master at playing comic drunks and had a huge following on british television in the 1950s . he was a bit past his prime when he taped the german version of his popular sketch .
viewed for the first time , the sketch seems dated and stale , an impression not helped by the fact that it was shot in black and white , and recorded on videotape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate hosts a showy new year 's party but what germans love about " dinner for one " is the fact that it is a silly moment of merriment that has become enshrined in the nation 's psyche .
people remember seeing it when they were young and with people who are no longer present , and they remember new year 's eves gone by . the sketch , of course , improves from repeated viewing , not unlike the rocky horror picture show .
and on new year 's eve , of course , many viewers have been raising their glasses in toasts all evening already and are as smashed as frinton 's character in the sketch .
that makes it easy for millions to slur the lines right along with the inebriated butler . never shown in britain what many people in germany do n't realize is that the sketch has never been shown in either britain or the us , though it has had a few showings on australian cable tv . but then , there are those german-language figures who are unknown in germany .
when a german asks what you think of " dinner for one , " one can respond by asking what they think of " the sound of music . " then the shoe will be on the other foot .
one can even launch into a rendition of the song , " edelweiss . "

" the 15-minute sketch , acted by freddie frinton and may warden , will also be televised by every other major regional public-tv channel in germany and by a scattering of commercial networks . the black-and-white british slapstick sketch , totally unknown in the english-speaking world , has become the highest-rated tv show in german history , and has spawned fan clubs and a cult following of viewers who stage parties to recreate the sketch at home . in a nation not exactly known for its ribaldry and thigh-slapping humor , the new year 's eve showing of " dinner for one " never fails to bring down the house .
there are viewers who have memorized every gesture , every line of the english-only sketch . same procedure … the mere mention of the tag-line , " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " will break the ice with the sternest of stern-faced germans .
mention that line , regardless of the situation , and be prepared for the german to reply with , " same procedure as every year , james , " and then collapse into hysterical laughter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks are an annual german tradition it is a phenomenon that has become ritualized into tradition .
" the dinner for one " sketch was originally performed in the 1920s in british music halls . in the early 1960s , a german television producer had caught the stage act in blackpool and invited frinton to fly back to hamburg with him to tape the sketch for a one-time broadcast in 1963 . studio employees and in-house secretaries served as the live audience for the sketch about a butler who gets riotously drunk while serving food and drinks to his employer , miss sophie , and her guests on her 90th birthday . the running joke is that she sits alone at the table because she has outlived all her male guests who were her former lovers .
butler james assumes the role of each ' guest ' in order to toast miss sophie with champagne , wine , port and so on throughout the meal .
before each toast , he asks plaintively : " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " to which she responds , " the same procedure as every year , james . " the " same procedure " line is repeated one final time after dinner as butler james escorts miss sophie upstairs to bed , with frinton leering knowingly at the audience and affirming , " i 'll do me very best ! " the highest ratings the sketch was used as a new year 's eve filler on ndr television in hamburg in the early 1970s and it quickly became a regular part of german new year 's eve celebrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : butler james has wowed german viewers since 1963 over the years somehow , it has become a cult classic in germany - to the extent that it is shown on dozens of regional channels at some point over new year and ndr shows it six or seven times during new year 's eve . " it usually has the highest rating of any program shown during the year , " says jürgen meier-beer , ndr 's head of entertainment .
" we have an average market share in our area of 8 percent .
' dinner for one ' gets us up to 20 to 30 percent every time .
we reckon that one in every two viewers in our area will watch it at some point on new year 's eve . " in recent years , it has also been shown in austria , switzerland , denmark and other countries . ironically , frinton died long before his sketch made him a household name across central europe . getting in on the joke many germans are shocked to learn that the rest of the world is ignorant of this pearl of british humor . english-speaking visitors to germany are invariably flummoxed by continual references to this obscure sketch .
in a bid to make casual conversation , a german might ask , " what do you think of ' dinner for one ' ? " " ' dinner for one ' what , " is often the reply . " you know - ' dinner for one ' - ' james , miss sophie , same procedure as every year ? " '
and then they break into an uncontrolled fit of giggles . a silly moment of merriment also , germans are amazed that few people in britain under the age of 50 know who frinton was .
in fact , frinton was a master at playing comic drunks and had a huge following on british television in the 1950s . he was a bit past his prime when he taped the german version of his popular sketch .
viewed for the first time , the sketch seems dated and stale , an impression not helped by the fact that it was shot in black and white , and recorded on videotape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate hosts a showy new year 's party but what germans love about " dinner for one " is the fact that it is a silly moment of merriment that has become enshrined in the nation 's psyche .
people remember seeing it when they were young and with people who are no longer present , and they remember new year 's eves gone by . the sketch , of course , improves from repeated viewing , not unlike the rocky horror picture show .
and on new year 's eve , of course , many viewers have been raising their glasses in toasts all evening already and are as smashed as frinton 's character in the sketch .
that makes it easy for millions to slur the lines right along with the inebriated butler . never shown in britain what many people in germany do n't realize is that the sketch has never been shown in either britain or the us , though it has had a few showings on australian cable tv . but then , there are those german-language figures who are unknown in germany .
when a german asks what you think of " dinner for one , " one can respond by asking what they think of " the sound of music . " then the shoe will be on the other foot .
one can even launch into a rendition of the song , " edelweiss . "

" the 15-minute sketch , acted by freddie frinton and may warden , will also be televised by every other major regional public-tv channel in germany and by a scattering of commercial networks . the black-and-white british slapstick sketch , totally unknown in the english-speaking world , has become the highest-rated tv show in german history , and has spawned fan clubs and a cult following of viewers who stage parties to recreate the sketch at home . in a nation not exactly known for its ribaldry and thigh-slapping humor , the new year 's eve showing of " dinner for one " never fails to bring down the house .
there are viewers who have memorized every gesture , every line of the english-only sketch . same procedure … the mere mention of the tag-line , " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " will break the ice with the sternest of stern-faced germans .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks are an annual german tradition it is a phenomenon that has become ritualized into tradition .
" the dinner for one " sketch was originally performed in the 1920s in british music halls . in the early 1960s , a german television producer had caught the stage act in blackpool and invited frinton to fly back to hamburg with him to tape the sketch for a one-time broadcast in 1963 . studio employees and in-house secretaries served as the live audience for the sketch about a butler who gets riotously drunk while serving food and drinks to his employer , miss sophie , and her guests on her 90th birthday . the running joke is that she sits alone at the table because she has outlived all her male guests who were her former lovers .
butler james assumes the role of each ' guest ' in order to toast miss sophie with champagne , wine , port and so on throughout the meal .
before each toast , he asks plaintively : " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " to which she responds , " the same procedure as every year , james . " the " same procedure " line is repeated one final time after dinner as butler james escorts miss sophie upstairs to bed , with frinton leering knowingly at the audience and affirming , " i 'll do me very best ! " the highest ratings the sketch was used as a new year 's eve filler on ndr television in hamburg in the early 1970s and it quickly became a regular part of german new year 's eve celebrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : butler james has wowed german viewers since 1963 over the years somehow , it has become a cult classic in germany - to the extent that it is shown on dozens of regional channels at some point over new year and ndr shows it six or seven times during new year 's eve . " it usually has the highest rating of any program shown during the year , " says jürgen meier-beer , ndr 's head of entertainment .
" we have an average market share in our area of 8 percent .
' dinner for one ' gets us up to 20 to 30 percent every time .
we reckon that one in every two viewers in our area will watch it at some point on new year 's eve . " in recent years , it has also been shown in austria , switzerland , denmark and other countries . ironically , frinton died long before his sketch made him a household name across central europe . getting in on the joke many germans are shocked to learn that the rest of the world is ignorant of this pearl of british humor . english-speaking visitors to germany are invariably flummoxed by continual references to this obscure sketch .
in a bid to make casual conversation , a german might ask , " what do you think of ' dinner for one ' ? " " ' dinner for one ' what , " is often the reply . " you know - ' dinner for one ' - ' james , miss sophie , same procedure as every year ? " '
and then they break into an uncontrolled fit of giggles . a silly moment of merriment also , germans are amazed that few people in britain under the age of 50 know who frinton was .
in fact , frinton was a master at playing comic drunks and had a huge following on british television in the 1950s . he was a bit past his prime when he taped the german version of his popular sketch .
viewed for the first time , the sketch seems dated and stale , an impression not helped by the fact that it was shot in black and white , and recorded on videotape .

people remember seeing it when they were young and with people who are no longer present , and they remember new year 's eves gone by . the sketch , of course , improves from repeated viewing , not unlike the rocky horror picture show .
and on new year 's eve , of course , many viewers have been raising their glasses in toasts all evening already and are as smashed as frinton 's character in the sketch .

" if we were to be satisfied with the first success that we 've had , then the economic upturn would turn in to a flash in the pan just like so often in the past , " according to a transcript of merkel 's speech which will be broadcast on german television on sunday evening . the chancellor , leader of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she was aware of the painful impact of some of her government 's reform policies but stressed that the current economic upswing and the fall in the number of jobless in 2006 showed that the government was on the right track . " that can only give us more encouragement , " merkel said . cutting unemployment will be priority in 2007 the chancellor 's speech also signals a rejection of calls by kurt beck , chairman of the cdu 's coalition partner , the social democrats , to slow down the pace of reform . this week , beck stirred debate by saying germans could not weather further reforms and that their endurance levels had been stretched to the maximum by painful social and economic reforms this year alone . however , merkel and her cdu colleagues as well as german president horst köhler , have strongly disputed beck 's comments , saying that structural reform was absolutely necessary if germany had to survive in the global marketplace and remain internationally competitive . merkel also underlined that her primary goal for 2007 would be to cut unemployment .
other aims , she said , would include streamlining the government budget , investing in education and research , improving energy efficiency and fighting climate change . referring to germany taking on both the eu and g8 presidencies on jan 1 , 2007 , merkel said that europe would work if every nation did their homework well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 31.12.2006 europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein 's execution was the focus of newspapers across the world as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems . newspapers in europe , which on sunday caught up with broadcasters and the internet in focusing on former iraqi dictator saddam hussein 's execution for crimes against humanity , were largely in agreement that the hanging would do little to change things on the ground in iraq . the sunday telegraph in london said it would be " naive to think that his -lrb- saddam hussein 's -rrb- execution will end the growing sectarian violence that has gripped iraq since the us-led invasion toppled saddam in march 2003 . " but it conceded that the hanging " might sow a necessary seed of separation between " loyalists of the secular baath party that had ruled iraq for three decades and the islamist extremists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi state television broadcast graphic images of the execution " the execution has definitively robbed the former group of a symbolic figurehead and any hope of a recognizable baathist revival , " the right-leaning newspaper said in an editorial .
the dictator 's death " may yet open up a tiny chink of hope , " it concluded . the left-leaning independent on sunday said saddam 's execution defied moves worldwide in recent decades to scrap the death penalty and " can too easily be portrayed throughout the arab and muslim worlds as victor 's justice . " " this is not the beginning of a new iraq " the italian press also agreed that the execution had " divided the world " and would not " end the nightmare of the iraqis . " the business daily il sole 24 ore said " this is not the beginning of a new iraq , " while il messagero concluded that dialogue was urgently needed in iraq but " the necessary conditions to do not exist , and that death of saddam will not help this . " only the turin-based daily la stampa saw saddam 's death as " possibly a turning point for a country finally united by the disappearance of the person chiefly responsible for its ruin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many iraqis were jubilant at news of the execution , but violence continued unabated spain 's respected daily el pais said that in executing saddam the iraqi government " lamentably succumbed to an easy temptation . " the government " may or may not gain greater public backing but the arab country is no better off today , nor is its future more promising with the elimination of the man from tikrit , " sadam 's hometown . " with the precipitate and quasi-clandestine hanging of the tyrant , baghdad has not just lost an opportunity to show magnanimity that iraq desperately needs if it is to have the least chink of home .
it has also lost the chance to carry on judging saddam for his crimes against humanity and expose to iraqis the truth behind his appalling reign in all its gore . " " now what ?

" but it conceded that the hanging " might sow a necessary seed of separation between " loyalists of the secular baath party that had ruled iraq for three decades and the islamist extremists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi state television broadcast graphic images of the execution " the execution has definitively robbed the former group of a symbolic figurehead and any hope of a recognizable baathist revival , " the right-leaning newspaper said in an editorial .

" the 15-minute sketch , acted by freddie frinton and may warden , will also be televised by every other major regional public-tv channel in germany and by a scattering of commercial networks . the black-and-white british slapstick sketch , totally unknown in the english-speaking world , has become the highest-rated tv show in german history , and has spawned fan clubs and a cult following of viewers who stage parties to recreate the sketch at home . in a nation not exactly known for its ribaldry and thigh-slapping humor , the new year 's eve showing of " dinner for one " never fails to bring down the house .
there are viewers who have memorized every gesture , every line of the english-only sketch . same procedure … the mere mention of the tag-line , " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " will break the ice with the sternest of stern-faced germans .
mention that line , regardless of the situation , and be prepared for the german to reply with , " same procedure as every year , james , " and then collapse into hysterical laughter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks are an annual german tradition it is a phenomenon that has become ritualized into tradition .
" the dinner for one " sketch was originally performed in the 1920s in british music halls . in the early 1960s , a german television producer had caught the stage act in blackpool and invited frinton to fly back to hamburg with him to tape the sketch for a one-time broadcast in 1963 . studio employees and in-house secretaries served as the live audience for the sketch about a butler who gets riotously drunk while serving food and drinks to his employer , miss sophie , and her guests on her 90th birthday . the running joke is that she sits alone at the table because she has outlived all her male guests who were her former lovers .
butler james assumes the role of each ' guest ' in order to toast miss sophie with champagne , wine , port and so on throughout the meal .
before each toast , he asks plaintively : " same procedure as last year , miss sophie " to which she responds , " the same procedure as every year , james . " the " same procedure " line is repeated one final time after dinner as butler james escorts miss sophie upstairs to bed , with frinton leering knowingly at the audience and affirming , " i 'll do me very best ! " the highest ratings the sketch was used as a new year 's eve filler on ndr television in hamburg in the early 1970s and it quickly became a regular part of german new year 's eve celebrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : butler james has wowed german viewers since 1963 over the years somehow , it has become a cult classic in germany - to the extent that it is shown on dozens of regional channels at some point over new year and ndr shows it six or seven times during new year 's eve . " it usually has the highest rating of any program shown during the year , " says jürgen meier-beer , ndr 's head of entertainment .
" we have an average market share in our area of 8 percent .
' dinner for one ' gets us up to 20 to 30 percent every time .
we reckon that one in every two viewers in our area will watch it at some point on new year 's eve . " in recent years , it has also been shown in austria , switzerland , denmark and other countries . ironically , frinton died long before his sketch made him a household name across central europe . getting in on the joke many germans are shocked to learn that the rest of the world is ignorant of this pearl of british humor . english-speaking visitors to germany are invariably flummoxed by continual references to this obscure sketch .
in a bid to make casual conversation , a german might ask , " what do you think of ' dinner for one ' ? " " ' dinner for one ' what , " is often the reply . " you know - ' dinner for one ' - ' james , miss sophie , same procedure as every year ? " '
and then they break into an uncontrolled fit of giggles . a silly moment of merriment also , germans are amazed that few people in britain under the age of 50 know who frinton was .
in fact , frinton was a master at playing comic drunks and had a huge following on british television in the 1950s . he was a bit past his prime when he taped the german version of his popular sketch .
viewed for the first time , the sketch seems dated and stale , an impression not helped by the fact that it was shot in black and white , and recorded on videotape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate hosts a showy new year 's party but what germans love about " dinner for one " is the fact that it is a silly moment of merriment that has become enshrined in the nation 's psyche .
people remember seeing it when they were young and with people who are no longer present , and they remember new year 's eves gone by . the sketch , of course , improves from repeated viewing , not unlike the rocky horror picture show .
and on new year 's eve , of course , many viewers have been raising their glasses in toasts all evening already and are as smashed as frinton 's character in the sketch .
that makes it easy for millions to slur the lines right along with the inebriated butler . never shown in britain what many people in germany do n't realize is that the sketch has never been shown in either britain or the us , though it has had a few showings on australian cable tv . but then , there are those german-language figures who are unknown in germany .
when a german asks what you think of " dinner for one , " one can respond by asking what they think of " the sound of music . " then the shoe will be on the other foot .
one can even launch into a rendition of the song , " edelweiss . "

the two nations in south-eastern europe are relatively unknown in the rest of europe in terms of their popular culture , including music and television .
here is a sample of what the average romanian and bulgarian settles down to watch on the small screen , and which pop stars are making the biggest splash as the neighbouring countries enter the european club .
bulgarian pop music in market places , cafes , shops and bars across bulgaria , it 's likely that chalga music will be blaring out of the stereo .
this vibrant , heady mixture of traditional balkan folk music with roma -lrb- gypsy -rrb- , turkish and arab influences is highly popular .
but it is sometimes frowned upon for its scantily-clad female singers and appeal to " low class people " .
" i rather like it .
at least it 's bulgarian , " says magdalena rahn of the sofia echo newspaper .
" the rhythms are catchy and the voices incredible .
i would prefer azis to western pop music being played here , " she adds .
flamboyant , cross-dressing male vocalist azis is one of the most recognised faces in bulgaria .
a leading exponent of chalga , he represented his country alongside pop star mariana popova at this year 's eurovision song contest .
western music has been widely embraced by bulgarian artists and regularly dominates the country 's charts , alongside the likes of justin timberlake and gwen stefani .
bulgaria 's best-known rap duo rumaneca and enchev are currently riding high in the hit parade along with male singer grafa -lrb- the count -rrb- - deemed " not particularly bulgarian " by ms rahn .
the country 's rock scene thrives thanks to bands lik epizod , who have turned traditional bulgarian songs into rock anthems .
the group have performed clad in armour with the backing of a church choir and folk dancers .
romanian pop music romania 's most recent musical phenomenon is cleopatra stratan .
aged just three , this diminutive talent dominated the charts recently with her song ghita and has already recorded an album .
the daughter of singer pavel stratan is said to have been discovered when she performed at his recording sessions .
acts who have been in the business rather longer include rock band voltaj , who formed in 1982 under the communist regime of nicolae ceausescu .
once considered a " danger to society " , they did not record their first album until 1995 and won best romanian act at the mtv europe music awards a decade later .
rockers holograf - currently in the romanian top 10 with voltaj - started life in 1978 .
popular names on the romanian dance scene include dj project - best romanian act at this year 's mtv europe awards - and akcent and morandi .
prolific songwriter and performer marius moga has penned numerous hits for these acts , earning himself the title " little mozart " .
as in bulgaria , romania 's acts have to battle hard against songs from the us and uk which often dominate the country 's top 10 .
bulgarian television one of bulgaria 's most popular tv programmes is a late-night daily talk show hosted by slavi trifonov , one of the most popular figures in the country .
the show 's makers claim its hour-long mix of guests , political satire and musical performances is " unique in eastern europe " .
other small-screen draws in bulgaria include localised versions of such familiar tv programmes as big brother , currently in its third series , and survivor bg .
the country has also spawned its own derivative of deal or no deal - known as sdelka ili ne in bulgaria - which offers a top prize of 100,000 leva -lrb- £ 34,620 -rrb- .
romanian television romanian tv has come a long way since the dark days of the ceausescu era .
back then , all viewers had to look forward to was two hours of black-and-white programming extolling the dictator 's virtues .
the country now has 10 commercial stations to complement the three channels offered by state television .
a set of familiar entertainment programmes are " watched by the whole nation " , says radio romania international 's iulian muresan .
probably the most popular , he continues , is surprize surprize - similar to the show hosted by cillia black in the uk from 1984-99 .
its tearful reunions are interspersed with regular appearances by bebelusele - female dancing girls - which are a common feature on numerous romanian tv programmes .
other highly-rated shows include iarta-ma -lrb- forgive me -rrb- , where old scores are settled and one-time adversaries start afresh in front of a studio audience , and dansez pentru tine , based on competitive dance shows seen around the world .
the country 's most popular comedy show is cronica carcotasilor -lrb- the fault finder 's chronicle -rrb- , which takes an irreverent look at romania 's political leaders , prominent people in the media and famous faces .
this programme also has a coterie of female dancers who perform between sketches .

the two nations in south-eastern europe are relatively unknown in the rest of europe in terms of their popular culture , including music and television .
here is a sample of what the average romanian and bulgarian settles down to watch on the small screen , and which pop stars are making the biggest splash as the neighbouring countries enter the european club .
bulgarian pop music watch azis perform kato skitnica in market places , cafes , shops and bars across bulgaria , it 's likely that chalga music will be blaring out of the stereo .
this vibrant , heady mixture of traditional balkan folk music with roma -lrb- gypsy -rrb- , turkish and arab influences is highly popular .
but it is sometimes frowned upon for its scantily-clad female singers and appeal to " low class people " .
" i rather like it .
at least it 's bulgarian , " says magdalena rahn of the sofia echo newspaper .
" the rhythms are catchy and the voices incredible .
i would prefer azis to western pop music being played here , " she adds .
flamboyant , cross-dressing male vocalist azis is one of the most recognised faces in bulgaria .
a leading exponent of chalga , he represented his country alongside pop star mariana popova at this year 's eurovision song contest .
western music has been widely embraced by bulgarian artists and regularly dominates the country 's charts , alongside the likes of justin timberlake and gwen stefani .
watch rumaneca and enchev perform shatrata bulgaria 's best-known rap duo rumaneca and enchev are currently riding high in the hit parade along with male singer grafa -lrb- the count -rrb- - deemed " not particularly bulgarian " by ms rahn .
the country 's rock scene thrives thanks to bands lik epizod , who have turned traditional bulgarian songs into rock anthems .
the group have performed clad in armour with the backing of a church choir and folk dancers .
romanian pop music romania 's most recent musical phenomenon is cleopatra stratan .
aged just three , this diminutive talent dominated the charts recently with her song ghita and has already recorded an album .
watch cleopatra perform ghita the daughter of singer pavel stratan is said to have been discovered when she performed at his recording sessions .
acts who have been in the business rather longer include rock band voltaj , who formed in 1982 under the communist regime of nicolae ceausescu .
once considered a " danger to society " , they did not record their first album until 1995 and won best romanian act at the mtv europe music awards a decade later .
rockers holograf - currently in the romanian top 10 with voltaj - started life in 1978 .
watch holograf perform asa frumoasa popular names on the romanian dance scene include dj project - best romanian act at this year 's mtv europe awards - and akcent and morandi .
prolific songwriter and performer marius moga has penned numerous hits for these acts , earning himself the title " little mozart " .
as in bulgaria , romania 's acts have to battle hard against songs from the us and uk which often dominate the country 's top 10 .
bulgarian television one of bulgaria 's most popular tv programmes is a late-night daily talk show hosted by slavi trifonov , one of the most popular figures in the country .
chat show host slavi trifonov also has a reputation as a musician the show 's makers claim its hour-long mix of guests , political satire and musical performances is " unique in eastern europe " .
other small-screen draws in bulgaria include localised versions of such familiar tv programmes as big brother , currently in its third series , and survivor bg .
the country has also spawned its own derivative of deal or no deal - known as sdelka ili ne in bulgaria - which offers a top prize of 100,000 leva -lrb- £ 34,620 -rrb- .
romanian television watch a clip from dansez pentru tine romanian tv has come a long way since the dark days of the ceausescu era .
back then , all viewers had to look forward to was two hours of black-and-white programming extolling the dictator 's virtues .
the country now has 10 commercial stations to complement the three channels offered by state television .
a set of familiar entertainment programmes are " watched by the whole nation " , says radio romania international 's iulian muresan .
probably the most popular , he continues , is surprize surprize - similar to the show hosted by cillia black in the uk from 1984-99 .

general sir michael rose told the independent on sunday that despite statements to the contrary troops were not getting the support they should .
the " military ethos " was being undermined by new laws , he said .
but the ministry of defence said it recognised the importance of investing in the armed forces .
the ex-bosnia un chief 's comments come in the wake of calls from the head of british forces in southern iraq for national support for soldiers serving in the country . "
the infantry is the vital combat arm in insurgency warfare , yet manpower has continued to fall " gen sir michael rose issues such as underfunding had to be addressed to maintain their quality of work , major general richard shirreff said , but the ministry of defence said spending had risen steadily .
writing in the paper , sir michael said although defence secretary des browne maintained there had been an increase in spending in the last three years , most had gone on technical programmes such as trident replacement .
he said : " in the past six years , the prime minister has presided over a near-catastrophic decline in defence spending which has put our soldiers in iraq and afghanistan at considerable and quite unnecessary risk . "
" for fighting insurgencies such as those in afghanistan and iraq we need rather large numbers of soldiers on the ground , proper protection and tactical mobility , including helicopters , " he added .
" the infantry is the vital combat arm in insurgency warfare , yet manpower has continued to fall . "
' blood brother ' he said that it had been " tremendously heartening " for servicemen and women to see senior military " standing up for them " by speaking out about resources .
health and safety and equal opportunity laws and " risk management " were damaging the military ethos , he said , adding that good command and effective military tactics were better than " imposed civil law " .
on president george w bush and tony blair 's handling of iraq , sir michael wrote : " they tell us it is the iraqi government that runs the country .
" this is disgraceful hand-washing .
they know , under the geneva conventions , they were responsible for the disastrous breakdown of law and order in the country they invaded . "
but he said mr bush had at least " put his money where his mouth was " by giving resources and support to his troops .
sir michael has previously called for mr blair to be impeached over iraq , for going to war on " false grounds " .
an mod spokesman said : " defence spending has been steadily increasing .
" last year alone we spent more than £ 700m on improvements to service housing , announced the introduction of a new £ 2,240 operational bonus and invested millions more in new equipment , including body armour and armoured vehicles . "

general sir michael rose told the independent on sunday that despite statements to the contrary troops were not getting the support they should .
the " military ethos " was being undermined by new laws , he said .
but the ministry of defence said it recognised the importance of investing in the armed forces .
the ex-bosnia un chief 's comments come in the wake of calls from the head of british forces in southern iraq for national support for soldiers serving in the country .

writing in the paper , sir michael said although defence secretary des browne maintained there had been an increase in spending in the last three years , most had gone on technical programmes such as trident replacement .
he said : " in the past six years , the prime minister has presided over a near-catastrophic decline in defence spending which has put our soldiers in iraq and afghanistan at considerable and quite unnecessary risk . "
" for fighting insurgencies such as those in afghanistan and iraq we need rather large numbers of soldiers on the ground , proper protection and tactical mobility , including helicopters , " he added .

' blood brother ' he said that it had been " tremendously heartening " for servicemen and women to see senior military " standing up for them " by speaking out about resources .
health and safety and equal opportunity laws and " risk management " were damaging the military ethos , he said , adding that good command and effective military tactics were better than " imposed civil law " .
on president george w bush and tony blair 's handling of iraq , sir michael wrote : " they tell us it is the iraqi government that runs the country .
" this is disgraceful hand-washing .
they know , under the geneva conventions , they were responsible for the disastrous breakdown of law and order in the country they invaded . "
but he said mr bush had at least " put his money where his mouth was " by giving resources and support to his troops .
sir michael has previously called for mr blair to be impeached over iraq , for going to war on " false grounds " .
an mod spokesman said : " defence spending has been steadily increasing .
" last year alone we spent more than £ 700m on improvements to service housing , announced the introduction of a new £ 2,240 operational bonus and invested millions more in new equipment , including body armour and armoured vehicles . "

here she talks about the stellar year she has enjoyed and how she has managed to keep her feet firmly on the ground since finding fame .
the top five acts in the sound of 2007 survey will be counted down every day from monday to friday , when the winner and full top 10 will be revealed .
over the past twelve months , corinne bailey rae has graduated from promising newcomer to one of the country 's most cherished artists , selling almost 2.5 million copies of her self-titled debut album .
" i 'm really just pleased with the response , " she says .
" it feels like all of the people i 've met have been able to discover the album and it has n't been forced down their throats .
" there are all different kinds of people at the gigs , from teenagers to 60-year-olds .
" and in america there 's a really big gay following .
" i feel like we have n't tried to target it .
it 's just a bunch of songs i 've worked on that hopefully are good . "
rae 's broad appeal comes from her timeless , finely-crafted songs that hark back to the classic sounds of stax and motown .
her soulful melodies and dusky , vulnerable voice have earned her two mobo awards and mojo magazine 's prize for best new act .
and she has also received three grammy nominations , including in the prestigious record of the year and song of the year categories .
avoiding celebrity but this time last year , rae said she wanted to " keep in the background " and " sneak home to leeds " as often as possible .
has she been able to achieve those aims ?
" it 's been a real effort , but yes , " she says . "
the one weird thing is who you get compared to - it 's billie holiday in one country and tina turner in another " corinne bailey rae " press agents organise things where people go out and get drunk and their agent rings up the papers and says : ' so-and-so is going to be stumbling out of this pub . '
" i did n't realise it was as contrived and set up as that , but i 've made a massive effort not to do it . "
rae may have managed to stay out of the gossip columns , but she has still been the focus of press attention wherever she has gone .
" you get the same questions everywhere , " she smiles .
" but the one weird thing is who you get compared to .
" it 's billie holiday in one country , tina turner in another and nelly furtado somewhere else .
" and my biography got mis-translated in france , so i always get asked about my dad being indian , even though he comes from the west indies . "
with her album released in 60 countries , rae says she has accumulated " so many air miles " in 2006 , but has no problem remembering one of the highlights of her year .
" three or four days ago , i was singing onstage and stevie wonder introduced me , " she beams .
" i 've got to meet him twice and he invited me to play at this charity gig and he loves the record .
that 's a big highlight . "
another music legend was less impressive , though .
rae was due to play at prince 's las vegas club in december but the show was cancelled .
" we did n't do that because prince is being - i do n't know if i 'm allowed to say this - i guess he 's sort of difficult to pin down , " she says .
" but i suppose you want that from people of that level - you want that weirdness and elusiveness . "
second album she admits she does n't aim for prince 's iconic status - " i do n't want to be a world superstar " .
but that is part of her charm .
the singer is enjoying a christmas break until mid-january - but faces a hectic schedule when she returns .
" i can tell you exactly what i 'm doing , " she explains .
" we 're doing a little bit of tv , then we 're off to japan for 10 days , then we play the grammys and the brits .
after that is a tour , and the festivals .
" and then i 've got some space to write the next album . "

here she talks about the stellar year she has enjoyed and how she has managed to keep her feet firmly on the ground since finding fame .
the top five acts in the sound of 2007 survey will be counted down every day from monday to friday , when the winner and full top 10 will be revealed .
over the past twelve months , corinne bailey rae has graduated from promising newcomer to one of the country 's most cherished artists , selling almost 2.5 million copies of her self-titled debut album .
" i 'm really just pleased with the response , " she says .
corinne bailey rae starts a tour of europe and the us in the spring " it feels like all of the people i 've met have been able to discover the album and it has n't been forced down their throats .
" there are all different kinds of people at the gigs , from teenagers to 60-year-olds .
" and in america there 's a really big gay following .
" i feel like we have n't tried to target it .
it 's just a bunch of songs i 've worked on that hopefully are good . "
rae 's broad appeal comes from her timeless , finely-crafted songs that hark back to the classic sounds of stax and motown .
her soulful melodies and dusky , vulnerable voice have earned her two mobo awards and mojo magazine 's prize for best new act .
and she has also received three grammy nominations , including in the prestigious record of the year and song of the year categories .
avoiding celebrity but this time last year , rae said she wanted to " keep in the background " and " sneak home to leeds " as often as possible .
has she been able to achieve those aims ?
" it 's been a real effort , but yes , " she says .
the one weird thing is who you get compared to - it 's billie holiday in one country and tina turner in another corinne bailey rae " press agents organise things where people go out and get drunk and their agent rings up the papers and says : ' so-and-so is going to be stumbling out of this pub . '
" i did n't realise it was as contrived and set up as that , but i 've made a massive effort not to do it . "
rae may have managed to stay out of the gossip columns , but she has still been the focus of press attention wherever she has gone .
" you get the same questions everywhere , " she smiles .
" but the one weird thing is who you get compared to .
" it 's billie holiday in one country , tina turner in another and nelly furtado somewhere else .
" and my biography got mis-translated in france , so i always get asked about my dad being indian , even though he comes from the west indies . "
with her album released in 60 countries , rae says she has accumulated " so many air miles " in 2006 , but has no problem remembering one of the highlights of her year .
the singer rubbed shoulders with music legends in 2006 " three or four days ago , i was singing onstage and stevie wonder introduced me , " she beams .
" i 've got to meet him twice and he invited me to play at this charity gig and he loves the record .
that 's a big highlight . "
another music legend was less impressive , though .
rae was due to play at prince 's las vegas club in december but the show was cancelled .
" we did n't do that because prince is being - i do n't know if i 'm allowed to say this - i guess he 's sort of difficult to pin down , " she says .
" but i suppose you want that from people of that level - you want that weirdness and elusiveness . "
second album she admits she does n't aim for prince 's iconic status - " i do n't want to be a world superstar " .
but that is part of her charm .
the singer is enjoying a christmas break until mid-january - but faces a hectic schedule when she returns .
" i can tell you exactly what i 'm doing , " she explains .
" we 're doing a little bit of tv , then we 're off to japan for 10 days , then we play the grammys and the brits .
after that is a tour , and the festivals .
" and then i 've got some space to write the next album . "
